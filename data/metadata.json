        "article_text": "As Keir Starmer arrived at the Oval Office, Joe Biden was at the door to meet him. \u201cCome on in, man,\u201d the US president told him. The invitation was not simply to enter the heart of the White House, but also the major league of world leaders.\n\nThe day before, on the flight to Washington DC for the Nato summit on Tuesday, Starmer admitted that the days since the Labour party had pulled off its landslide election victory had been a bit of a whirlwind.\n\n\u201cThis time last week \u2026 I was just checking into a hotel that was more like a bed and breakfast in Carmarthen and about to do the last day of the campaign. And here we are now on the way to the Nato summit \u2013 so a real transition,\u201d he said.\n\nBiden was a generous host. The White House, not usually keen on bilateral talks during major international summits so as to avoid any individual nation feeling left out, made an exception for the newly elected Starmer.\n\nSitting alongside the prime minister under a portrait of Franklin D Roosevelt, Biden told reporters that the two countries were the \u201cbest of allies in the whole world\u201d, before their timetabled 45-minute meeting stretched to almost an hour.\n\nFor Starmer, the visit could not have come at a better time. Just five days into office, and with a massive parliamentary majority of 174 under his belt, other leaders wanted to find out how he had done it, especially those facing political headwinds at home. \u201cEverybody loves a winner,\u201d said one official.\n\nOver the course of two days in DC, Starmer and his team of David Lammy, the foreign secretary, and John Healey, the defence secretary, managed between them to meet every one of the other 31 Nato leaders.\n\nThey included natural allies \u2013 progressives such as Justin Trudeau of Canada and Olaf Scholz of Germany \u2013 but also those less likely to be regarded as natural political bedfellows, such as Italy\u2019s Georgia Meloni and Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the Hungarian prime minister who put Nato backs up by meeting Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump within the space of a week.\n\n\u201cLabour is looking to reset that and encourage more, even though there\u2019s a difference of political views,\u201d Healey said after a brief meeting with Orb\u00e1n.\n\nAs well as striking personal relationships \u2013 Starmer\u2019s preferred method of diplomacy \u2013 the summit also gave the prime minister the opportunity to show off his national security credentials to a domestic and international audience.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good early opportunity for me to set out my priorities, to obviously engage with other international leaders,\u201d he said in a television interview midway through the summit.\n\n\u201cTo have that within the first two weeks or so of an incoming Labour government is a really good opportunity to address core values \u2026 about the commitment to Nato, the importance of the defence on Ukraine. And with my bilateral with the president of the US here yesterday, to be very clear about the nature and importance of the special relationship between our two countries.\u201d\n\nAt Starmer\u2019s side was his wife, Victoria, who despite opting not to have a high-profile public role herself, was there to support her husband at his first international summit.\n\nHer brief public appearances \u2013 wearing a \u00a3450 cream, lace-knit dress from the British label Needle & Thread as she walked down the plane steps at Andrews air force base, and in a \u00a3329 tomato red dress from the French company The Kooples for a White House welcome dinner \u2013 added some glamour.\n\nBut she also brought a human touch to an otherwise formal event: Starmer credits his wife and children for keeping him grounded. Aides said she hit it off, in particular, with Olena Zelenska, the Ukrainian president\u2019s wife.\n\nAt the glitzy White House dinner, guests were treated to a dinner of charcoal-grilled beef tenderloin and Alaskan halibut \u2013 although presumably not the vegetarian Starmers \u2013 and a military fly-past which they watched from the balcony, Victoria\u2019s arm draped around her husband\u2019s shoulder.\n\nStarmer once again proved himself to be a lucky general, with England qualifying for the Euro 2024 final during the summit, creating a feelgood factor at home that Downing Street will hope continues.\n\nThe prime minister, a passionate football fan, revealed that he stepped out of meetings to watch part of the semi-final with the Dutch prime minister, Dick Schoof, and caught Harry Kane scoring England\u2019s first goal. He missed the second, but aides suggested he would watch it when he got home.\n\nEven Biden got in on the act, shaking Starmer\u2019s hand in the Oval Office and declaring: \u201cEngland. In the finals! I\u2019ll tell you what \u2013 it\u2019s all because of the prime minister.\u201d Starmer laughed coyly and blushed.\n\nDespite the apparent success of Starmer\u2019s arrival on the world stage, he did not manage to escape the challenges waiting for him back home entirely. As the scale of the prisons overcrowding crisis became clear, he was asked questions at every turn about how he would handle it.\n\nThe prime minister also came under pressure over his commitment to defence, after he repeatedly refused to put a date on raising spending to 2.5% of GDP. Yet despite not setting out his own timetable, he said it was \u201cessential\u201d for Nato countries to match that target.\n\nThe biggest cloud over the heavy Washington sky was Biden\u2019s future. After the Oval Office talks, Starmer said he was \u201con good form\u201d and had gone through serious issues \u201cat pace\u201d. Aides in the room backed up his account, suggesting Biden had navigated the knotty details of foreign policy while also being quick-witted enough to make jokes.\n\nBut the US president\u2019s gaffe at the closing Nato press conference \u2013 introducing Volodymyr Zelenskiy as \u201cPresident Putin\u201d \u2013 fuelled yet more of the concerns about his mental acuity that have threatened to scuttle his presidential campaign.\n\nAt Starmer\u2019s own closing press conference, he was asked repeatedly for his views. He said little other than that the US president \u201cdeserved credit\u201d for the overall success of the summit, which he said had left the alliance stronger than ever.\n\nBut he is aware that the drama will overshadow what Downing Street regarded as a successful first international trip, and that after Sunday\u2019s final, public attention in England will refocus on the many domestic challenges ahead.\n\nStarmer, who has blamed the inheritance from the Tories for tough choices he will have to make, said he hoped people would be patient. \u201cWe can get started, roll up our sleeves and hit the ground running,\u201d he said. \u201cBut real long-term fixes will take time.\u201d",
