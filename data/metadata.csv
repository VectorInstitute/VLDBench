3a6e10c6e5,The New York Times,Opinion | An Unexpected Rebranding of the Democratic Party - The New York Times,"Democrats tend to do well in cities; Republicans tend to do well in rural areas. But winning back at least some rural voters is essential for Democrats to succeed in statewide elections. Farah Stockman, a member of the New York Times editorial board, found one Democrat who is trying out a new message in rural Ohio.

Below is a lightly edited transcript of the audio piece. To listen to this piece, click the play button below.

Farah Stockman: I’m Farah Stockman, and I am a member of the New York Times editorial board.

There are a lot of places in rural America today where Democrats are essentially going extinct.

Democrats do well in the cities, but they get clobbered in the small towns and rural areas. Winning back at least some of those rural voters is essential to success in statewide elections. In order to do that, Democrats have to rebrand themselves. They need a new, winning message.

I recently traveled to a place where I think they might’ve found one: Shelby County, Ohio. It’s about 90 miles west of Columbus. Registered Republicans outnumber Democrats more than eight to one there, so a lot of the Democrats in Shelby County are keeping a low profile.

One woman told me when I was there that this is a scary place to be a Democrat. She actually refuses to put up a political sign in her pasture because she’s afraid that someone would shoot her horses.

I went there to talk to this guy who is trying to revive the Democratic Party there and change this dynamic.

Audio clip of Chris Gibbs: Everybody on the planet is trying to find a secret, a silver bullet to reinvigorate rural America.

Stockman: His name is Chris Gibbs and he’s a farmer.

Clip of Gibbs: Yep, same time, 6:30. We’ll go back and check on the cows again.

Stockman: Chris is actually the last person you’d expect to lead the charge to revive the Democratic Party here, because he used to be a Republican. He was not just any Republican. He was the leader of the Republican Party in Shelby County for seven years, up until 2015.

He voted for Trump in 2016, hoping for the best, but after Trump was elected, then came this tariff war with China, which wiped out a lot of the value of his soybean crop. So he had a political conversion. He wrote a scathing op-ed against Trump in the local paper. After that, he got shunned by the Republican Party, where he’d spent most of his adult life, and he lost almost all his friends.

So he started looking at Democrats. Last year, he was elected as the leader of the Shelby County Democrats.

Clip of Gibbs: I speak legacy Republican. I don’t speak MAGA. And what I understand is the values of legacy Republicans match the values of existing Democrats in this county. Period. And all I gotta do is prove it. I just gotta prove it.

Stockman: Chris Gibbs’s idea is that he can explain that these Shelby County Democrats are traditional Democrats. They’re not all wild socialists. He is really bent on rebranding the party as the party of traditional American values, the party that cares about freedom, the party that cares about the value of work.

I saw this firsthand at the annual spring dinner for Shelby County Democrats. This dinner was held at the Sidney Elks Lodge. Sidney is the county seat of Shelby County.

This lodge had a big elk head mounted over the door, and it was a place where farmers sat around talking about calving season.

There were a lot of former Republicans in the room.

Clip of Stockman: Do you also consider yourself a former Republican, or —

Clip of attendee: I am a former Republican, yes. I voted for Reagan.

Stockman: It was an interesting scene to be a part of because a lot of the local people were saying, “This is the first time that I’m telling people I’m a Democrat” —

Clip of attendee: They hate the party of Donald Trump.

Stockman: — “or really answering the question of what party affiliation I lean toward.”

Clip of Gibbs: People are scared. They’re scared to stand up and say that I’m a Democrat and that I believe in Democratic principles. They’re scared of that. I’m going to tell you something. That ends tonight.

Stockman: Chris Gibbs was able to bring Tim Ryan, a former congressman who’s kind of a local celebrity, to give the keynote speech.

Clip of Tim Ryan: Freedom is a foundational value for us here in the United States.

Stockman: Tim Ryan has the same idea of trying to rebrand the Democratic Party in Shelby County and in Ohio as the party of freedom. And he gives the speech talking about the party platform essentially being a platform of freedom.

Clip of Ryan: Talking about women’s issues? That’s an issue of freedom. That is the ultimate government encroachment on the lives of its citizens. What’s going on with social media — and we allow these companies to just trick our little kids’ minds into getting dopamine hits in their head and staying on these machines forever. You are taking away the freedom of our kids.

Stockman: You’re seeing a lot of effort in rural America to use freedom as a focal point for rebranding the party. There’s a group called Democrats 101 that promotes a universal creed based on freedom, justice and opportunity. And countywide Democratic parties around the country are adapting this creed and using it as a way to explain why the Democratic Party is the party of traditional American values.

It’s really an interesting question about whether freedom can be a winning message. I think the jury is still out about that.

In Sidney, I went into the restaurant called The Spot, which is where everybody goes to eat their pie. They have famous pies. It was playing Fox News the whole time and it’s all about Democrats as socialists or pro-Hamas terrorists.

I also went into a barbershop where there were a lot of young guys. That really highlighted for me what might be the biggest challenge for Shelby County Democrats. In this barbershop, they were all in their 20s and they either were totally politically disengaged or they were enamored of Trump. And in the barbershop, one of the 20-year-olds was saying, “Yeah, well, Democrats today, they’re so far to the left. It’s not the party that it used to be.”

After I wrote my story, my editor told me to go back to Chris Gibbs and see “What does he say about those young guys in the barbershop?” I called him back and I explained what I’d heard in that barbershop and he admitted this is a challenge. But he said, I think that if we do our work now, those young people are going to give the Democratic Party a second look because the Democratic Party’s values in Shelby County are what these young people were raised with. It’s their parents’ values.",A man in a suit with a lapel pin stands against a plain background.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x117 at 0x7D6BA13E4E50>,2024-05-29 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/29/opinion/chris-gibbs-ohio-voters-democrats.html,['Politics' 'Opinion/Editorial'],[0.95 0.9 ],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/3a6e10c6e5.png
ab71f6bece,The Globe and Mail,"When things go wrong at funerals, you just have to laugh - The Globe and Mail","First Person is a daily personal piece submitted by readers. Have a story to tell? See our guidelines at tgam.ca/essayguide.

After Dad died at 100 years of age, the funeral director looked very serious as she promised us that what had happened at my mother’s interment would not happen again. I looked her in the eye and said that was the best part of the whole funeral and our family will never forget it.

Mom died 14 years earlier. After her church service and reception, we drove out in a convoy to the country cemetery where my parents had their plots. This small cemetery is tucked into a pine forest and the grounds are covered with wildflowers. It is the same cemetery where my grandparents and my in-laws are buried. My husband and I bought our own plots there soon after we were married. (It was a great buy in 1977 at only $60 each. The value of the plots has appreciated more than anything else we have purchased, including equities and real estate.)

My mother’s casket was placed in an antique hearse for the 30 kilometre drive to the cemetery.

About three kilometres from the cemetery, the coach suddenly stopped and would not restart. The funeral directors who had accompanied us were embarrassed and upset. We were not left with many options. We could not take the casket and put it in another vehicle and we could not walk down the road with the pallbearers carrying the casket. Eventually, another funeral home was called to deliver one of their hearses so we could move the casket and then carry on to the cemetery. But it would take almost an hour for the new car to arrive.

It was a warm mid-June Saturday and there was a steady line of vehicles on this country road. My brother and I decided to drive to a country store that we knew was just up the road and purchased about 40 popsicles, in all different colours and flavours.

When we returned to our convoy now parked on the side of the road, everyone had left their parked vehicles and were standing beside them chatting. We began handing out the popsicles, much appreciated in the warm weather and everyone dressed formally in black.

We offered popsicles to the funeral directors but they were worried that we were upset about what had happened. We told them that my mother was always positive, especially when met with challenging issues, and we were following her lead. After a little bit of persuading, even the funeral directors started to eat the popsicles and relax.

It was quite a scene: a funeral procession of about a dozen vehicles on the side of the road with people standing beside their cars licking brightly coloured popsicles and waving at passersby. Some drivers nearly went off the road it was so unexpected, especially when the casket was transferred to the new car.

We did eventually arrive at the cemetery and all went well. The old hearse had stopped because it ran out of gas – the gas gauge no longer worked.

While planning my Dad’s funeral the funeral director promised that every vehicle would be completely filled with fuel. And so when we had no problems in arriving at the cemetery, the funeral directors breathed a massive sigh of relief.

It is our family custom to lower caskets down into the ground after the committal and then shovel dirt upon the casket. When the time came, the funeral director took out a large crank and lowered the casket six feet into the ground. But then the crank flew off and landed at the bottom of the grave on top of the casket.

The funeral director could not believe that something completely out of the ordinary had happened again!

Without missing a beat, our eldest son had a solution. He said that he often lowers his son by the ankles over the neighbour’s fence to pick up lost balls. In a matter of seconds, our 9-year-old grandson was lowered head first into the grave. We unexpectedly laughed as we watched him disappear into the freshly dug grave. He retrieved the crank and was lifted out by his ankles. It all happened so quickly. If Dad was watching, he would have laughed the loudest.

I often go to the cemetery to water the flowers that I plant every year or light ice candles in the winter and I give thanks for my parents. I am thankful for the mirth that we were blessed with at both of their funerals. They were farewells that I know my wonderful parents would have appreciated.",A cartoon of a funeral scene with a person kneeling and a group of people standing around a grave.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x154 at 0x7D6B7EC00730>,2024-09-05 19:08:46.961000+00:00,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/first-person/article-when-things-go-wrong-at-funerals-you-just-have-to-laugh/,['Opinion/Editorial' 'Local/Regional'],[0.9 0.6],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/ab71f6bece.png
188c8526d3,Financial Times,"IM Pei, Hong Kong review — much more than just the Louvre Pyramid - Financial Times","IM Pei, the Chinese-American architect who died in 2019 at the age of 102, seems a perfect choice for the inaugural architecture exhibition in Hong Kong’s vast M+ museum. His towering Bank of China tower is visible over the water; like Hong Kong itself, his career straddled east and west, finance and art, commerce and culture. From his striking addition to the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC (1978) to his serene Museum of Islamic Art in Doha (2008), not to mention the controversial glass pyramid at the Louvre, you could call him the world’s first starchitect.

Yet this huge show, one of the largest devoted to an architect anywhere in years, does not entirely endorse this narrative. Instead it suggests that Pei was a member of a team, not solely responsible for his buildings but a figure who guided from the background. This is, of course, how architecture is mostly made — even if it is not the narrative we are used to.

It is notable that there are almost no drawings in Pei’s hand here later than his student years; no napkin sketches, presentation drawings, conceptual diagrams. There is one early sketch of the Louvre Pyramid but precious little else. If it weren’t for occasional video footage of him playing on screens, he would be almost entirely absent. Yet it is arguably this quality that makes him such a fascinating, enigmatic figure.

Instead, this is an exhibition about production, the work of an office. There are technical drawings alongside perspectives made for presentation, drawings for building as well as presenting. The sketches here (by other architects in the office) are not of the romantic lone genius kind (so often made after the event to make the process look creative) but rather scruffy scrawls, drawing as a way of working through a problem.

Ieoh Ming Pei was born in Canton (Guangzhou) in 1917, the scion of a wealthy family, descendants of the Ming dynasty. He went to study architecture in the US, where he was taught by Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius and became friends with another Bauhaus émigré, Marcel Breuer.

But his start came as a result of his relationship with the cigar-chomping real estate developer William Zeckendorf and his firm Webb & Knapp. In 1948, Pei leapt straight into the cut-throat world of commercial development, developing a reputation as a sensible, reliable, sometimes pliable architect, acceptable to corporate America. Even as a much older man, he maintained the well-tailored appearance of mid-century Midtown; woollen suits (whatever the weather), tie, French cuffs and the round, horn-rimmed glasses which recalled one of his idols Le Corbusier and made him look a little like Mole from The Wind in the Willows. One pair of glasses occupies its own vitrine here.

Together with Webb & Knapp, he built across the US, from Texas to Washington DC, some notable and some forgettable structures resulting. Pei got his break on his own with the enigmatic National Centre for Atmospheric Research outside Boulder, Colorado (1961-67). A complex piece of Brutalism set against the sublime backdrop of the Rockies, this was a building which blended the grandeur of antiquity and the drama of topography with a strong composition of light and shadow.

It led to his commission in 1964 to design the John F Kennedy Library in Dorchester, Boston. Jacqueline Kennedy had been charmed by Pei but the project was fraught with difficulty (changes of site after political objections, construction problems and progressive reductions in size); it was not completed for 15 years. Pei freely admitted its imperfections, yet it was this building that announced him to the world and set in place a style that became distinctive: triangular atriums, glass walls on a high-tech steel structure, soaring internal space and prow-like angles. Wandering around the show, the recurrence of these forms becomes clear, almost a little ridiculous, the motifs appearing and reappearing in every building and at every scale whether seemingly suitable or not.

The two projects that made Pei a household name (inasmuch as architects ever become household names) were the National Gallery of Art’s East Building (1968-78) in Washington, DC, and the Louvre Pyramid. Both were fraught interventions in much-loved classical buildings, both mostly vindicated. Their geometry, the scale of their public spaces and their democratic generosity awed a public which had become bored with the banality of late Modernism.

The line drawings aren’t especially revealing, but the renderings, by professional illustrators including the excellent Helmut Jacoby, J Henderson Barr and Paul Stevenson Oles, are for me the best things in the show. The office’s architectural drawings give little away — nothing of the massing or the space — so the illustrations were critical because Pei’s architecture was difficult to describe.

He was sparing with colour, an exemplar of the white and grey which characterised late Modernism. Look over the water from the museum terrace towards the Bank of China Building with its triangular grid and spiked crown and there too you find an architecture drained of colour, the glass appearing black, the structure white, the base granite grey. Bank employees have stuffed the public spaces with plastic flowers and trees. Twinkling ice-blue LEDs subsequently added to the outside allow it to meld into Hong Kong’s skyline, a final insult.

The corporate monumentality of Pei’s architecture is revealed in clips from movies including Woody Allen’s Sleeper and Paul Verhoeven’s RoboCop, shot in the National Centre for Atmospheric Research and around Dallas City Hall respectively. But his late work softened some of that steely smoothness. Pei often said (including in a 2010 interview with the FT) that he was a western architect, but that the Chinese in him had somehow survived.

In the last decade of his life, he acknowledged Asian and historic precedents more directly. In his Western New pavilion for the Suzhou Museum in China (2006) and in the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha (2008) he referred to historic forms and drew on memories of his childhood in a Suzhou summer house and its traditional garden. The show’s curators suggest that this garden was an ever-present motif for Pei’s conception of architecture: cool, controlled yet capable of delivering a surprise around each corner.

Pei himself was loath to grant permission for an exhibition in his lifetime; this is the first, five years after his death. If the architect has not accrued quite the same prestige or cult status as rivals such as Mies van der Rohe, Oscar Niemeyer or Louis Kahn, it is perhaps partly because he lacked a body of theory. As well as there being limited drawings, there are only a smattering of letters, interviews and brief explanatory texts on display here. For him the building should stand on its own, without a barrage of justification or spurious theoretical underpinning.

That slight absence of reflection makes it doubly striking to encounter a short film of him in the very last room, sitting in his impeccable suit beneath a big tree being asked how he feels about his buildings. He grins perhaps a little too broadly and replies, with an anxious laugh, “Mixed feelings”.",A man stands in front of a modern building with a distinctive curved white structure and a black tower.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6B7E7DBF10>,2024-08-12 04:00:53.352000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/e9eb3198-694c-425e-9499-a3e3f9825c26,['Entertainment' 'Local/Regional'],[0.85 0.75],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/188c8526d3.png
f20e7a8fd6,CNN,Democrats see Tuesday as make-or-break day for Biden’s political future - CNN,"After President Joe Biden’s reelection efforts spiraled into chaos following his debate fiasco last month, Democrats who have both stood by and abandoned Biden since then see Tuesday as a decisive day for the president’s political future.

Numerous Democrats inside Biden’s administration and others close to the White House and campaign have told CNN over the past few days that the conclusions drawn within a morning House Democratic caucus meeting – followed by a Senate Democrats’ gathering in the afternoon – will likely seal the president’s fate.

While Biden has said the “Lord almighty” alone could drive him to abandon his campaign, top Democrats have said the decision ultimately lies with party leadership, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.

“Chuck and Hakeem are going to have to say, ‘The Congress is turning on you,’” one top Democrat told CNN on the only scenario that could convince Biden to abandon his candidacy. “That’s basically the bottom line.”

Schumer and Jeffries both publicly backed Biden on Monday after the president launched an offensive across airwaves, campaign calls and congressional caucus meetings to shore up support. But both leaders will face their entire caucuses, which have seen support erode from senior members of committees. The degree of that erosion could force Democrats’ hand to decide one way or another - especially once Democrats begin to worry that appearing on a ballot under Biden harms their own election chances.

Jeffries listened as he was confronted with concerns and frustrations from all factions of the caucus during House Democrats’ Tuesday meeting.

The open mic format, during which roughly 30 lawmakers spoke, was designed so Jeffries and his leadership team could hear directly from members during the group’s first in-person meeting since the presidential debate.

But instead of a united front, Democrats emerged from the meeting without consensus or a clear path forward.

While Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn, a staunch Biden ally, called the meeting “very positive,” another Democratic member in the meeting told CNN that there was a sense of “sadness” in the room from “talking about someone you love who is in obvious decline.”

Democrat Rep. Lloyd Doggett, the first sitting House Democrat to call on Biden to withdraw his candidacy, said that he expects more Democrats to join his ranks following the caucus meeting, the opposite of what most party leaders were hoping for.

“The debate cannot be unseen. The president has been running behind. We needed a surge. We got a setback. He is a great man who’s made a great contribution to the country, but he shouldn’t leave a legacy that endangers us that we surrender to a tyrant,” Doggett said, referring to former President Donald Trump.

Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton, another one of the six House Democrats to publicly call for Biden to step aside, said he shared how he got to his position in the closed-door meeting with his colleagues.

“Everyone was listening very carefully to a variety of positions in the room. And that’s exactly the kind of debate and discussion that we should be having as a party. This is what democracy is about,” Moulton said.

Even though a number of lawmakers expressed their support for Biden, the concerns stuck with many Democrats after the meeting.

“There’s a ton of concern,” Democratic Rep. Greg Landman told CNN. “(Biden’s) got a lot of work left to do.”

The first fractures in what had been Biden’s coalition of Democratic support appeared last Tuesday, five days after his faltering debate performance, when Doggett of Texas became the first member of Biden’s own party in Congress to ask that he step aside. He has since been joined by several more members of Congress – all in the House – though the most prominent members have either firmly entrenched themselves behind their candidate or avoided questions about whether he should continue.

Several Democratic governors who attended a meeting with Biden at the White House last week left unimpressed with Biden’s shifting explanations for his poor debate performance and his vows to take steps, including limiting late-night events and going to sleep earlier, to avoid a repeat of that performance. One governor, Maura Healey of Massachusetts, said Biden should “carefully evaluate” whether he’s the best choice to defeat Trump.

Party officials tell CNN that a decision must happen soon, otherwise Biden’s candidacy could be irreparably damaged by the intra-party war that has broken out and the reputational damage Biden has sustained as a result.

“I can’t stress this enough: Dems need to make a decision and then move forward,” one DNC official said. “The sniping won’t stop until leadership officially puts an end to the uncertainty.”

That time crunch is part of what makes this week one of the most crucial of Biden’s half-century-long political career. House Democrats gathered on Tuesday to discuss steps forward with Biden’s campaign.

Biden will join a group of Democratic mayors for a meeting later Tuesday, and will participate in a rare solo news conference during the NATO summit later this week.

With the Democrats’ August convention quickly approaching, the party has little time to mount an entirely separate national political campaign in Biden’s absence - while the president has precious few opportunities to convince voters, donors and members of his own party that he is up to another grueling three months of campaigning followed by another four years in office.

The interview Biden did with ABC last week confirmed Biden’s stubborn determination to prove his doubters wrong and stay in the race - even if it didn’t soothe concerns about his ability to do so. He riffed extensively on polling data and, when asked whether he would consider stepping aside if crucial party leaders asked him to do so, replied: “They’re not going to do that.”

Another senior Democrat put the message more bluntly: Leaders in both chambers, they said, need to tell their members Tuesday to “f–king get in line.”

Most within the party understand the frustration that has emerged after Biden’s debate performance resurfaced questions about his health and longevity that even former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi described as “legitimate.”

But there remains a significant amount of skepticism that Biden could be replaced seamlessly on the ticket without more hand-wringing and a lot of red tape.

“The fantasy that we could swap in a person, and they could run away with a nomination at the convention, is just that – a fantasy,” another senior Democrat said. “And the chattering in the interim isn’t helping.”

9904a077c9,Financial Times,AMD signs $4.9bn deal to challenge Nvidia’s AI infrastructure lead - Financial Times,"AMD has agreed to buy artificial intelligence infrastructure group ZT Systems in a $4.9bn cash and stock transaction, extending a run of AI investments by the chip company as it seeks to challenge market leader Nvidia.

The California-based group said the acquisition would help accelerate the adoption of its Instinct line of AI data centre chips, which compete with Nvidia’s popular graphics processing units (GPUs).

ZT Systems, a private company founded three decades ago, builds custom computing infrastructure for the biggest AI “hyperscalers”. While the company does not disclose its customers, the hyperscalers include the likes of Microsoft, Meta and Amazon.

The deal marks AMD’s biggest acquisition since it bought Xilinx for $35bn in 2022.

“It brings a thousand world-class design engineers into our team, it allows us to develop silicon and systems in parallel and, most importantly, get the newest AI infrastructure up and running in data centres as fast as possible,” AMD’s chief executive Lisa Su told the Financial Times.

“It really helps us deploy our technology much faster because this is what our customers are telling us [they need],” Su added.

The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to regulatory approval, after which New Jersey-based ZT Systems will be folded into AMD’s data centre business group. The $4.9bn valuation includes up to $400mn contingent on “certain post-closing milestones”.

Citi and Latham & Watkins are advising AMD, while ZT Systems has retained Goldman Sachs and Paul, Weiss.

The move comes as AMD seeks to break Nvidia’s stranglehold on the AI data centre chip market, which earlier this year saw Nvidia temporarily become the world’s most valuable company as big tech companies pour billions of dollars into its chips to train and deploy powerful new AI models.

Part of Nvidia’s success stems from its “systems” approach to the AI chip market, offering end-to-end computing infrastructure that includes pre-packaged server racks, networking equipment and software tools to make it easier for developers to build AI applications on its chips.

AMD’s acquisition shows the chipmaker building out its own “systems” offering. The company rolled out its MI300 line of AI chips last year, and says it will launch its next-generation MI350 chip in 2025 to compete with Nvidia’s new Blackwell line of GPUs.

In May, Microsoft was one of the first AI hyperscalers to adopt the MI300, building it into its Azure cloud platform to run AI models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4. AMD’s quarterly revenue for the chips surpassed $1bn for the first time in the three months to June 30.

But while AMD has feted the MI300 as its fastest-ever product ramp, its data centre revenue still represented a fraction of the $22.6bn that Nvidia’s data centre business raked in for the quarter to the end of April.

In March, ZT Systems announced a partnership with Nvidia to build custom AI infrastructure using its Blackwell chips. “I think we certainly believe ZT as part of AMD will significantly accelerate the adoption of AMD AI solutions,” Su said, but “we have customer commitments and we are certainly going to honour those”.

Su added that she expected regulators’ review of the deal to focus on the US and Europe.

In addition to increasing its research and development spending, AMD says it has invested more than $1bn over the past year to expand its AI hardware and software ecosystem.","An individual stands on a stage with a large screen displaying 'AMD Instinct™ MI300X Leadership generative AI accelerator' and other technical specifications like '192 GB HBM3', '5.2 TB Memory Bandwidth', and '896 GB/s Infinity Fabric™ Bandwidth'.

f3032fe545,The Associated Press,Here's how to watch Biden's news conference as he tries to quiet doubts after his poor debate - The Associated Press,"President Joe Biden will hold a news conference Thursday, the key event in a monumental week during which the Democratic incumbent is fending off calls for him to step aside as the party’s presumptive nominee following a shaky debate performance.

It’s just the type of event that many political watchers have said Biden needs to pull off successfully to turn back demands — including from within his own party — that he withdraw from his reelection battle against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.

Biden has argued that he had a singularly bad night in Atlanta and that it wasn’t representative of his mental acuity. A strong performance Thursday could convince members of his party that he still has the ability both to win in November and to serve a second term. A weak effort — or stumbles similar to his debate performances — could make the calls for him to withdraw grow much louder.

Here are the details on what White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has referenced as Biden’s “big boy” news conference:

When is the news conference?

Biden is scheduled to take questions from the White House press corps no earlier than 7 p.m. ET Thursday. It had initially been slated for 5:30 p.m. and could begin even later than 7 p.m., depending on how events at NATO move along.

Where is Biden speaking?

Biden will be speaking from the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, a short distance from the White House, where many events of the ongoing NATO summit are being held.

What channel is carrying it?

The White House streams much of its live content. Given the attention on this event, television networks could also break away from programming to carry Biden’s remarks live once he starts speaking.

The Associated Press will offer a livestream at apnews.com.

Who will be watching?

Probably a lot of people.

CNN reported that 51 million people watched the Atlanta debate, which was in primetime, while more than 8 million people tuned in to watch Biden’s ABC interview live. If networks break into their daily coverage or cable channels carry it live, that will guarantee a significant number of eyes on Biden.

Will Biden know the questions ahead of time?

Aside from some apparent exceptions — like incidents in which two radio hosts said Biden’s campaign sent them planned questions ahead of time — it’s not standard practice for the president to know precisely what will come up during interviews or news conferences.

His aides prepare him for a host of possibilities based off the headlines of the day, so they’re prepping him for the likelihood that journalists will want to ask about his fitness for office, the NATO summit or other topics.

How many questions will he take?

That’s not set in stone, and there’s not a ton of precedent.

Biden hasn’t held very many news conferences that aren’t tied to a foreign leader’s visit or trips abroad. Typically, those are what’s known in the business as a “2+2,” meaning two reporters from the U.S. and two foreign reporters ask questions.

What’s up next?

Biden returns to the campaign trail with a trip to Michigan Friday. He will also do an interview with NBC on Monday.

c09dd4f07d,Newsmax,'Justice for Jocelyn Act' Would Toughen Migrant Detention - Newsmax,"Family members of a 12-year-old Houston girl who police say was killed by two Venezuelan men who entered the U.S. illegally said Friday that they are supporting legislation that would severely limit the ability of federal immigration authorities to release immigrants they detain.

The proposed legislation runs counter to what migrants' rights groups advocate — a move away from detention — with one such advocate calling the measure an effort ""to bloat the immigration enforcement system"" and ""to demonize immigrant communities.""

Venezuelan nationals Johan Jose Martinez-Rangel, 22, and Franklin Jose Peña Ramos, 26, have been charged with capital murder in the death of Jocelyn Nungaray, whose body was found in a creek June 17 after she disappeared during a walk to a convenience store. A medical examiner concluded that she was strangled.

The two men entered the United States illegally earlier this year on separate occasions near El Paso, Texas. They were arrested by the U.S. Border Patrol but later released with orders to appear in court at a later date, according to the U.S. Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.

Their release came through ICE’s Alternatives to Detention programs, which allow detained immigrants to be freed while their immigration cases are pending. ICE uses GPS monitoring, phone calls, and a phone app to monitor them and ensure they make their court appearances.

""The two men who ripped my daughter away from me should have never been here. They should never have been roaming our streets freely, as freely as they were,"" Alexis Nungaray, Jocelyn Nungaray's mother, said at a news conference.

Following the girl's death, Sen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Troy Nehls, both Republicans from Texas, introduced legislation called the ""Justice for Jocelyn Act."" It would prevent federal authorities from releasing a detained immigrant if there are open beds available at a detention center.

If detained immigrants are released, they would be subject to continuous GPS monitoring and have a nightly curfew, and any violation of the terms of their release would result in immediate deportation.

""These are crimes committed by illegal immigrants who were apprehended and that the Biden-Harris administration chose to release,"" Cruz said.

Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg, a Democrat, said she supports the legislation because ""it will make us safer and because crime is bigger than partisanship.""

Republicans have used recent cases of immigrants who entered the country illegally and were charged with crimes to attack what they say are President Joe Biden's failed immigration policies.

In Georgia, the arrest of a Venezuelan man accused of killing nursing student Laken Hope Riley became a flashpoint in the national debate over immigration. The suspect, Jose Ibarra, appeared in court Friday as his attorneys have asked his case be moved to another county.

Nayna Gupta, director of policy for the Chicago-based National Immigrant Justice Center, said the proposed legislation is ""seeking to exploit ... an awful situation.""

Gupta said it would eliminate the limited due process that detained immigrants have to make the case that they are not a danger and should not be held in a ""detention system where deaths, abuse, and medical neglect are really increasing with alarming frequency."" The bill's mandatory GPS monitoring would be a ""huge expansion"" of ICE's surveillance system, Gupta added.

""This bill is just an attempt to bloat the immigration enforcement system in a politicized manner by fearmongering and using a tragic incident, again, to demonize immigrant communities,"" she said.

A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on its Alternatives to Detention programs, which have been in place since 2004.

On its website, ICE says participants are thoroughly vetted and immigration officers review several factors, including criminal and supervision history and family and community ties.

Migrants' rights groups have urged federal authorities to rely less on detention, saying it is inefficient and ineffective and alternatives are more humane and cost-effective.

Many studies have found that immigrants are less drawn to violent crime than native-born citizens.

""Does our immigration system need to be fixed? Yes. But not because of these individual crimes. It needs to be fixed because it's been broken and outdated now for decades,"" Gupta said.","A woman stands at a podium with a microphone, behind her a sign reads 'Justice For Jocelyn' and a man stands to her right.

6cbd4b3eac,The Guardian US,"Trump’s return to rally stage met with prayers, excitement and confusion over JD Vance - The Guardian US","“He was spared by the hand of God!” a man wrapped in a flag chanted as he walked past a line of people snaking outside the 12,000-seat Van Andel Arena in downtown Grand Rapids, Michigan.

The display prompted a smattering of loud cries of “USA! USA!” but the general tone of the packed-in crowd who had gathered to see Donald Trump’s first rally since a would-be assassin opened fire on him at a campaign event in Pennsylvania a week ago was more laid-back.

Indeed, despite the roiling impact of the shooting on US politics over the past week, it felt like back to business-as-usual for the Trump campaign road show.

Joe Attard, a worker at a factory that makes sheds, made the drive from Southgate, Michigan, to Grand Rapids hoping to catch a glimpse of Trump, who was appearing in the crucial battleground state after being formally anointed as the Republican presidential candidate and hitting the campaign trail with his new running mate, the Ohio senator JD Vance.

“There’s a real feeling of community here, everybody in the same mind,” Attard said. “It’s a great feeling.” Other than a lone man across the barricades holding a “Deport Trump” sign, Attard seemed to be right. There were few people around without some kind of Trump-branded apparel.

Perhaps in keeping with a party that has fully unified around Trump after the shocking attempt on his life, most people seemed excited to be at the rally. A man in an army baseball cap pointed people towards the ADA-accessible line. People waved and cheered for the Secret Service officers and mounted police patrolling the street.

Standing in line, Isaiah White, a 25-year-old from Hudsonville, Michigan, said he was “very excited” for another chance to see Trump. The last time Trump came to Van Andel Arena, White got in line too late and had to watch on the Jumbotron outside the venue.

Betsy Gatchell Goff, who came to Van Andel Arena from her home town of Benton Harbor, Michigan, said she thought Trump was “a unifying figure for our country”. Gatchell Goff hoped that with Trump back in office, “we’ll have a president who does more than sleep all day”, a disparaging reference to Joe Biden.

But there was also a strain of bitter sentiment among the crowd. “Trump won” and “Unvaxxed and Proud” were two of the most common slogans on T-shirts, hats and flags.

The mood around last Saturday’s assassination attempt was surprisingly nonchalant among attendees. Indeed, as has happened with Trump’s campaign, the imagery and fact of the attack had been exploited for gain. A vendor on the corner sold shirts sporting a bloodstained Trump, fist raised, with the caption: “Missed me, motherfucker.”

Attard was glad to see Trump back on the campaign trail so soon after an attempt on his life. “It shows the world that he’s strong,” Attard said.

Among the elected officials present, the tone was more reverent. As the event opener, a local Michigan representative gave a prayer that thanked God for “graciously sparing President Trump”.

Security, on the other hand, was fully alert. Secret Service and TSA agents, including at least one K-9 unit, motioned people through metal detectors, while legions of staffers in crisp polos emblazoned with “Team Trump” ushered people to their seats.

There was serious political red meat from some speakers. The Michigan Republican party chair, Pete Hoekstra, took the stage to open the event and called Governor Gretchen Whitmer the “worst governor in the United States”. Anti-Whitmer sentiment was widespread, with people throughout the event calling her “Witless”, “Witchmer” or “Whitler”.

The state of Michigan politics was a prominent theme. Bill Huizenga, the US representative for Michigan’s fourth district, said Trump was in Grand Rapids to show the world how “the blue wall” of midwestern states was “going to crumble like a cookie”.

The Grand Rapids rally was the first since JD Vance was announced as Trump’s running mate. The Ohio senator seemed to be a bit of an unknown quantity among rally attendees.

“I’ll support him because Trump supports him,” Betsy Gatchell Goff said. Isaiah White admitted: “Honestly, I had to Wikipedia him, but he seems all right.”

The tone shifted once Vance appeared. The new vice-presidential candidate opened with a joke about the Ohio-Michigan football rivalry and followed it up with challenging Vice-President Kamala Harris’s record, saying: “What the hell have you got?,” prompting the loudest cheers of the afternoon.

But much of the tone was the usual politics-as-entertainment fare that is a hallmark of Trump rallies. Even in the wake of an attempted assassination, Trump’s rally struck a celebratory tone in this extraordinary American election.

As the crowd filtered in, Macho Man by the Village People and Born Free by Kid Rock alternated with La Vie enRose by Édith Piaf. A sizzle reel from the Trump campaign lit up the arena, then launched straight into a dramatized victimhood narrative.

“The only crime I’ve committed is to fiercely defend this country,” Trump’s voice boomed in the accompanying voiceover. At the line: “When I’m re-elected, I will obliterate the deep state!,” the crowd erupted into cheers and whistles. In a later promotional video, a union worker said: “Fuck you” to a reporter when asked about Joe Biden’s policies.

At this, people throughout the crowd broke into laughter.","A crowd of people at a sporting event, with one person taking a photo, some wearing patriotic clothing and accessories, and a large American flag in the background.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BA3CA60E0>,2024-07-20 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/20/trump-vance-michigan-rally,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/6cbd4b3eac.png
66f4c25b7a,USA TODAY,Wounded Knee Medals of Honor come under scrutiny as massacre is revisited - USA TODAY,"WASHINGTON – The Pentagon has launched a review that could revoke 20 Medals of Honor awarded to soldiers involved in the Wounded Knee Massacre of 1890, marking the military’s latest effort to acknowledge that some medal recipients and memorials don’t measure up to standards of valor and honor.

Since 2020, after the murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis, the military has increasingly sought to reckon with vestiges of racism. It has erased the names of treasonous Confederate officers from some of its most iconic bases.

Now, the Pentagon is poised to strip the nation’s highest award for valor from soldiers who slaughtered Native American noncombatants, including women and children at Wounded Knee Creek.

Those actions come as the military increasingly diversifies. More than 40% of troops identify as people of color, according to the Pentagon.

On July 19, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the review by five experts to examine the actions of 20 soldiers involved in the fighting at Wounded Knee Creek, South Dakota, on Dec. 29, 1890. Austin directed the panel to present him with recommendations by Oct. 15 on each medal awarded.

Austin’s order comes more than three decades after the U.S. Senate declared the battle to be a massacre. The Army killed as many as 375 Native American men, women and children, according to a 1990 Senate resolution. The review follows more recent attempts in Congress that have failed to garner enough support to force the military to account for Medals of Honor issued at Wounded Knee.

Austin’s order is especially significant in part because the Medal of Honor has become imbued over the years with a reverence bordering on the sacred, according to a senior Defense official who was not authorized to speak publicly.

“The Medal of Honor is much more than being in combat and doing well,” the official said. “The Medal of Honor goes to those who decide to do much, much more than fight. They display honor, gallantry – a word we don’t use every day. There’s a case to be made that there was no honor present at Wounded Knee that day. That’s why we need this review.”

What happened at Wounded Knee Creek

In 1890, a government Indian Affairs agent misinterpreted a Lakota Sioux religious revival ceremony known as a “Ghost Dance” as a call for insurrection, according to a 2024 University of Oklahoma College of Law paper by Dwight Mears, an Army combat veteran and former professor at West Point.

President Benjamin Harrison ordered the Army to prevent an uprising in South Dakota. The 7th Cavalry arrived at Wounded Knee Creek and sought to disarm the Lakota. A gun discharged during that attempt followed by bitter fighting.

The battle shifted to a ravine. It ended when soldiers fired cannons at Native Americans seeking shelter.

Allegations of noncombatant deaths soon emerged. Maj. Gen. Nelson Miles relieved the 7th Cavalry commander and ordered an investigation. Miles wrote to his superiors and expressed his “strongest disapproval” over the killing of noncombatants.

In a private letter Miles wrote, “I have never heard of a more brutal, cold-blooded massacre than that at Wounded Knee.”

Mears cited the Army’s latest historical account of the day. The first shot fired might have been an accident, the result of a soldier trying to disarm a Lakota. “But whatever the source, it led to indiscriminate firing from soldiers and some return fire from the Lakota. In the ensuing action, many Lakota men, women and children sought to escape via ravines that cut through the area. The soldiers also employed artillery despite the presence of numerous noncombatants.”

When it was over, as many as 300 Lakota had been killed, including women and children, according to Army historians. There were 25 soldiers killed, some likely by friendly fire.

The Wounded Knee site became a place of remembrance for Native Americans, and the massacre a rallying cry in struggles for Native American rights, according to the Library of Congress.

Why Medals of Honor were awarded

At the time, the Medal of Honor was the only medal available to award to soldiers. It would be decades before other medals such as the Distinguished Service Cross, Silver Star and Bronze Star were awarded.

The guidelines for awarding the medal had evolved from the Civil War when it was established and required soldiers to have faced combat.

By 1916, Congress intervened to establish standards for the Medal of Honor and authorized a board to consider revoking medals from recipients who didn’t measure up. That review resulted in more than 900 Medals of Honor being rescinded. Most of those taken back had been awarded during the Civil War to soldiers who had reenlisted.

What the Pentagon review is trying to accomplish

Austin ordered the panel to look at each soldier’s actions during the engagement at Wounded Knee, according to the memo establishing the review. He tasked the Army with producing each soldier’s personnel file, and reports and investigations into the actions during the battle. The panel will consider the standards that applied when the medal was issued and recommend revocation of medals for soldier who didn't qualify. At the time, Army regulations required soldiers to avoid civilian casualties when possible.

Austin identified “disqualifying actions” that would revoke a medal, including intentionally attacking civilians, murder and rape.

Some of the Medal of Honor recipients at Wounded Knee also appear to have failed to meet the requirements of valor of their day, according to Mears. Mears found that two soldiers might have their medals revoked because their actions, while not criminal, failed to meet the standard of distinguished conduct. One of them, Pvt. Matthew Hamilton, was awarded the Medal of Honor for “rounding up and bringing to the skirmish line a stampeded pack mule.”

If a soldier did act honorably at Wounded Knee, rendering medical aid under fire, for instance, he should be allowed to retain his medal, the senior Defense official said. But any dishonorable action should result in revocation, the official said.

“This is tied up in the military’s review of renaming bases and the placement of statues celebrating the Confederacy,” the official said. “Some will view it as trying to rewrite history or being woke. In this case, that’s not a valid concern. Ultimately, nobody can view actions at Wounded Knee as something to be proud of. No reading of history, no historical contextualization, can rationalize actions on that day.”","A black and white photo of four men on horseback, with one man pointing towards the camera, in a desert-like setting.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BCAEE6D70>,2024-08-01 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.usatoday.com,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/08/01/wounded-knee-medal-of-honor-recipients-questioned/74618864007/,['Politics' 'National'],[0.85 0.8 ],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/66f4c25b7a.png
7db5a27eb0,Newsmax,1 Dead in Wildfires Spreading in West - Newsmax,"A person was killed in one of several wildfires threatening heavily populated areas of the Colorado foothills, authorities said Wednesday, as almost 100 large blazes burned across the western U.S.

The death came in a fire near the town of Lyons that blackened more than two square miles by Wednesday afternoon, authorities said. The person's remains were discovered in one of five homes that burned, Boulder County Sheriff Curtis Johnson said without providing further details.

Though listed as zero percent contained, the Stone Canyon Fire was not growing significantly Wednesday as 150 firefighters battled the flames, Johnson said. It was one of several large fires burning along Colorado's Front Range, a densely populated corridor that includes Denver and stretches roughly 80 miles along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains.

A fire at the edge of the Denver metro area west of the small town of Conifer triggered evacuation orders for about 575 houses from several subdivisions overnight Tuesday. That fire was less than one square mile (2.5 square kilometers) as of midday Wednesday but was expected to grow with temperatures forecast to reach nearly 100 degrees.

A plane was dropping fire retardant and four helicopters were dropping water from a nearby reservoir on that fire. It was burning in steep terrain, making it hard to combat from the ground, said Mark Techmeyer with the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office.

""This fire is not an easy fight. The terrain is treacherous,"" he said.

A third large fire burned more than 10 square miles west of the town of Loveland, where 4,000 people remained under evacuation orders.

Loveland-area resident Becca Walter said her parents, who also live in the area, sent her a photo of flames climbing a nearby ridge Wednesday morning. They moved their eight horses to a friend's ranch before evacuating to Walter's house. She worried her parent's house could be lost.

""You can rebuild a house, and you can rebuild a barn, but there are lot of memories in them that you can't rebuild,"" she said.

Yet another fire ignited Wednesday afternoon and prompted evacuation orders southwest of Boulder in the Gross Reservoir area. Two structures burned — at least one of them a house — and two firefighters suffered unspecified injuries, officials aid.

The fire was human-caused and authorities were talking to two people who may have been involved, Sheriff Johnson said, adding it did not appear intentional. The fire was held to about five acres by Wednesday evening, he said.

Hot, dry weather and wind gusts of up to 30 mph were expected Wednesday across the Front Range, elevating the fire danger. Forecasters said the high temperatures were expected to persist into early next week but lighter winds in coming days could make it easier to control the blazes.

Colorado National Guard units were activated to help, Gov. Jared Polis said during a news conference in Loveland. He said it's the first use of the guard in such fashion since a December 2021 fire killed two people and destroyed nearly 1,100 homes in heavily populated suburbs between Denver and Boulder.

Under the haze of wildfire smoke, Polis warned of air quality ""taking a turn for the worst"" with the fire near Loveland expected to burn for weeks or months.

While most people heeded evacuation orders, some have refused, Polis said. He urged them to consider a few nights away from home over the possibility of losing their lives.

A plane involved in the Stone Canyon Fire inadvertently dropped fire-retardant slurry containing phosphorous and ammonia-based ingredients into a water canal leading to Boulder Reservoir on Tuesday, city officials said. Although the reservoir is not being used for drinking water, officials advised against fishing there and urged people to keep their dogs out of the waters.

A federal judge ruled last year that the U.S. government was violating pollution laws by dropping retardant into areas with waterways. But the judge allowed the practice to continue after officials said lives and property were at stake.

Across the U.S. almost 28,000 firefighters were battling 95 large fires, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.

Almost 7,000 square miles have burned nationwide so far this year, an area nearly the size of New Jersey and well above the 10-year average for this time of year.

Evacuation orders were in effect for more than two dozen fires.

Fires in southeastern Wyoming triggered evacuations in Hartville, with about 65 people, and unincorporated Pleasant Valley. Helicopters and heavy tankers were deployed against the fires, which had grown to about 47 square miles by Wednesday morning, Gov. Mark Gordon said.

In Northern California, the massive Park Fire has scorched 609 square miles, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The blaze started in Butte County last week after authorities say a man pushed a burning car down a ravine. Flames destroyed 361 structures and threaten thousands more.

Fire officials hoped to take advantage of milder weather ahead of triple-digit temperatures forecast for Thursday through next week.

""We're going into the heart of the fire season starting in August. We've got a long road ahead of us,"" Billy See, a Cal Fire incident commander for the Park Fire, told firefighting crews.

In Southern California, firefighters made progress on fires in the Sequoia National Forest that led to evacuations. One scorched through almost the entirety of the historic mining town of Havilah.

Fires statewide have overwhelmed California's firefighting capacity but outside help has begun to arrive, officials said.

Large fires also were burning in Oregon, Idaho, Washington and Montana.","A large plume of smoke rises over a mountainous landscape, with a clear sky above and a few scattered trees visible.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x186 at 0x7D6BCB90F5E0>,2024-07-31 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.newsmax.com,https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/wildfires-fatality-colorado/2024/07/31/id/1174770/,['Weather and Environment' 'Local/Regional'],[0.95 0.85],Unlikely,Likely,sample_review/images/7db5a27eb0.png
50b1ec4e06,CNN,Uganda’s President Museveni warns citizens they are ‘playing with fire’ over planned protests - CNN,"Uganda’s hardline President Yoweri Museveni has warned citizens planning anti-corruption protests Tuesday that they are “playing with fire.”

The upcoming protests come after a wave of deadly anti-government demonstrations that rattled neighboring country Kenya where at least 50 people were killed in clashes with security forces, according to figures released by the National Commission on Human Rights.

Museveni, 79, who has ruled the East African nation with an iron fist for nearly four decades, said in a televised address on Saturday that the anti-corruption march will not be allowed.

“What right… do you have to seek to generate chaotic behavior? … We are busy producing … cheap food, other people in other parts of the world are starving… you here want to disturb us. You are playing with fire because we cannot allow you to disturb us…”, Museveni said in the three-hour-long wide-ranging address.

Many young Ugandans say on social media they plan to go ahead with the march to the country’s parliament despite the country’s police refusing to grant a permit for the protest.

The Uganda Police Force described the planned protests as “potentially anarchic” in a statement on Monday, warning it “shall not tolerate disorderly conduct.”

Some defiant youth protesters who plan to join the march on Tuesday have begun sharing their photos on social media, urging fellow citizens to remember them if they don’t make it home alive.

“Just in case I get abducted or I die in the march, you can use this (photo) for creating awareness. Otherwise, tell mum I played a fundamental role in saving my country! I know she will be happy!”, said one activist Ashiraf Hector on X.

Another wrote: “Tomorrow, very early in the morning, I will join my fellow young people as we march to parliament against escalating corruption in Uganda. We will come face to face with murderers and in case things go south for me, this is my official portrait.”

A group of lawyers and activists said in a letter on Sunday that the police could not, by law, stop peaceful protests.

“The police cannot prohibit a demonstration from proceeding but have powers to regulate it to ensure it takes place within confines of the law,” the letter said while urging President Museveni to “ensure that the constitutional right to assemble, demonstrate peacefully … is not violated with impunity by security agencies.”

Crackdown ahead of protests

Ugandan opposition leader Bobi Wine said on Monday he supported the protest which he clarified was “organized by the young people of Uganda” and not his NUP party.

Wine raised the alarm that his party’s secretariat had been cordoned off by security forces and some party leaders had been “violently arrested” ahead of the Tuesday march.

“The effort by the regime to clamp down and make it (the planned protest) look like an NUP initiative is meant to weaken it because they want to make it appear like a partisan matter,” he said in a statement on X.

Uganda grapples with widespread government corruption with an estimated Sh. 10 trillion ($2.7 billion) in public funding diverted each year, according to its anti-graft body, the Inspectorate of Government (IGG).

Last year, it scored 26 on Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index which ranks countries on a scale of zero to 100, with zero meaning “highly corrupt” and 100 signifying that a country is “very clean.”

“The thieves are parasites that must be stamped out,” Museveni said about his administration’s fight against graft last month, adding that his ruling NRM party “does not victimize anybody without proof (of corruption).”

“That is why some people think that the NRM is soft on corruption,” he said, stating that some corruption cases against public officials were being decided in court.

However, those agitating for a protest are unimpressed with the government’s handling of corruption, urging Ugandans to “#March2Parliament” on July 23 to “#StopCorruption.”’.

Some have also called for the speaker of the parliament, Anita Annet Among, to resign. She was among high-profile Ugandan politicians sanctioned by the United States and the United Kingdom for corruption earlier this year.

“Among is designated due to involvement in significant corruption tied to her leadership of Uganda’s Parliament,” according to the US State Department.

Among has pushed back against the sanctions, calling them “politically motivated” and claiming they were triggered by Uganda’s defiance of international pressure after passing a strict anti-LGBTQ law last year.","An older man in a military uniform with red and gold epaulettes gestures with his right hand, possibly addressing an audience.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BCBF4DFC0>,2024-07-22 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/22/africa/uganda-anti-corruption-protest-intl/index.html,['Politics' 'National' 'International'],[0.95 0.85 0.75],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/50b1ec4e06.png
a675cf7bd8,Global News Toronto,‘Rust’ trial: Live bullets also found in actor Jensen Ackles’ prop holster - Global News Toronto,"Jurors on Thursday heard testimony from a crime scene technician who alleged live bullets were found in several places on the Rust set, including inside a prop holster carried by actor Jensen Ackles.

As Alec Baldwin’s involuntary manslaughter trial continues in Santa Fe, N.M., technician Marissa Poppell said the live bullets inside the gun carried by Baldwin were not the only ones present on the western movie set.

Baldwin, 66, is on trial over the October 2021 on-set shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, who was killed by a bullet fired from Baldwin’s gun as he rehearsed in front of a camera. The shot discharged from the Colt .45 also injured Rust writer and director Joel Souza.

Poppell said live ammunition was discovered inside Baldwin’s gun, on a prop cart, in a box of ammo and in two separate bandoliers, one of which was worn by Ackles, 46. The second bandolier was worn by Baldwin.

The crime scene technician said she had no reason to believe Ackles knew the bullets in his costume bandolier were legitimate. He had, however, been carrying them in the holster while acting on set.

Baldwin’s defence lawyer Alex Spiro grilled Poppell over search warrants served on both a prop truck a week after the death of Hutchins and a prop warehouse more than a month after the shooting.

The questions eventually led to Spiro asking Poppell whether police and prosecutors “were just trying to get this over with so that prosecutors could focus on Alec Baldwin?”

Poppell said that was not the case.

Poppell said there was evidence Hannah Gutierrez-Reed — the film’s armourer who has already been convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the shooting — brought the live ammunition to set, which she said was given to her by her father.

Ackles, who is best known for his roles in Supernatural and The Boys, is no longer a Rust cast member. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Ackles left the production in 2023 due to scheduling conflicts. He was replaced by actor Josh Hopkins.

Ackles was, however, on set the day Hutchins was fatally shot. During a 2022 interview with USA Today, Ackles called the incident “a horrible, horrible accident.”

“You can chalk it up to negligence or try to point a finger at anybody,” he said. “At the end of the day, it was a horrible, horrible accident that ended with a life. Unfortunately, those do happen all the time around the world everywhere. You don’t normally witness them like I did, and it’s certainly shocking and jarring. It makes you value life even more than you had.”

Ackles said the Rust production had been only a week and a half out from finishing when Hutchins, who was doing “really exceptional” work, was killed.

“She was an incredible talent, and I wish there was some way to get it out there to the masses, but I don’t know that that’s possible,” he said of the film.

d9554a8367,The Guardian US,‘Keep the door open’: Nashville’s mayor on governing a blue island in a sea of red - The Guardian US,"Tennessee’s legislative session concluded in late April with some laws that alarm liberals, such as a bill to arm teachers and school staff. But the relatively progressive city of Nashville emerged largely unscathed by the GOP-dominated legislature.

In fact, Nashville’s legislative fortunes improved markedly this term, with approval for a massive redevelopment project, created at the behest of the mayor, Freddie O’Connell, to accompany the construction of a new stadium for the Tennessee Titans across the river from the city’s tourist-friendly downtown.

Nashville is “the San Francisco of Tennessee” in some quarters of the state’s conservative commentariat. The red-state, blue-city dynamic has grown toxic at times. State legislators have sought to chastise Nashville’s leaders – consider the temporary expulsion of state representative Justin Jones after gun protests last year – and curtail the city’s authority. Legislators have sought to wrest control from Nashville’s convention center, its sports authority and its airport authority. They redrew congressional maps to take away its Democratic congressperson.

But this year, Nashville’s new mayor has been managing this relationship with better results.

Born and raised in Nashville, O’Connell is a software developer and former member of the Nashville metropolitan council who was elected the city’s mayor in 2022.

The Guardian spoke with O’Connell during the legislative session, discussing Nashville’s occasionally fraught relationship with conservative state leaders. That conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.

Do you sense hostility toward Nashville from the state government?

No! So that’s what’s interesting. This year, after sensing it strongly last year, I would say our administration and I personally have a sense of relief that the hostility toward the city has maybe subsided somewhat.

To what do you attribute this state of detente that you’re describing?

We’ve been working on it. I don’t want the city to be at war, right? We know there will be values and policy disagreements, not just between urban and rural parts of the state, but certainly among policymakers at various levels. There’s just no reason to then add to that a permanent posture of war and hostility. If we have a better relationship, these are the places where you can succeed. A lot of times that’s the fundamentals of governance: things like infrastructure and economic development. That’s where city and state succeed together most effectively. So we want to keep the door open to that.

Atlanta has had a string of mayors with widely varied relationships with the state of Georgia. The dynamic may be similar to Nashville and Tennessee: a state with a love-hate relationship with its largest city. Does that rhyme with what you’ve got going on?

I think it does, to some extent. I’ve said from the get-go that we’re going to defend the city from constitutional overreach in the places where it’s obvious. Our legal department has had a very good track record in defending us in those moments. But this goes to exactly what I’m talking about: we did not stun the state with a lawsuit over the sports authority after I took office. We picked up the phone and said, “We believe we see constitutional issues with this, and our legal department is going to file a suit.” And in that moment, we did two things at the same time: we followed our principles of no surprises and open communication, and we also followed our principles of existential right to exist.

The red state-blue city dynamic exists in a lot of southern states. New Orleans and Louisiana. Montgomery and Alabama. Look at Nashville, which was split up into three congressional districts.

That’s a big challenge for us when we don’t have a single member of Congress who lives in the city of Nashville right now.

So what does that do to Nashville?

Well, it’s a little soon to say. I guess the silver lining here is the community-level staff we’ve seen in the congressional offices has actually been fairly present and responsive. So that’s good.

But instead of having one easy place to send people for passport services or to talk about federal policy issues, you have to be a lot more mindful of … “wait a second, which district is this again?” I think we’re still waiting to see what it means in terms of the federal appropriations process. Are we going to be seeing partnerships and federal project dollars that come into the city of Nashville, versus trying to redirect those to only rural and exurban areas? We don’t know that part yet. But I think that’s a big concern.

Given that Nashville no longer has a Democratic congressperson representing its Democratic political majority, to what degree do you view yourself as a progressive leader in a state that is not politically progressive overall? Do you believe that you have a particular role to play in that regard?

I will say, I will spend my time in office trying to make progress for the people in Nashville in places we need progress most desperately. That really is in areas addressing cost of living and quality of life. We’ve seen the city grow tremendously, which on the one hand is exciting, but on the other hand is disruptive and expensive.

I would argue that it is very progressive to pursue ambitious transportation and transit. I guess it’s funny, I just learned a new phrase from a friend, who’s a former colleague on the metro council: “blue meat”. I think, maybe, there are people in our progressive ecosystem here in Nashville who would prefer that I throw out more pieces of blue meat.

But I feel like, especially in an executive role where our local government is, in fact, nonpartisan, my sense has been that we want to deliver high-quality city services. We want to make sure people have trust and confidence in local government. And that specifically lets us make the kinds of progress people need to drive down their cost of living to improve the quality of city services, to do the things that government is supposed to do.

You’re talking about the basics of governance, and not the big political conflicts like the abortion argument or gun rights or whatnot.

And here’s the thing: we need people in the partisan fray, and some people enjoy being in the partisan fray. We need to win elections to let us have an easier time defending Nashville’s interests and values. And that’s great, because the nice part is these things aren’t mutually exclusive. I’m here to be very serious about governing, and to try to create outcomes and make it easier to live in the city of Nashville, because we know a lot of people want to accomplish that goal. It’s Music City. It’s a great city. We want to keep it that way.

I love Nashville. This conversation is a privilege for me, in part because I get to tell the mayor of Nashville that I associate Nashville with the sound of wooooh! all the time. Because the last time I visited, I became keenly aware that this was the bachelorette capital of the universe, and every five minutes, I would hear 10 women off in the distance going wooooh! In my household, we can’t refer to Nashville without one or the other of us saying wooooh!

[Mildly rankled] Well, I will say it’s not the Nashville of my youth. In some ways, I hope that that limited view is not the Nashville of our future.

I think that’s actually where we’re trying to steer the conversation of the east bank. We’d like to develop something that is not a junior version of an entertainment district, but rather something that reflects the best practices of contemporary cities. Something that if you basically get to start from scratch, does it have the principles that will attract locals?

So less wooooh! and more, you know, workspace and coffee shops and neighborhood restaurants.

Right. Places for people to stroll along the Cumberland River, and the Tennessee Performing Arts Center. Fingers crossed, it will have a beautiful new home over there. And so, yes, the Titans will be playing football over there. But also, there will be all-ages experiences and people living there, which is critically important. Deeply affordable. Long-term affordable.

There is a contingent of conservative politicians who get elected by running against big cities, saying: “I am going to keep that liberal city in check.” Does that interfere with the kind of nuts-and-bolts economic development you’re talking about?

It could. And we’ll see. I think the state through the years used to respond pretty favorably toward the principles of economic development, but I do think it has come into vogue to run against Nashville, almost as if we were Tennessee’s San Francisco. Maybe that gets you points in a rural Republican primary?

It’s a different political environment nationally. And some of that, I think, does trickle downhill to the point where the attention economy says we have to make sure there’s an other out there somewhere. Sometimes I’ve got to be available to do myth-busting and dispel things you might see on Facebook or here at a county commission meeting that just have no reference in actual reality.

Do you have a good example of that?

I’ve been called comrade by people in Williamson county and Sumner county. It’s like, hey guys: you know we actually have a socialist on the metro council and it isn’t me.

There’s a Tucker Carlson-ization of conversation around urban politics and big cities: a general attack on urban America as unsafe and corrupt. It seems off to apply that to Nashville. Do you find yourself fending off attacks like this?

I don’t know that it’s an obligation, but it’s truly out there. I mean, you can look at Sumner county commission meetings.

If you watch those meetings, they’re absolutely decrying Nashville as just this absolutely absurd … it’s like a fantasia of the most ridiculous types of political rhetoric that are out there right now. And so, I find that being personally involved, being present … There’s value in seeing each other as people.

It’s really hard to get all worked up about somebody who’s standing in front of you and is not glowing with demonic energy.

The best example is I know is the governor. We are going to disagree on many things about our ideology and political outlook. But I’ve also known him long enough to know I absolutely have a respect for him, because just as I don’t spend my idle time throwing out a tremendous amount of blue meat, he doesn’t spend a lot of his time throwing red meat in that way. He doesn’t spend a lot of time jumping up and down on Nashville. I think that’s a meaningful distinction between some of the other governors we’ve seen around the country who have made that their thing. It’s like the hobby industry of politics is just to see how mean you can be to other people.

Do you see any additional pre-emptive threats coming your way?

There were bills that entered the discourse this year. I guess the sense of relief I have as the session comes to a close is that nothing materialized there that was specifically anti-Nashville.","A man in a tweed jacket and striped tie stands at a podium with a microphone, addressing an audience with a blue background and the 'The Guardian' logo visible.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BA2A0C490>,2024-05-08 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/08/nashville-mayor-freddie-oconnell-interview,['Politics' 'Local/Regional'],[0.95 0.9 ],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/d9554a8367.png
30d7112175,Reuters,"Exclusive: US to favor existing investors for Venezuela oil licenses, say sources - Reuters","HOUSTON/WASHINGTON, May 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. is preparing to prioritize issuing limited licenses to operate in Venezuela to companies with existing oil production and assets over those seeking to enter the sanctioned OPEC nation for the first time, two people close to the discussions said.

It will, however, avoid licensing firms with no prior investments in the country, putting a cap on how much revenue Venezuela could collect from its oil industry.

The U.S. Treasury Department last month said it would offer some individual authorizations to companies to operate in the South American nation after it did not renew a broad license that had eased oil and gas trade restrictions. The sanctions resumption came after the U.S. decided Venezuela had not fully met its promises to secure a competitive presidential election.

A Treasury spokesperson said the department would not comment on specific licenses as its evaluation process and criteria are not public.

Treasury ""generally relies on foreign policy guidance from the U.S. Department of State and take into consideration the national security interests of the United States,"" the spokesperson said. The State Department declined to comment.

PDVSA did not immediately comment.

OPTIMISM FADES

Venezuela's Oil Minister Pedro Tellechea had said the proposed U.S. authorizations would allow many foreign firms to expand joint ventures with PDVSA, while new partners could start fresh projects seeking capital.

But the limited U.S. exemptions under consideration will cut the opportunity for Caracas to use partners of PDVSA to expand the nation's crude production in the near term. Venezuela's oil exports climbed to about 900,000 barrels per day in March, before the U.S. decided not to renew the election-linked license.

Venezuela's Vice President Delcy Rodriguez on Tuesday slammed the impact of U.S. sanctions in the last five years, which she said have cut billions of dollars from Venezuela's GDP.

""It is an international embarrassment that in the 21st century ... the aim is to subjugate countries through the mechanism of economic sanctions,"" she said during a conference in Caracas.

President Nicolas Maduro could press for specific U.S. licenses for the oil and gas industries if he believes they are key to attracting new investment, or expanding cash-providing businesses, one of the people familiar with the matter said.

The guidance being prepared by Washington mainly will seek to help foreign companies recover pending debt and dividends in Venezuela, which in the last five years has affected many U.S., European and Asian firms.

The proposal would appear to exclude companies with no prior investment in Venezuela that have signed agreements with PDVSA to form new joint ventures, according to the people.

Late last year, PDVSA drafted a list of 17 potential joint ventures to be formed or expanded. The list included newcomers and long-time investors such as Repsol and Chevron.

Some U.S. and European companies have held exemptions to the sanction regime on Venezuela through so-called ""comfort letters"" issued by the State Department or specific licenses.

b75945366f,Bloomberg,India Port Workers Reach Pay Deal Averting Strike - Bloomberg,"The latest showdown between dockworkers in a major trading nation and their port employers appears to be ending without any significant disruptions.

Port employees’ unions in India agreed to a new five-year wage deal with government officials, averting a planned nationwide strike scheduled to start Wednesday, Bloomberg’s Rajesh Kumar Singh and Weilun Soon report today.

The new deal halts a walkout that could have involved nearly 20,000 workers and brought widespread disruption to cargo operations at some of the nation’s busiest ports. Unions at India’s 12 major state-run ports have been negotiating with the government since 2021 to try to increase pay.

Under the newly agreed terms, unions accepted an 8.5% wage increase over five years, backdated to Jan. 1, 2022, said Narendra Rao, a working committee member of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions.

P.M. Mohammed Haneef, president at All India Port and Dock Workers’ Federation, said management has agreed to conclude the proceedings of the wage negotiations panel within 15 days.

Earlier this year, labor disruptions at Germany’s biggest ports threatened to worsen shipping delays, and a French union called a series of strikes to protest government pension reforms, potentially slowing grain export terminals.

In March, Finland’s ports and rail networks faced strikes over labor market reforms. The following month, port workers in Chile staged protests that disrupted the loading and unloading of ships in one of the biggest exporters of raw materials from copper and lithium to pulp and fruit.

Perhaps the biggest potential problem with maritime labor is unfolding in the US, where talks between East and Gulf Coast dockworkers and their employers are at a stalemate, a little over a month before the current contract expires Sept. 30.

82d4791b89,The Atlantic,Why Some Narratives Are So Easy to Fall For - The Atlantic,"Who really benefits from remote work? Is it true that politicians have to be anti-immigration to win elections? Each episode of Good on Paper, the new podcast hosted by my colleague Jerusalem Demsas, delves into a misunderstood policy issue that deserves more nuanced analysis. I spoke with Jerusalem about how some narratives get lodged in the public’s mind and the dangers of stories that feel true but aren’t.

First, here are three new stories from The Atlantic:

A Way to Simplify

Stephanie Bai: Why do you think certain narratives can become so entrenched, even if the facts don’t support them? And why are other narratives more likely to fade?

Jerusalem Demsas: Narratives are a way of simplifying a really complicated world. Compelling ones follow story structures that we’re used to seeing: a villain and a hero, a bad developer versus a mother who’s struggling to get her kids through college. These kinds of narratives are compelling because there’s a spark of truth in them, which is that there are power struggles in the world; there are winners and losers. Many narratives stick because they reaffirm our own opinions and views, but that can be really dangerous: Just because something feels true doesn’t mean that it is.

The narratives that don’t stick are usually the ones that are more complicated. There isn’t always a clear-cut good guy and bad guy. Often we’re just existing in systems where a bunch of people act in their own self-interest; some of them are trying to do good, but people have different conceptions of what good is. Trying to describe a world full of that kind of complexity is not as satisfying.

Stephanie: In your recent story about maternal mortality, you talk about the doom-and-gloom framing that activists can use to spotlight issues. What are some of the counterproductive consequences of that approach that people might not expect?

Jerusalem: There’s this perception, which can be right in the short term, that if you say, “A bridge is going to collapse,” it’s going to get more attention than a report that says there are some structural deficiencies in America’s infrastructure.

But in the longer term, that first framing really erodes trust between the people who are trying to get attention for their cause and the people who are trying to triage different issues. Because at the end of the day, there are finite amounts of time and resources. Policy makers have to choose which problems to prioritize, meaning that something else will lose out. So if established organizations or journalists are constantly pushing out this narrative that everything’s on fire, it impedes policy makers from making any sort of ordering decisions. They might try to do everything at once or prioritize the wrong things, which can lead to chaos.

Stephanie: In your first episode, you discuss a study that found that senior women engineers at an unnamed Fortune 500 company were more productive when they worked remotely because they were spending less time on mentorship and giving feedback. But a prevailing narrative that took off during the pandemic is that women working from home are doubly burdened: They have to juggle child care and deal with the usual work responsibilities. As more research gets done on this topic, what are the next questions on your mind when it comes to how remote work affects women?

Jerusalem: When we ask, Is remote work working for women?, we’re also asking, Are they fulfilled? Is it true that remote work is making it possible for them to be more flexible, go pick their kids up from school, or hang out with their friends in their free time? Also, though it’s the case that mentorship is uncompensated by most employers, there’s a lot of connection that more experienced workers derive from that type of work. Some people have responded to my podcast saying that they miss that aspect of their work, even though they resented not being paid for it.

I think it’s really important to start from the question: What do we want work to do for people’s lives? Does that differ by industry?

Stephanie: What’s an idea or narrative that sounded good on paper to you but might not warrant a whole podcast episode?

Jerusalem: The idea that pass/fail classes are easy and not stressful. I took Mandarin pass/fail my senior year of college, thinking it would be a low-stakes way of learning a little bit of an important language. I ended up in the terrible middle space of devoting enough time to the class so as not to fail yet not devoting enough time to truly pick up a little Mandarin. What do I remember?

ad60235416,The New York Times,Democrats Lean on Abortion Rights Message for Anniversary of End of Roe - The New York Times,"Two years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, unleashing a cascade of state-level abortion bans and prompting an angry political backlash, Democrats are marking the anniversary by highlighting the role former President Donald J. Trump played in ending the constitutional right to an abortion.

Through advertising, campaign events and news conferences, Democrats at every level of the party are fanning out across the country, working to remind voters that it was justices nominated by Mr. Trump who helped overturn Roe v. Wade.

“Donald Trump is the sole person responsible for this nightmare,” President Biden said in a statement on Monday, also filming a video for social media. “My message to Americans is this: Kamala and I are fighting like hell to get your freedom back.”

The messaging push is unfolding during a tight presidential race, as Mr. Biden confronts weak approval ratings and the coalition that propelled his 2020 victory shows signs of fraying.

As they seek to reinvigorate their voters, Democrats are embracing variations of arguments that have fueled other victories in the past two years: that the Republican Party is ever more extreme and infringing, to an extraordinary degree, on some of the most personal health care decisions Americans can make.

“Donald Trump hand-picked three members of the United States Supreme Court because he intended for them to overturn Roe v. Wade — and as he intended, they did,” Vice President Kamala Harris said at a campaign event on Monday in College Park, Md. “In the case of the stealing of reproductive freedom from the women of America, Donald Trump is guilty.”

She was also expected to speak in Phoenix to “remind voters that Donald Trump is responsible for overturning Roe and the chaos that has followed,” and to “highlight the threat a second Trump presidency would pose to reproductive freedom nationwide,” according to the Biden campaign.

Her husband, Doug Emhoff, was headed to Flint and Clawson, Mich., with a similar message, and top Biden surrogates around the nation seized on the issue as they seek to frame the contrast in the election.

“It’ll be a binary choice on who’s going to restrict your rights,” Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, who is the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, said in an interview on Sunday. “This will just be a narrative of their extremism, but this one is baked in because it’s real. It’s not theoretical.”

Mr. Trump has said he is “proudly the person responsible” for overturning Roe v. Wade — a line Democrats are eager to highlight — and has suggested that, if elected, he would allow states to prosecute women who violate abortion restrictions. He has also said he believes abortion policy should be left to the states, disappointing some on the right.

“Some states will be more conservative and some will be more liberal,” Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, said in a statement, but Mr. Trump “supports the rights of individuals to determine their laws.”

“President Trump also strongly supports ensuring women have access to the care they need to create healthy families, including widespread access to IVF, birth control, and contraception, and he always will,” she added.

Democrats successfully deployed messaging around abortion rights in critical races during the 2022 midterm elections a few months after Roe was overturned and in a number of special elections since.

This year, campaigns including Mr. Biden’s are highlighting women’s personal experiences with abortion bans championed by Republicans.

On Monday, the Biden campaign released a television ad highlighting the experience of Kaitlyn Joshua, who said in the spot that when she had a miscarriage early in pregnancy, she was turned away from two Louisiana emergency rooms, “a direct result of Donald Trump overturning Roe v. Wade.”

An advocacy group started by Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois also announced a digital ad effort aimed at swing and independent women in Arizona, Florida and Nevada, highlighting the health risks facing pregnant women in the post-Roe era. The House Democratic campaign arm is running mobile billboards in five competitive districts, blaring positive comments that Republican incumbents made about the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health decision overturning Roe.

And major abortion rights groups are also mobilizing.

Planned Parenthood advocacy and political organizations said they planned to spend $40 million this election cycle. Planned Parenthood Federation of America also joined a coalition of other abortion rights and progressive groups, which plan to raise and spend $100 million to devise a federal strategy aimed at clawing back abortion rights.

In the two years since Roe fell, abortion rights organizations have focused on combating state-level restrictions in court and promoting ballot initiatives to enshrine abortion rights at the state level, along with engaging in key campaigns.

Democrats are also arguing that a second Trump administration would go further in restricting abortion rights and access by imposing sweeping new federal restrictions on the procedure.

Last week, Senator Tina Smith, a Democrat from Minnesota, introduced legislation that would repeal the Comstock Act, a Civil War-era statue that abortion rights supporters worry could be used to ban abortion medication — even in states where it remains legal.

Ms. Smith, a former Planned Parenthood executive, said the law offered a powerful argument for Democrats, underscoring the contrast between a second term for Mr. Biden or one for Mr. Trump.

“It’s such a clear choice on the issue of abortion rights,” she said. “Understanding how a future Trump administration could use the Comstock Act makes this a salient issue in our state too, where people might they think they are safe.”

Representative Pat Ryan, a Democrat running in a swing district in New York, said his party should explain Comstock as a “hidden ticking time bomb” for Mr. Trump. Mr. Ryan, who won his seat with an aggressive embrace of abortion rights, is encouraging his fellow Democrats to lean into Comstock and the future threats it may pose to abortion access.

But in this election, Americans are weighing a broad range of other considerations, too, and polls show that on a number of key issues — though not abortion policy — voters say that Mr. Trump would do a better job than Mr. Biden.","An older man in a dark suit stands at a podium with a microphone, gesturing with his right hand.

Following her performance, Gaga shared a note on Instagram about how ""completely grateful"" she was to perform at the opening ceremony.

She noted that she was ""humbled"" to perform ""a song to honor the French people and their tremendous history of art, music, and theatre.""

She continued, ""Although I am not a French artist, I have always felt a very special connection with French people and singing French music -- I wanted nothing more than to create a performance that would warm the heart of France, celebrate French art and music, and on such a momentous occasion remind everyone of one of the most magical cities on earth -- Paris.""

""To everyone in France, thank you so much for welcoming me to your country to sing in honor of you -- it's a gift I'll never forget!"" she added.

Dion closed the ceremony with a powerful performance of Edith Piaf’s famous song “Hymne á l’amour” at the Eiffel Tower after the Olympic Games were officially opened and the Olympic cauldron was lit in the Tuileries Garden.

It marked her first live performance since she announced her stiff-person syndrome diagnosis in December 2022. Following her diagnosis, the singer postponed -- and later canceled -- remaining dates on her Courage World Tour for 2023 and 2024.

Athletes gathered on boats for each national delegation and traveled down the river through the City of Lights. The parade came to an end in front of the Trocadéro, which offered a spectacular view of the Eiffel Tower.

Along with Gaga and Dion, French Malian singer Aya Nakamura delivered a performance of her songs ""Pookie"" and ""Djadja."" The orchestra of the French Republican Guard also performed Charles Aznavour's ""For Me Formidable"" and ""La Bohème.""

Another highlight included a group of 80 performers from the Moulin Rouge who performed the can-can. They were outfitted in pink costumes made for the opening ceremony, according to the Olympics X account. French heavy metal band Gojira and opera singer Marina Viotti also delivered an electrifying performance.

French mezzo-soprano Axelle Saint-Cirel sang the French national anthem while standing on the roof of the Grand Palais.

After all delegations were presented during the Parade of Nations, Juliette Armanet sang “Imagine” by John Lennon. Sofian Pamart accompanied Armanet on the piano.

LeBron James and Coco Gauff served as the Olympic flag-bearers for Team USA during the Parade of Nations.

The Paris Olympics come three years after the 2020 Olympics were held in Tokyo following a yearlong delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","A group of dancers in black outfits with pink feathered costumes are ascending a staircase with a 'PARIS' sign above them, set against a backdrop of greenery and a stone wall.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA3F7F190>,2024-07-26 21:43:00+00:00,https://abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/2024-paris-olympics-opening-ceremony-lady-gaga-performs/story?id=112305441,['Entertainment' 'International'],[0.9 0.7],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/ce1eda8325.png
492f4a263d,The Guardian,Dozens arrested in violent clashes across the country as government warns rioters ‘will pay the price’ | UK news - The Guardian,"Rioters will “pay the price” for the wave of violent clashes that has spread across the country, ministers warned on Saturday, after a day in which police battled rival groups of demonstrators in the worst outbreak of civil disorder in Britain for more than a decade.

Dozens of arrests were made after the scenes of disorder, with police warning that further violence is likely in the coming days.

Multiple towns and cities in England and Northern Ireland saw clashes between anti-immigration demonstrators and counter-protesters, with police officers attacked and injured, and many more arrests promised.

The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said the police would have the government’s full support to take the strongest possible action. “Criminal violence and disorder have no place on Britain’s streets,” she said.

“Anyone who gets involved in criminal disorder and violent thuggery on our streets will have to pay the price and they should expect there to be arrests, prosecutions, penalties and the full force of the law including imprisonment and travel bans. There are consequences for breaking the law.”

The widespread clashes pose the first big challenge to Keir Starmer’s new government, which is facing demands to introduce emergency powers to stop further violence and to recall parliament.

On Saturday bricks were hurled at police officers in Stoke-on-Trent, fireworks were thrown amid tense exchanges between an anti-Islamic group and an anti-racism rally in Belfast, and windows of a hotel which has been used to house migrants were smashed in Hull, where three police officers were injured and four people arrested. Later video footage on social media showed shops on fire. Several officers were also injured during “serious disorder” in Liverpool city centre, where bricks, bottles and a flare were thrown and two officers needed hospital treatment and six arrests were made. Greater Manchester police said a dispersal notice had been authorised for the city centre. Scuffles broke out as opposing groups faced each other in Nottingham’s Old Market Square with bottles and other items thrown from both sides.

About 150 people carrying St George’s Cross flags, shouting “you’re not English any more” and “paedo Muslims off our street”, were greatly outnumbered in Leeds by hundreds of counter-protesters shouting “Nazi scum off our streets”. Skirmishes broke out between demonstrators and punks – in town for a festival – in Blackpool, with bottles and chairs thrown.

In Bristol, police kept protesters and counter protesters apart before a group headed to a hotel used to house asylum seekers.

The need for urgent political intervention was stressed by the government’s independent adviser on political violence and disruption, Lord Walney, who told the Observer that new emergency powers may be needed. “The system isn’t set up to deal with this rolling rabble-rousing being fuelled by far-right actors,” he said.

“I think home office ministers may want to look urgently at a new emergency framework – perhaps temporary in nature – that enables police to use the full powers of arrest to prevent people gathering where there is clear intent to fuel violent disorder.”

Keir Starmer held a meeting of senior ministers on Saturday in which he said police had been given full support to tackle extremists who were attempting “to sow hate by intimidating communities”. He made clear that the right to freedom of expression and the violent scenes over recent days were “two very different things”.

Last week’s riots followed the killing of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport on Monday. Axel Rudakubana, 17, from Lancashire, is accused of the attack, but false claims were spread online that the suspect was an asylum seeker who had arrived in the UK by boat. In the wake of these messages, far-right protesters – guided by social media – gathered in cities across the country.

A key factor in this spread of online disinformation involved Elon Musk’s decision to allow rightwing activists such as Tommy Robinson back onto his social media platform X, said Joe Mulhall, director of research at Hope not Hate, the anti-fascism organisation. “The initial disinformation and anger was being perpetrated by individuals on Twitter, for example, that have been previously deplatformed,” he said. “And now they’ve been replatformed.”

Robinson was permanently banned from the platform (then called Twitter) in March 2018, then reinstated in November last year, after Musk bought it. “We hadn’t seen any significant numbers at any demonstrations since 2018,” Mulhall added.

An example of the danger posed by the misuse of social media was revealed in Stoke-on-Trent, where police were forced to deny there had been a stabbing, countering claims made on social media. “There is growing speculation that a stabbing has taken place as a result of the disorder today. We can confirm this information is false and no stabbings have been reported to police or emergency responders, despite videos fuelling speculation on social media,” police said.

The danger of such intervention was stressed by Ben-Julian “BJ” Harrington, the National Police Chiefs Council lead for public order, who condemned social media disinformation as a cause of last week’s disorder.

He said: “We had reports today that two people had been stabbed by Muslims in Stoke – it’s just not true. There’s people out there, not even in this country, circulating and stoking up hatred, division and concerns in communities that they don’t care about, don’t know and don’t understand.”

Harrington, who was also the NPCC’s gold commander in charge of national strategy for Saturday’s disorder, said that “yobs and thugs and criminals” were responsible. “This isn’t about protests,” he said. “This is about violent disorder. This is about people who are descending into communities and causing damage – throwing bricks and bottles and things at cops who work within those communities.”

Forces across England brought officers back from leave to deploy an extra 130 police support units – about 2,000 officers, he revealed. “Of course there is a limited number of officers, and every one that is taken from a community is not out there solving burglaries.”

Echoing concerns about the dangers of social media, shadow home secretary James Cleverly called for tech companies to be hauled into Downing Street to ensure they were acting to stop the spread of disinformation on their platforms. However, he was criticised for issuing a statement in which he said Starmer taking the knee had sent “completely the wrong message” to protesters, adding that there was “never a justification for disorder like this”.

There was also further condemnation of Nigel Farage’s role in inciting the violence with his comments about the Southport killings, in which he questioned “whether the truth is being withheld from us” after the attack on Monday. Robert Jenrick, one of the favourites in the Tory leadership race, said that the Reform leader’s comments did not “make the situation better”.

Last week’s clashes spread four days ago, when more than 100 protesters were arrested on Whitehall, where bottles and cans were thrown at police, while violence also broke out in Hartlepool and in Manchester.

On Thursday, Starmer announced a new “national” response to the disorder linking police forces across the country through shared intelligence and the expanded use of facial recognition.

Then, on Friday, about 500 people, including some parents with their children, gathered in Sunderland city centre, responding to far-right social media posts to turn up and demonstrate. The gathering quickly descended into violence, with masked boys and men throwing missiles, including bricks, stones, beer barrels and scaffolding poles, at riot police.

Ten people were arrested and four policemen taken to hospital, one seriously injured. A police station was ransacked and a Citizens Advice Bureau set alight. By Saturday morning, the acrid smell of fire still hung in the air. Shoppers stopped to express their shock at what had happened, with hundreds of residents of all ages gathering on the city’s streets with brushes, litter pickers, buckets, bin bags and dust pans.

The Sunderland Central Labour MP, Lewis Atkinson, said a link could be drawn between the disorder and the ashes of the English Defence League (EDL), which was founded by Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon. The EDL has disbanded but its supporters remain active, and Atkinson said evidence suggested a neo-Nazi offshoot of the group was involved in Friday’s violence.

A priest at Sunderland Minster said yobs tried to smash a gravestone to use as missiles during the disorder that gripped the city. “It’s an act of sacrilege to disturb someone’s gravestone,” said Rev Jacqui Tyson. “It’s also remarkably lacking in common sense – have you tried to pick up a gravestone?”","A police officer in riot gear is seen in the foreground, with a crowd of people in the background, some of whom are being arrested or detained.

c84bc6a7a4,The Guardian,‘Can we show an act of violence on TV?’ New thriller tells story of Munich hostage massacre - The Guardian,"The 1972 Munich Olympics were the first to be broadcast live by global satellite from continent to continent. As the first Games on German soil since Berlin 1936, organisers were keen to use the media to present a postwar liberal image to the world.

In the US, it was ABC sports that held the exclusive licence to broadcast the images. The sleepy crew were in the middle of a night shift, after Mark Spitz took home his seventh swimming gold of the Games, when gunshots rang out through the Olympic village, shortly after dawn.

The story of that production team, who had to suddenly switch from boxing and volleyball to live, 24-hour coverage of a hostage siege that ended with the death of 11 Israeli athletes is now being told in a newsroom thriller that premiered at Venice last week.

“The events of September 5 were streamed to 900 million people. It was the first time a terror attack reached a global audience during a live broadcast,” said Tim Fehlbaum, the Swiss director behind September 5.

“The ABC sports team were the only ones that had a live camera on the building where the hostages were being held. But they had no experience or training in reporting on crisis situations. These were people used to reporting on sports, that had to make the switch to geopolitical events. People who were suddenly confronted with the moral and ethical dilemmas, like can we show an act of violence on TV?”

The film is produced by Sean Penn and stars Peter Sarsgaard as Roone Arledge, the ABC executive in charge of broadcasting the games; Ben Chaplin as Marvin, the team’s head of operations; John Magaro as Geoff, a young and ambitious producer striving to prove himself to his boss; and Leonie Benesch as a local German translator.

It blends grainy archival footage from the day with behind-the-scenes dramatisations of the key players who fought to capture every twist and turn of the siege. And though the logistical difficulties they faced seems antiquated now – like having to smuggle 16mm film stock behind police cordons and communicating by walkie talkies – in many ways the film also speaks to our time.

“Today everybody has a camera in their pocket, news can be live streamed everywhere at every point,” Fehlbaum said. “But while the technology obviously has changed, I think the moral and ethical questions still remain the same.”

While mainstream news broadcasting mostly filters out images of graphic violence, the director said it’s a very different picture on social media. “The ability to live stream and photograph tragic events, and to get informed, are increasing rapidly. We don’t know yet what the implications of that are yet, but I thought it could be interesting for an audience that are used to seeing everything on their smartphones.”

The matter is especially timely – half a century on from Munich, global conflicts, including that between Israel and the Palestinians, continues to rage with horrific casualties. But social media and the democratisation of information has meant there is no shortage of unmediated, graphic images accessible on huge platforms that reach hundreds of millions.

It poses stark questions of whether it’s right to show the realities of extreme violence, whether it propagates the message of perpetrators, or even desensitises us to suffering. Fehlbaum said the film doesn’t attempt to answer these questions, merely highlights them.

“It’s a dilemma, because sometimes these shocking images can have a positive effect, like in the case of George Floyd,” he said. The director was keen to stress that the film does not intend to make a statement on current political events – it was wrapped up before the attack by Hamas on 7 October and the subsequent Israeli war on Gaza. “It’s a reflection on a topic that seemed relevant when the media landscape is constantly evolving: the power of images.”

Sarsgaard said September 5 was “a very important story to be telling right now”.

As someone with both Israeli and Palestinian friends, he said it’s driven home to him how “everyone is consuming things through their own lens. This idea that a live camera pointed at something will be the truth is just never correct, because you’ve decided where to put the camera. You’ve decided where to aim it.

“So we have to look for ways to understand what’s going on, to step into other people’s point of view and try to get as many different angles on the same event as possible.”

Sarsgaard doesn’t consider the Israel-Palestine conflict to be a two-sides issue in any case. “The British are culpable. The US is culpable. Iran is culpable. We’re all in it together. It’s so much bigger than these two parties that are on the front lines.”

The context of the ongoing war in the Middle East has shaped not only how this film is being seen, but also triggered controversy over some other films in the Venice line-up.","A man gestures towards a television screen in a room with people seated, with the headline 'Can we show an act of violence on TV?' from The Observer visible.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6B7DF2D060>,2024-09-01 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/sep/01/can-we-show-an-act-of-violence-on-tv-new-thriller-tells-story-of-munich-hostage-massacre,['Entertainment' 'Politics'],[0.85 0.65],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/c84bc6a7a4.png
ea373f239b,The Associated Press,Jon Stewart's return to 'The Daily Show' felt familiar to those who missed him while he was away - The Associated Press,"NEW YORK (AP) — No, Jon Stewart really wasn’t sitting at his desk at Comedy Central for the last nine years, waiting for someone to turn the lights back on. Yet it almost felt that way during Stewart’s return to “The Daily Show” Monday night. His signature moves — blunt satire, facial grimaces, incisive use of video and some occasional lectures — were all intact. Public figures are served notice that the media’s sharpest bull detector is back on the job. Stewart has said that the lack of a comedic outlet for his observations as the presidential campaign unfolded largely drove his decision to reprise his most memorable role, one night a week through the election. The much-diminished Comedy Central, unable to find a successor to Trevor Noah as host, happily welcomed him back. Questions about the future of late-night TV, which is rapidly shedding viewers and losing influence, won’t be answered in one night. Neither will that night prove Stewart can regain the position of prominence he stepped away from in August 2015. But it was a promising start. “Are you disappointed yet?” Stewart said after one sophomoric joke, about naming “The Daily Show” election coverage, “Indecision 2024: Electile Dysfunction.” HE DOVE DIRECTLY INTO THE NEWS OF THE DAY Stewart seemed to take a page from MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow when she turned a daily hosting role into a weekly one. Both resisted trying to do too much, to cram a week’s — or in Stewart’s case, nine years — worth of material into one show. He moved swiftly into the news, and up-to-date doings of President Joe Biden and his Republican rival. In Biden’s case, it meant directly addressing questions about his age and fitness for office, which the president’s supporters surely want to avoid. He examined Biden’s news conference last week meant to counter characterizations in special counsel Robert Hur’s report on classified documents found in Biden’s home. “Joe Biden had a big press conference to dispel the notion that he may have lost a step and, politically speaking, lost three or four steps,” he said. He said about Biden aides who thought it was a good idea for him to turn down a Super Bowl interview in favor of a TikTok appearance: “Fire everyone.” Stewart showed tape of administration officials like Vice President Kamala Harris and other Democrats testifying to Biden’s sharpness and suggested it might be a good idea to film the president in those meetings so the public can see him. Yet Stewart also used tightly-edited videotape of Donald Trump and his family during depositions saying they couldn’t recall things to counter the notion that Biden is alone in showing memory issues during such high-pressure legal proceedings. “The Daily Show” even found one where Trump said he couldn’t remember talking about how good his memory is. His main point: Worries about whether either the 81-year-old Biden or 77-year-old Trump are up to the toughest job in the world shouldn’t be swept under the rug. “It is the candidates’ job to assuage concerns, not the voters’ job not to mention them,” Stewart said. HE WAS PRETTY WELL-RECEIVED BY CRITICS Based on one night, a handful of critics noted Stewart’s seamless transition. Alison Herman of Variety wrote that “it almost seemed like he never left,” a phrase repeated in the headlines of reviews by both NPR critic Eric Deggans and CNN’s Brian Lowry. “From the show’s opening moments, Stewart eased back into the host’s chair without missing a beat, firing off jokes with a familiar style that felt like he had left just a few weeks ago, rather than in 2015,” Deggans wrote. “He brought a confidence the show sorely needs.” Jeremy Egner of The New York Times wrote that “Stewart’s first night found him grayer — at one point he used his own wizened face as a prop in a joke about the presidential candidates’ ages. But he was otherwise in classic form.” The show was seen by 930,000 people on Comedy Central, and viewership jumped to 1.85 million when a later repeat and simulcasts with other Paramount-owned networks like MTV and Paramount are included, the Nielsen company said. It was the most-watched episode of “The Daily Show” since 2018, and more than double what Trevor Noah averaged in 2022. The comparison of Stewart returning to “The Daily Show” and two candidates likely staging a rematch was too obvious to let go by. Correspondent Dulce Sloan, ostensibly talking about discouraged voters, said they needed someone new, more than just “old white dudes” coming back to reclaim a job. “We’re talking about the election, right?” Stewart said. The “campaign” interlude allowed Stewart, and viewers who had drifted away from “The Daily Show” after he left, to become acquainted with unfamiliar cast members. An on-set interview with Jordan Klepper, who will host the show for the rest of the week, was less successful. During his time away, Stewart spent time as an activist fighting to get benefits for Sept. 11, 2001, responders and two years hosting “The Problem with Jon Stewart” on the Apple TV+ streaming service. He made a subtle allusion to the latter on Monday, saying he would be making jokes about China and AI, subjects that reportedly made Apple uncomfortable before axing the show. ___ David Bauder covers media for The Associated Press.

167973e518,ABC News,Mpox was declared a global public health emergency by the WHO. Now what? - ABC News,"The spread of a newer strain of mpox in Africa led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the disease a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on Wednesday.

This newer strain is believed to be behind an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) with more than 14,000 cases -- mostly among children -- and more than 500 deaths, and has been detected in neighboring countries that had never reported countries of mpox before.

On Thursday, Sweden became the first nation outside of the African continent to report a case of the newer strain of mpox, according to the country's public health agency.

Cases of other strains, or clades, of mpox have popped up in other countries. In the U.S., there are more than 1,600 cases reported this year so far, more than twice the number seen at this time last year but not as many as seen during the outbreak in 2022-23.

""It's clear that a coordinated international response is essential to stop these outbreaks and save lives,"" said WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus during a media briefing on Wednesday.

Experts told ABC News that by declaring a PHEIC, the WHO can help more countries collaborate by sharing data, allocating resources and helping make vaccines more readily available.

What is a PHEIC?

A PHEIC is defined as ""an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response,"" by the International Health Regulations.

To be considered a PHEIC, the condition is considered, serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected; has implications for public health beyond where the place it originates; and has the potential to require immediate international action, according to the WHO.

""This is really [the WHO's] highest level of alert,"" Thomas Duszynski, director of epidemiology education at Indiana University's Fairbanks School of Public Health, told ABC News.

""This means that this particular virus, or the mpox virus, and the illnesses that it causes, has reached a level that is now at a much higher rate than it should be, than when we see like in a normal year, as well as it's starting to spill outside of the country of the Democratic Republic of Congo, which means that we have to get our arms around it and try and contain it,"" he said.

A PHEIC was last declared for mpox during the outbreak in 2022-23, but this current outbreak is different because it involves a clade called clade Ib that seems to spread more quickly and has a higher mortality rate, Duszynski said.

What becomes available when a PHEIC is declared?

Emily Smith, an associate professor in the Department of Global Health at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health, said declaring a PHEIC can help galvanize collaboration and mobilize resources.

""Collaboration can be really important in terms of sharing data from different surveillance systems or even things like genomic sequences, so we can understand how different cases are related to each other,"" she told ABC News.

On the mobilizing resources front, Tedros said during the media briefing on Wednesday that WHO had released $1.5 million in contingency funds and planned to release more soon. The WHO's regional response plan -- including support surveillance and preparedness and response activities -- will cost $15 million.

Additionally, last week, the WHO triggered the process to begin allowing mpox vaccines to go through the process for emergency use listing, similar to what was seen with the COVID-19 vaccine during the pandemic.

The PHEIC will also allow vaccines to be sent to other affected countries more quickly than they might have been without an emergency declaration, Duszynski said.

""In the Democratic Republic of Congo, their access to the impact vaccine is limited,"" he said. ""So, for example, the U.S. has dedicated 50,000 doses of that vaccine for the Democratic Republic of Congo, so that that's part of that cooperation of not only sending, knowledge and science and research, but also aid, in the sense of vaccines.""

""We could also send personnel, such as epidemiologists, to help with the investigation and to help identify those who are ill and put some isolation and quarantine around those individuals to keep this virus from spreading,"" Duszynski added.

What should the public do?

The experts said the best thing to do is to get vaccinated if you are a high-risk individual.

Currently, the JYNNEOS vaccine, a two-dose vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration to prevent smallpox and mpox, is the only vaccine being used in the United States to prevent mpox. Data from Africa has shown two doses of JYNNEOS are at least 85% effective in preventing mpox infection.

High-risk individuals include those who are immunocompromised, suffer from chronic diseases, or have a history of eczema, which causes breaks in the skin and can lead to mpox transmission.

Smith said other high-risk individuals include gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men -- a group that was most affected during the 2022-23 outbreak -- should get vaccinated.

She said that anyone who has only received their first dose should be sure to get their second dose.

""Just be aware if you or anyone you know, or your family, experiences lesions, skin lesions or genital lesions,"" Smith added. ""[You] definitely want to contact your doctor. We do have treatment options available in the U.S.""",A sign for the World Health Organization is displayed in front of a modern building.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6B7EDFD7E0>,2024-08-15 20:21:00+00:00,https://abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/declared-mpox-global-public-health-emergency/story?id=112873324,['Health' 'International'],[0.95 0.85],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/167973e518.png
b03bc018fb,TIME,What Baby Reindeer’s ‘Real Martha’ Disputes—and Doesn’t - TIME,"“This is a true story.”

That’s what’s displayed over a black screen at the start of Netflix’s hit stalker series Baby Reindeer. It’s also the opening of a defamation complaint against the streamer, alleging the five-word phrase to be “the biggest lie in television history.”

Baby Reindeer, which premiered on Netflix on April 11, is based on the experiences of Scottish comedian Richard Gadd, depicting a character named Donny—played by Gadd, who wrote the show and the one-man stage production it is adapted from—being stalked by an older Scottish woman named Martha, portrayed by Jessica Gunning.

Within days of Baby Reindeer airing, online sleuths identified the so-called “real Martha” as 58-year-old Scottish woman Fiona Harvey. In a lawsuit filed on Thursday in Los Angeles before the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Harvey is demanding a jury trial and seeking at least $170 million in damages from Netflix for alleged defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, and violations of her right of publicity (unpermitted use of her identity and likeness).

As a result of being linked to the show, Harvey claims that her “life had been ruined” and that Netflix “destroyed her reputation, her character, and her life.”

The character of Martha is depicted as a twice-convicted stalker who physically and sexually assaulted Gadd’s character, was said to have stalked a police officer, camped outside Gadd’s character’s home for up to 16 hours a day, and spent more than five years in jail for multiple sentences—things that Harvey says are all untrue about herself.

“The real Martha is reasonably understood by all viewers to have done all of these monstrous things because Netflix and Gadd stated this was true,” reads the complaint. “Defendants told these lies, and never stopped, because it was a better story than the truth, and better stories made money.”

Harvey alleges that Netflix “intended to inflict injury” upon her and did “literally nothing” to confirm the details of its “true story,” which ended up becoming a runaway success watched by more than 65 million people worldwide.

Netflix executive Benjamin King told a U.K. parliamentary committee in May that the show was “obviously a true story” of the abuse Gadd experienced “at the hands of a convicted stalker” and that Netflix “did take every reasonable precaution in disguising the real-life identities of the people involved in that story.” After the complaint was filed, a representative for Netflix told Variety: “We intend to defend this matter vigorously and to stand by Richard Gadd’s right to tell his story.”

Here’s what to know about the case.

“Hang my curtains”: How Harvey claims her identity was revealed

Like Netflix, Gadd claimed that his team had taken care to obscure the person who was the basis for Martha in Baby Reindeer, telling GQ in April that they had “gone to such great lengths to disguise her to the point that I don’t think she would recognize herself.”

Gadd has also urged viewers to refrain from speculating on the real-life identities of characters. “That’s not the point of our show,” he said. He told The Hollywood Reporter in May that he would not comment on the topic ever again, saying “if I wanted the real life people to be found, I would’ve made it a documentary.”

But, the complaint alleges, “the identification of Harvey as ‘Martha’ was easy and took a matter of days as Harvey’s identity was completely undisguised.”

“Like ‘Martha,’ Harvey is a Scottish lawyer, living in London, twenty years older than Gadd, was accused of stalking a lawyer in a newspaper article, and who bears an uncanny resemblance to ‘Martha,’” the complaint said. “Further, ‘Martha’s’ accent, manner of speaking and cadence, is indistinguishable for Harvey’s.”

The complaint also points to a key detail that allegedly exposed Harvey’s identity in the very first episode of the show: Donny jokes about hanging Martha’s curtains for her—a euphemism for sex; later in the episode, among the dozens of emails Martha sends Donny daily was one that read: “myy curtains r waitinfro yu they r ready.”

It wasn’t long before social media users dug up a 2014 tweet from Harvey to Gadd that said: “my curtains need hung badly,” after which Harvey says she started to be inundated by messages from strangers identifying her as Martha.

Harvey then appeared on Piers Morgan Uncensored on May 10 for a nearly hour-long interview in which she claimed to have inspired the name of the show—a reference to a childhood toy—but that nearly everything else associated with her was untrue, despite the apparent similarities between her and the character Martha.

Morgan, during his interview with Harvey, argued that her swift identification showed that Netflix and Gadd’s duty of care had been “a spectacular failure,” and Harvey said at the time that she intended to sue.

Alleged defamation over depictions of assault and harassment

According to Harvey’s complaint, Baby Reindeer contains several defamatory claims about her. The show depicts Martha sexually assaulting Donny by grabbing his penis without his consent, as well as later physically assaulting him by hitting his head with a glass bottle and pushing his eyes with her thumbs. Harvey maintains that she has neither had sexual encounters with Gadd nor physically attacked him.

Moreover, while Martha was shown waiting at a bus stop outside Donny’s house for up to 16 hours a day for multiple days, Harvey denounced the depiction as a “psychotic lie,” claiming that she had “never waited outside Gadd’s residence.” (In her interview with Morgan, Harvey said she had only ever met Gadd “two or three times,” later revised to “five-six.”)

And unlike Martha from the show, who was described as previously convicted and sentenced to 4.5 years in prison for a separate case and then depicted to have pleaded guilty to harassing Gadd and his parents, Harvey says she has never been convicted of any crimes or gone to prison. The complaint also claimed that, whereas Martha was said to have previously stalked a police officer, Harvey has done no such thing.

Because of all these “brutal lies,” the complaint said, Harvey has been subjected to immense distress. The barrage of messages Harvey has received, including death threats, have allegedly caused her to suffer from anxiety, nightmares, depression, isolation, and a fear of leaving her home or reading the news. “Since being identified,” the complaint said, “Harvey has been tormented.”

What’s not mentioned in the complaint

Notably absent in Harvey’s complaint is any mention of the 41,071 emails, 350 hours’ worth of voicemails, 744 tweets, 46 Facebook messages, and 106 pages of letters Martha sent to Donny, a central detail repeated throughout the show and about which Harvey has been questioned since the airing of Baby Reindeer. “None of that’s true. I don’t think I sent him anything,” Harvey told Morgan in May, before quickly revising her recollection to say that she had sent just “a handful” or “less than 10” emails and just “one letter.”

“Even if the email thing was true,” she added at the time, “the rest is not.”

In recent weeks, Harvey has been accused of sending numerous emails to other public figures, including Labor politician and potential future Prime Minister Keir Starmer, whom she had reportedly sent 276 messages over the span of less than eight months. Some of the emails were laden with expletives and insults, including calling Starmer a “stupid little boy” and using a slur against his wife, The Sun reported.

Harvey also denied to Morgan that she had ever heckled Gadd during his comedy performances, as Martha was depicted to have done to Donny in the show, or that she had ever assaulted his girlfriend like Martha did. Neither, however, was mentioned in the complaint outlining how Harvey felt she was defamed.

And while Harvey did claim in her complaint that she has never stalked Gadd, she did not address accusations that she has faced about stalking her former employer at a law firm—a detail that was also depicted in Baby Reindeer through the fictional newspaper headline “Sick stalker targets barrister’s deaf child.” As online sleuths unearthed newspaper articles from the early 2000s about Harvey reportedly harassing Laura Wray, a lawyer and widow of a former politician, Wray told The Daily Mirror in May that the show’s Martha was undeniably a portrayal of the Harvey she remembered. “It was obvious to me and to a lot of other people that she was my stalker,” Wray said. “The only thing they changed about her was her name. The lady Jessica [Gunning] who played Martha was excellent … I mean, she had the same laugh, even the same slightly kind of funny waddling walk.”","A woman in a pink and green striped sweater is reading a newspaper while sitting in a cafe, with a man in a black jacket standing to her left.",<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x117 at 0x7D6BA57EFE20>,2024-06-07 09:00:00+00:00,https://time.com,https://time.com/6986551/baby-reindeer-martha-lawsuit-netflix-defamation-fiona-harvey/,['Entertainment' 'Other'],[0.9 0.1],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/b03bc018fb.png
80e4bef991,CNN,The Wall Street Journal’s story about Biden’s mental acuity suffers from glaring problems - CNN,"Editor’s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.

The Wall Street Journal owes its readers — and the public — better.

The business broadsheet published and hyped a story Wednesday declaring that “behind closed doors,” President Joe Biden has shown “signs of slipping.” The story questioned Biden’s mental acuity, playing into a GOP-propelled narrative that the 81-year-old president lacks the fitness to hold the nation’s highest office.

But an examination of the report reveals a glaring problem: Most of the sources reporters Annie Linskey and Siobhan Hughes relied on were Republicans. In fact, buried in the story, the reporters themselves acknowledged that they had drawn their sweeping conclusion based on GOP sources who, obviously, have an incentive to make comments that will damage Biden’s candidacy.

“Most of those who said Biden performed poorly were Republicans, but some Democrats said that he showed his age in several of the exchanges,” Linskey and Hughes conceded. The duo also noted that they had spoken to sources in the administration “who found no fault” with the way Biden conducted himself in meetings for which they were present.

Republicans accusing their political foe of lacking the mental fitness to hold office is nothing surprising. Such accusations are made every night on Fox News. And Donald Trump, who at 77 years old has also shown plenty of signs of waning mental faculties, including repeatedly falling asleep at his own high-stakes hush money trial, has made the accusation a centerpiece of his campaign. In other words, these accusations from the right aren’t exactly news.

“It’s a little surprising that The Wall Street Journal thought it was breaking news when congressional Republicans told them the same false claims they’ve spouted on Fox News for years,” White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said, “but it’s also telling that the only individuals willing to smear the President in this story are political opponents afraid to use their names — plus one proven liar.”

Even more inexplicable is why The Journal would quote former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in the piece as a serious person speaking in good faith. McCarthy is, in fact, a MAGA Republican who has for years lied on behalf of Trump. I’m sure reporters at The Journal would acknowledge McCarthy’s extreme record of dishonesty in private. So why present him to readers as an honest arbiter of reality?

The New York Times’ Katie Rogers and Annie Karni even reported last year that McCarthy had praised Biden’s mental faculties when speaking amongst confidantes — a starkly different tune than the one he is now singing in public. “Privately, Mr. McCarthy has told allies that he has found Mr. Biden to be mentally sharp in meetings,” Rogers and Karni reported in March 2023. Rogers re-upped that reporting on Wednesday in the wake of The Journal’s story.

Bizarrely, while quoting McCarthy, The Journal apparently ignored on-the-record statements provided by high-ranking Democrats. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi disclosed that she spoke to the newspaper, but she was notably not quoted in the piece. Other Democrats went public on Wednesday with similar experiences. Instead, one of the only on-the-record quotes in the entire story was delivered by the former Republican leader who would lie about the color of the sky if it pleased Trump.

“The Journal ignored testimony by Democrats, focused on attacks by Republicans and printed a hit piece,” Pelosi protested on X.

Hughes responded to the criticism Wednesday, telling “CNN News Central” that her job “is to be the agent of the reader” and that she is not going to “publish the quote provided to me or us by every single Democrat.”

A spokesperson for The Journal told me that the Rupert Murdoch-owned newspaper, which is under the stewardship of newish editor Emma Tucker, “stands by its reporting.” If Tucker is comfortable with such shoddy journalism, it is worrisome.

It is difficult to imagine that the newspaper, or any outlet, would run a similar story declaring that Trump is “slipping” behind the scenes based on the word of top Democratic figures — despite the fact that the Democratic leadership has demonstrated a much stronger relationship with the truth in recent years than their Republican counterparts.

More broadly speaking, The Journal’s piece pointed to a continued problem roiling the news media as it covers the 2024 election. Trump is permitted to fall asleep in court and make nonsensical public statements on a routine basis without any serious questions raised about his mental acuity. Meanwhile, Biden is judged on an entirely different standard.

Where are the stories about Trump’s former inner circle raising questions about his mental fitness? Alyssa Farah Griffin, who served as his communications director, has publicly stated that Trump is “not as sharp” as he once was. Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who served as ambassador to the United Nations under Trump, has also repeatedly raised issues about the Republican candidate’s mental fitness, describing him as “declining” and “diminished” and “not the same person he was in 2016.”

“Hope the Wall Street Journal feels free to reach out to any one of us who worked in the Trump Admin. Happy to discuss Trump’s mental acuity & fitness for office,” Olivia Troye, a former Trump administration official, sarcastically wrote on X. “We can start with the closed doors discussions on milkshakes during intel briefings, windmills causing cancer, what bleach does & doesn’t do & go from there.”",An older man in a suit stands in front of a blurred background with American flags.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BC75D1C60>,2024-06-06 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/06/media/wall-street-journal-biden-mental-acuity/index.html,['Politics' 'Opinion/Editorial'],[0.9  0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/80e4bef991.png
d9a9eed78f,Financial Times,Temu’s global expansion now looks fraught with difficulty - Financial Times,"Temu has changed the world of online shopping. Its rapid growth means it rivals Amazon in many markets. But this week, shares of its owner PDD Holdings have fallen the most on record after it warned that revenue growth would inevitably trend downwards amid rising competition and an economic slowdown. The biggest threat to Temu, however, may be changing regulations in the US and Europe.

Chinese-owned ecommerce platform PDD’s US depositary receipts fell nearly 30 per cent in New York on Monday. The company faces aggressive competition from rivals such as ByteDance’s TikTok and Alibaba. PDD’s sales of Rmb97.1bn ($13.6bn) for the June quarter missed expectations. Its rapid revenue growth, more than doubling in recent quarters, is proving unsustainable.

Profitability should start taking a hit, too. A big part of PDD’s rapid growth has been thanks to its ultra-low pricing strategy. As local peers started following PDD’s strategy, it has had to splurge on marketing and advertising to keep customers. This is reflected in its nearly 50 per cent increase in operating expenses in its latest quarter, while general and administrative costs more than tripled due to staff-related expenses.

Another pillar of Temu’s success has been a loophole that waives import tariffs for shipments into the US with a fair retail value below $800. In the European Union, under current regulations, packages that are bought online from a non-EU country are not subject to customs duties if their value is under €150.

Closing these loopholes is not proving straightforward. A change in the current regulations would mean local online shoppers are charged import tariffs on cross-border purchases. That in turn would mean higher costs when buying a wide range of products from overseas — and not just when shopping on Temu. This has raised concerns over the potential for steep import fees and other duties on items such as clothing.

Nevertheless, Temu’s surging market share in recent months has accelerated calls for further regulatory scrutiny on the current import tax exemption, with the EU working on a proposal to close the loophole. In the US, lawmakers have also been pushing for a crackdown.

PDD’s shares have gained 24 per cent in the past year, significantly outperforming Alibaba, whose stock is down more than a tenth, and Temu’s second-largest rival, JD.com, which is down nearly a quarter over the same period.

Even so, PDD trades at just eight times forward earnings, a small fraction of global peers such as Amazon, reflecting a slower growth outlook. Temu has proved that a global expansion strategy is the way to go amid a saturated ecommerce market at home. But even that is now looking fraught with difficulty.",A person's hand is holding a smartphone displaying the Temu website with a shopping cart and various product images.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BCAD8DEA0>,2024-08-27 07:35:37.885000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/ea2bf29b-dae9-4509-bf62-08805dc4560e,['Business and Finance' 'International' 'National'],[0.95 0.8  0.75],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/d9a9eed78f.png
87321a7bcd,Bloomberg,The Riviera in Greece That Tourists Haven’t Invaded Yet - Bloomberg,"Hello, it’s Sarah Rappaport, your Pursuits correspondent in London. By the time this hits your inbox, I’ll be on a beach in Greece, out of the office and cocktail in hand.

This will be my seventh trip in eight years. I love the hospitality of the people, swimming in the sea and, of course, the food. Plus, my parents’ first date was at a restaurant in Greektown in Chicago, so I feel like in a very tiny way I owe my existence to Greece. I’ve been lucky enough to make several Greek friends in London who have shown me around Athens and islands like Hydra and Spetses.

And I’m not alone—2024 is looking like it’ll set tourism records in the Mediterranean country. Which of course can be a problem, from the perspective of both the environment and the local infrastructure. Islands heave in the busy season, especially with visitors pouring off cruise ships in droves. The country’s prime minister says he’s looking at plans to restrict cruises for the most popular islands.

I like to stay in the Athens Riviera, however. It feels like an escape for locals. It’s the sunny stretch of coastline that runs for about 37 miles from the main port of Piraeus Harbor, where many of the ferries leave, down to the southern tip of Attica at Cape Sounion, home to the Temple of Poseidon.

The area was a hot spot in the 1960s, when it was the playground of Aristotle and Jackie Onassis and other luminaries. Now it’s having a boom in luxury hotels; the One&Only Aesthesis opened recently, and the Ace Hotel is coming soon, drawing more visitors to the area.

Its proximity to the center of Athens is also a draw. The last time I was there, it took me less than 30 minutes by car to get from my hotel to the Acropolis (which is always worth a visit). The Acropolis Museum is also great, with an indoor-outdoor cafe that has one of the best views in the world. It’s even doing an event for the full moon this August!

Here are a few of my favorite things to do on the Athens Riviera.

Visit the stylish Four Seasons Astir Palace Hotel Athens

This is the only hotel in Greece to notch a spot on theWorld’s 50 Best Hotel list. I’m obsessed with its restaurant, Taverna 37, which is right on the sea and open to nonguests as well as those staying at the hotel. Get a table on the water to watch the sunset.

Spend all day at Astir Beach

All right, it does cost €80 ($87) to rent a pair of sunbeds on a weekday. But the sun loungers at Astir Beach, next to the Four Seasons on a serene peninsula, have little buttons to press for waiter service, so you can get freddo cappucinos and Aperol spritzes delivered all day long. The water is crystal clear, ideal for swimming, and the facilities include a Dior pop-up shop. Next door, you’ll also find the still-standing columns of the small temple of Apollo Zoster, which dates to the sixth century B.C. How many other beaches come with their own ancient temple?

Have a meal and a chill at Krabo

This restaurant with its own stretch of beach is tranquil at lunch and a party spot in the evening. Set in a secluded bay, it sports Greek island vibes without being on an island—you can totally forget you’re in the city altogether when you’re there. I recommend getting the orzo with red snapper and going for a swim in the Aegean after.

Have brunch at Sofi’s Eatery

I love a good coffee shop, and Sofi’s has a view of the sea, fresh-pressed green juices and loads of brunch options from homemade honey-and-walnut cakes to smoked salmon and eggs. Sofi’s design and menu might not look out of place in Brooklyn or Shoreditch, but it’s always buzzy with locals, and thanks to its location on one of the major streets in the upscale neighborhood of Vouliagmeni, it’s a great spot for people watching.

Visit the Temple of Poseidon

This marvelous temple, dedicated to the god of the sea, is a bit of a schlep—around 40 minutes’ drive from the rest of the locations mentioned here—but that means it gets many fewer visitors than the Acropolis. Overlooking the sea, the whitewashed marble ruins are most magical at sunset. It’s easiest to get there by car down the coastal route, but I got directed to a bus from my hotel the last time I went, and it was easy, pleasant and cheap.

Fair warning, the bus is on an “it’ll show up when it shows up” schedule, so you wouldn’t do this if you were on a tight schedule. But you’re on vacation: Embrace the Greek life and be open to things not going exactly to plan.

What to do in Mykonos

After my time in the Riviera, I’m taking a ferry to Mykonos, completely disregarding my own advice to hit up smaller islands instead.

I’ve had a stressful summer (not a brat one, unfortunately) and would prefer an itinerary that features more than the hedonist nightlife the island is known for. But I will probably still end up at Scorpios or one of the other famous beach clubs at some point.

I asked Eric Mourkakos, owner of Cali Mykonos, a stellar seaside retreat on the quieter southeastern side of the island, for recommendations on what to do. Here are his top three tips for taking it easy on Summer Island.

Take a private boat trip to Tragonisi

This uninhabited islet, reachable only by boat, is just a few miles from Mykonos. Make sure to paddleboard through the island’s caves and discover hidden beaches and coves.

Have lunch at Fokos Taverna

Located in the northeastern corner of Mykonos, this family-owned restaurant on the beach serves dishes full of fresh and local flavors. The restaurant asks you to bring cash to pay; the Wi-Fi signal sometimes doesn’t work in this secluded location.

Tour Rizes Farmstead

On a guided tour through this area, guests can meet the estate’s sheep, chickens and horses. Visitors can even help out at the farmstead, collecting eggs and veggies alongside workers. There are also workshops where traditional musical instruments are crafted, alongside painting studios and a loom.

Where else should you travel?

If that’s all Greek to you, it’s not too late to book a great trip somewhere else this August. Here’s some inspiration.

You had questions …

We call for queries weekly on our Instagram account and via e-mail. Here’s what you were dying to know about this time around.

Is Europe getting too hot for summer vacations?

Great question, @Camilla.Dell. This is certainly the topic of discussion in my circles at the moment. Clearly, the heat hasn’t dissuaded me from going to Greece in August, but I spoke to several luxury travel agents last year who said the record high temperatures had them recommending clients book trips in Northern Europe instead of the Mediterranean.

The trend has been dubbed the “coolcation”—and I expect we’ll start seeing it more and more. It’s possible that October may replace August as high season in the coming years in the Med, as heat waves and extreme weather gain intensity and frequency. For now, there’s always “Cold Hawaii.”

I’m thinking about cycling in the Swiss Alps, what do you think?

Hi, @Yelssant! I’ve been hearing more and more about how great Switzerland is during the summer, and not just as a ski destination. So I think you’re really onto something. A friend of mine raves about the Chedi Andermatt.

Having never done a cycling trip, I can’t give you personal recs, but as luck would have it, I just spoke to Mike Scarola, chief executive officer of luxury active travel company Butterfield & Robinson, for another piece. Scarola’s a former Olympian, having competed in the Athens 2004 Games. His advice for cycling trips was to pick the right bike (don’t dismiss an e-bike!), and make sure you get plenty of time in the saddle to get comfortable before you head out on your vacation.

If you aren’t entirely set on Switzerland, you might also give some thought to Taiwan. We sent a writer there a few years back to tackle 150 miles in four days, with just two wheels and almost zero Mandarin. His review: incredible.

Am I too broke to go to Europe?

I don’t know your situation, but there are ways to go to Europe that don’t involve breaking the bank. Discount carriers such as Norse Atlantic sell flights for $200 one-way. Set Google Flight Alerts, use a service like Hopper, and be smart about using data to nab cheaper flights.

However, over the years, the biggest factor I’ve found in how much a trip is going to cost mostly comes down to timing. A vacation is going to be cheaper outside of school holidays than in peak summer or around the end of the year. A night at the chic Margi Hotel in the Athens Rivera is about $700 now, but less than $350 in October. And, hey, the weather will likely be less hot then, too, but still warm enough to swim. You don’t need to go in August to have a wonderful time.

And definitely check out our special “Europe for Less” report from earlier this year, which gives 27 trip ideas to make your vacation budget go further—without sacrificing luxury.

563856b0d1,CBC.ca,"Ukrainian drone tactics make their way to Kursk region, Russian military bloggers suggest - CBC.ca","Kyiv has said little about its rapid entry into Russia's Kursk region, only confirming involvement on Saturday.

It seemingly caught Moscow by surprise: In just days, Ukrainian forces have gained control of what army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi has claimed to total 1,000 square kilometres of Russian soil, as of Monday.

How did it happen? While Kyiv has not elaborated, across the border in Russia, military commentators have been rumbling that Ukrainian forces skilfully used drones and jammers to limit Russia's defences and break into Kursk.

Some outside observers say this view seems to make sense, while cautioning that those same commentators may only be able to see a slice of the wider picture.

""It does seem plausible,"" said Samuel Bendett, an adviser with the Russia Studies program at CNA, a research and analysis organization in Washington, D.C.

Soaring drone use

Drones have become increasingly critical to both Russia and Ukraine across nearly 30 months of all-out war in Ukraine. They are used everywhere — from the trenches of the front line, to the skies above interior areas of the two countries.

Ukraine, which has created a drone warfare-focused branch of its military, has used drones to destroy Russian tanks, hit warplanes and other military targets, in addition to using longer-range drone models to strike oil and gas facilities far beyond the border.

And it's likewise felt the sting of Russian drones that have killed Ukrainian soldiers and civilians alike, and have damaged infrastructure including power plants.

For Ukraine, relying on technologies like drones has been a way for it to punch above its weight in its fight with Russia.

""We have everything to win the war against the Russian Federation. Everything to replace a person in the trench, at sea, in the air and underwater,"" said Ivan Havryliuk, a deputy defence minister, in remarks reported by ABC News earlier this year.

Along the front line, troops from both sides are constrained by the hovering threat of the drones above. Small, first-person view (FPV) drones are routinely used to hunt individual soldiers.

Yet these same obstacles did not stop Ukraine from advancing into Kursk, raising the question of how.

A handful of published reports — some citing the observations of Russian war bloggers — suggests that Ukraine used drones and signal-jamming devices to down Russian surveillance capabilities and then attack the ground ahead, as Ukraine's own troops made their advance.

Bendett said it's not a surprise that Ukraine would be using such approaches. He, along with others, saw other factors beyond drones as being key to Kyiv's early success in Kursk, such as operational secrecy and the element of surprise. However, he said, the technology is something that Ukraine has been developing, testing and ultimately competing with Russia on.

""We know Ukraine are ahead of Russia, when it comes to developing [these] tactics and techniques,"" he said.

Journalist David Axe, who has been covering the conflict, sees Ukraine putting a new spin on an old method in Kursk.

""It's a creeping barrage of jammers and drones,"" Axe wrote in his newsletter Trench Art.

That's not to say Russia has not been fighting back. A report from The Economist quotes Ukrainian soldiers describing ""a demonic buzz"" in the skies above Kursk, as both Russian planes and drones soared above them.

But drones remained part of Ukraine's Kursk offensive more than a week into its existence, with Russia claiming on Wednesday to have shot down 117 drones during the overnight period.

Knowing when and where to strike

Oleksiy Goncharenko, a Ukrainian lawmaker, said that some details have been leaking to the media since the Kursk offensive got underway last week.

While not privy to operational details himself, Goncharenko says it's clear the military action was carefully planned.

""I understand that you need to attack places where you wouldn't expect it,"" he told CBC News in an emailed statement. ""That's what the Ukrainian Armed Forces did. If we used new tactics and new technologies, that's definitely a plus.""

Several observers who spoke to CBC News noted that the part of the border where Ukraine launched its offensive was not well defended.

""They weren't the most high-quality units,"" said John Hardie, deputy director of the Russia Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a U.S. think-tank.

Add in the fact that the incursion may not have been expected — though a New York Times report suggests Russian military leaders didn't act on a warning about a potential attack — and you can see how the wheels could be set in motion for a successful result.

""[Ukraine] achieved a significant element of surprise in the early days of the offensive,"" said Hardie, who predicted that Russia's defensive efforts ""will become more coherent"" in the days ahead.

Bigger questions beyond Kursk

Would Ukraine's approach have worked as well in an area where Russia had more experienced troops? That's an open question, said CNA's Bendett.

And whether it can happen again will depend on Russia's ability to come up with counter-measures against the tactics used in Kursk, he said.

Nick Reynolds, a research fellow in land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute in the U.K., is skeptical of the significance of drones and electronic warfare to the events in Kursk.

He said via email that it's unclear how much planning was needed for the Kursk offensive, and also to what degree Ukraine has been able to integrate its drone-and-jamming tactics with planned manoeuvres.

It also remains to be seen if Ukraine can repeat ""the same effects when they are not conducting a meticulously pre-planned operation.""",Two men in camouflage are working on a drone in a wooded area with a car in the background.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BCAD58F40>,2024-08-14 08:00:00+00:00,https://www.cbc.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-kursk-offensive-drones-russia-1.7292736,['International' 'Politics'],[0.9 0.7],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/563856b0d1.png
1724467546,USA TODAY,RNC vibe check: Somber but confident in a Trump victory - USA TODAY,"MILWAUKEE - Donald Trump's conventioneers are experiencing a mix of emotions this week: Reverent, somewhat subdued over Saturday's assassination attempt, and supremely confident that victory is at hand.

It's complicated when your candidate is nearly killed.

From the food trucks along Wisconsin Avenue to the convention hall at Fiserv Forum, Trump Republicans marvel at Trump's survival of an assassination attempt, along with the political struggles of Democratic President Joe Biden.

While concerned about Trump's health - his bandaged ear has become an icon, and some delegates have patched their own ears in solidarity - most Republicans are also giddy at the prospect that Trump may come out of this week's convention in the battleground state of Wisconsin as a stronger presidential candidate.

The overall political vibe is positive, at least as far as the GOP is concerned.

""It's more electric than I've seen,"" said Hogan Gidley, a former Trump spokesman who attended an interview on Wednesday of Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the former White House press secretary and now Arkansas's governor, at the ""CNN/Politico Grill.""

When Trump formally accepts his third presidential nomination on Thursday, he will close what is probably the most unified Republican convention since 2000. That was the year that George W. Bush and allies took control of a party that is now very different.

The Republicans had to delay and postpone events at their 2008 and 2012 conventions because hurricanes were barreling toward the United States. Many of the Republicans at those conclaves had serious doubts about whether their nominees - John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012 - could overtake Barack Obama in those elections. They didn't, and both McCain and Romney wound up as Trump critics who would not be welcomed this week in Milwaukee.

There were some GOP doubters at Trump's first convention in 2016. In his convention speech that year, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas pointedly refuse to endorse Trump during his convention speech, and urged delegates to vote their consciences.

This week in Milwaukee: Nary a discouraging word. ""God bless Donald J. Trump,” Cruz said on Tuesday night as Trump delegates whooped it up.

Democrats are also roaming the streets of Milwaukee, offering counter-programming to the Republicans as they do at all GOP conventions. This time around, Democrats agree that their opponents are in a positive mood, but they should be wary of over-confidence.

Pat Dennis, president of a Democratic Super PAC called American Bridge 21st Century, said the Republicans are ""juicing each other up"" at their convention.

Election Day, however, is Nov. 5. ""Elections can change in a moment,"" Dennis said.

That happened last weekend, when a would-be assassin barely missed killing Trump.

As Republicans browsed merchandise stores in the convention hall and on surrounding streets, some described Trump's survival as an act of God, and a sign that he is destined to be president again. Others spoke in wonderment about how Trump stood up after the shooting, shook his fist at the crowd, and yelled, 'fight! Fight!""

This week, as Republicans meet, party, and plan while checking their cell phones, most of the news been about the political struggles of Biden, who came down with COVID for a third time and is still being urged to leave the race because of his age.

As for Trump, some conventioneers noted that their once-and-hopefully-future president has pledged to talk more about national unity in his acceptance speech and moving forward.

""He's toning things down - for him,"" said Renee Cruz, 61, a realtor from Stockton, Mo.

Every convention has its share of entrepreneurs, selling hats, t-shirts, jewelry and various knicknacks. Need a ""Trump shot glass""? They're here. Only this convention has Trump Poetry.

""We're trying to make poetry great again,"" said vendor Gregory Woodman as he sold copies of the first-edition ""Collected Poems of Donald J. Trump (2009-2019),"" which are basically past Trump tweets reprinted in a modernist style.

A sample: ""Entrepreneurs:/It's often/To your advantage/to be underestimated."" Woodman said Republican confidence, and relief, have helped sales.

The positive vibes have also inspired Republican after Republican to roam radio row, pop-up booths arrayed on the floor of the old Milwaukee arena. Former New York City mayor - and Trump personal attorney - Rudy Giuliani said he is having a ""great time"" as he moved from booth to booth talking about the convention.

""We have a good feeling, right?"" said Giuliani, who has been disbarred in New York and also pleaded not guilty to both Arizona and Georgia state criminal charges tied to his role trying to help Trump overturn the results of the 2020 election he lost to Biden. ""Conventions are for winning.""

It's not all sweetness and light. Some Republicans, speaking privately, said there are some quiet arguments going on, from the platform's new plank on abortion to the selection of Ohio Sen. JD Vance as Trump's running mate.

But the near-assassination has muted those complaints - for now. ""They're going for unity and that's really hard to keep together,"" said radio host Julie Mason.

The star of ""The Julie Mason Show"" on SiriusXM’s POTUS Channel also said Republicans are promoting a united front because they believe victory in November is a ""foregone conclusion.""","A man in a suit and tie stands at a podium with a microphone, gesturing with his right hand, with a crowd of people behind him, some with blurred faces, in a formal setting with a blue light in the background.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BCB573340>,2024-07-17 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.usatoday.com,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/17/rnc-2024-trump-scene/74441523007/,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/1724467546.png

A July 25 Facebook post (direct link, archive link) claims the streaming service Netflix made a significant donation to a political candidate.

“Netflix just donated 7 million to Kamala,” reads the post. “Bye bye Netflix! They need to feel this people! Cancel today!”

The post was shared more than 1,000 times in six days. Other Facebook posts shared the claim as well.

Our rating: False

Netflix has not made any donations to Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign. Reed Hastings, the company's co-founder and former CEO, donated to a super PAC affiliated with Harris.

Netflix’s FLIXPAC has been dormant since 2016

There are no records of Netflix as a company making any contribution to Harris' presidential campaign, according to the campaign finance website Open Secrets.

The Federal Election Commission bars corporations from directly contributing to candidates. Netflix does have a super PAC, FLIXPAC, which can make direct donations to federal candidates. But FEC records show it hasn’t donated to anyone since 2016.

There are no credible reports of Netflix using any other mechanism to donate to Harris.

The Facebook post appears to be referencing a donation made by Hastings, Netflix's executive chairman and a Democratic megadonor. He donated $7 million in July to the Republican Accountability PAC, which supports Harris’ presidential run, according to Reuters. Hastings told The Information it was his biggest donation ever in support of a single candidate.

The donation has yet to appear in FEC filings under records for Republican Accountability PAC or Hasting. That's because super PACs report their donors on either a monthly or semiannual basis, according to Open Secrets.

66e9c50a4c,Financial Times,The real face of the Deep State - Financial Times,"In 1987 the then health secretary wept at the harrowing stories of the haemophiliacs who caught HIV from transfusions of infected blood. Not that his tears did much good. Around 25 years later his successor reported that the Treasury was blocking a public inquiry into the scandal for fear of the cost of compensation.

The UK was not alone in being hit by this scandal. But while Canada set up a Royal Commission in 1993, Ireland established a tribunal and compensation scheme in 1997 and France prosecuted its premier, ministers and officials in 1999, Britain stalled, denying responsibility, hiding the truth and doing all it could to avoid paying compensation.

If you seek the fabled Deep State, here it is. It is not found in the campaigning lanyard-wearing civil servants who have so annoyed a government minister, those targeted as enemies of Brexit or even the Treasury officials who dared to doubt Liz Truss’s economic strategy. The deep state is found in the dead hand of officialdom and the compliance of ministers that prioritises institutions over the people they are meant to serve.

The seven-volume Langstaff report into the greatest scandal in NHS history may detail an extreme and awful saga but it is only the worst example of what has been seen in multiple episodes, from the Post Office prosecutions to the Windrush affair, an all too familiar pattern of defensiveness, denial and delay.

For the infected blood tragedy is in fact two scandals; the first specific and shocking, the second dully familiar. The first concerns the narrow groupthink and cold paternalism which disregarded warnings over blood products from high-risk sources, errors which cost 3,000 lives, mostly but not solely haemophiliacs, and put 30,000 at risk of infection with either HIV or hepatitis.

But then came the second, the years of deceit, self-justification, destruction of documents, obfuscation and indifference as the NHS, department of health officials, ministers and prime ministers closed ranks. Their actions were driven by back-covering, a wish to avoid exposing the NHS to legal liability and, above all, the desire to save money. To that end officials maintained a fiction that patients had received “the best treatment available”; that, in the words of one former prime minister it was just “incredibly bad luck”.

The response is a masterclass in evasion, a first-class degree in “computer says no”. While other countries faced up to their errors, the UK turned away.

When ministers pressed officials, they were stymied by a system which knows they will soon move along. In 2002, the then health minister, Yvette Cooper, requested an internal review into one aspect of the scandal. Though completed within months, it was delayed till 2006 and its conclusions altered to fit the official line. Even when efforts were made to ease the financial plight of victims, they were miserly, without admission of fault and motivated solely by political pressure.

And while the primary errors belong to the 1970s and 80s, the obstruction runs through to modern times. In 2020, when it was clear a public inquiry (itself forced only by threat of a parliamentary revolt) would lead to a compensation scheme, ministers continued to delay, pushing the costs into another year and perhaps another government.

Similar patterns can be seen in the case of the sub-postmasters who were wrongly prosecuted and jailed as a result of failings in a new IT system. This too is a story of injustice continuing well after it became clear that something had gone wrong. Post Office leaders suppressed information. Ministers came and went, either not asking the right questions or allowing the issue to be shovelled back to the very people responsible for the injustice in the first place in the name of arm’s-length operational independence.

The walls of obstruction are only breached by investigative journalism, dogged individual MPs and — in the case of the Post Office — a TV dramatisation. Both scandals were in plain sight for decades while governments played for time. Ministers hid behind process, not wishing to “prejudice” ongoing reviews or litigation. And though public inquiries ultimately delivered justice, it is often so delayed that those responsible have moved on. Unwanted recommendations are ignored or quietly shelved.

The Windrush scandal, which saw legitimate British citizens denied access to public services and even deported, was blamed on what an inquiry called the “institutional ignorance and thoughtlessness” of the Home Office. And there are countless other examples, both in the NHS and elsewhere. A 2021 report into a decades-old murder case found senior Metropolitan Police officers obstructing the new inquiry to safeguard the force’s reputation.

When the state gets something wrong an institutional defensiveness kicks in until the failure can no longer be denied. Money must be saved, accountability must be dodged, faith in the institution cannot be jeopardised. And the victims? Well of course it is all very sad, but mistakes happen you know.

Langstaff’s recommendations might help but this is a battle with a culture which has not altered in decades. He depicts not an orchestrated conspiracy but something “more subtle, more pervasive and more chilling”, an institutional groupthink which hides the truth “to save face and to save expense”.

This week, Rishi Sunak promised both compensation and change. The money will be forthcoming. I wish we could be so confident about the change.","A white balance scale with two red droplets, one on each side, against a blue background.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BCB3915A0>,2024-05-22 10:14:59.767000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/ab5a23a4-4bb9-407d-a1b9-dd844143d346,['Politics' 'Health'],[0.85 0.75],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/66e9c50a4c.png
7b06d44380,The New York Times,Conservative Family Scion Sentenced to Nearly 4 Years for Jan. 6 Attack - The New York Times,"For most of his life, Leo Brent Bozell IV has been known as the devout, but somewhat troubled, scion of a famous conservative family — the son of L. Brent Bozell III, a culture warrior and longtime critic of the media, and the grandson of L. Brent Bozell Jr., a fierce anti-Communist and one of the early architects of the anti-abortion movement.

But on Friday, with some of his family sitting near him in the courtroom, Mr. Bozell was sentenced to just under four years in prison for having played a central role in the attack by Trump supporters on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

The 45-month sentence imposed by Judge John D. Bates at a hearing in Federal District Court in Washington was only about a third of the 140 months that the government had initially requested. Judge Bates dismissed the government’s request as “untethered to the circumstances of this case.”

As part of his ruling, Judge Bates determined that Mr. Bozell’s conduct on Jan. 6 technically fit the description needed to apply a so-called terrorism enhancement to his sentence. But the judge decided not to use that enhancement in coming up with the final penalty, saying that branding Mr. Bozell a domestic terrorist was excessively harsh.

“I’m not sure that label is an appropriate label for the defendant to have to carry with him,” he said.

Prosecutors say that few of the rioters participated in as many pivotal breaches of the Capitol building and its grounds as did Mr. Bozell. He was convicted by Judge Bates at a bench trial in September of 10 charges, including obstruction of an official proceeding, civil disorder and assault.

Starting by pushing past police lines on a flight of stairs outside the Capitol, prosecutors say, Mr. Bozell shattered a windowpane of a Senate wing door and then joined in pursuing a Capitol Police officer to within steps of the Senate chamber. Mr. Bozell made his way into Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office and then on to the Senate floor.

“Without people like Mr. Bozell, the riot doesn’t happen,” Ashley Akers, a prosecutor, said.

“He himself facilitated access to the Capitol building for hundreds of other rioters,” she said.

During the sentencing hearing, Mr. Bozell, 44, apologized to two police officers who watched from the gallery. He then turned to address his parents and his wife, apologizing for facing jail time and leaving his wife to raise their three daughters. He described his actions on Jan. 6 as a “devastating reality” that “put a stain on my family forever.”

The Bozells have been deeply enmeshed in the conservative movement for more than half a century, starting with L. Brent Bozell Jr., who served as a speechwriter to Barry Goldwater, the far-right senator from Arizona who won the Republican nomination for president in 1964 but went on to lose the general election in a landslide. Mr. Bozell Jr. was also close to another right-wing luminary of the 20th century, William F. Buckley Jr., having married his sister Patricia.

His son, Mr. Bozell III, made his own mark, mostly in conservative media circles, founding the Media Research Center, an organization with the self-appointed mission of calling out liberal bias. He also created the Parents Television and Media Council, which often filed complaints about supposed examples of indecency on TV.

Mr. Bozell IV, who often goes by the nickname Zeeker, followed a different path, according to court papers filed last month by his former lawyer, William Shipley.

He began a long struggle with alcohol and drug abuse in high school and went on to study Christian theology in college. But he left school without obtaining a degree and ended up making a life for himself selling decks and waterproofing basements, far from the rarefied political and intellectual worlds of his father and grandfather.

Still, he maintained an interest in politics, especially as the 2020 election approached. Ultimately, Mr. Shipley wrote, he became “too personally and emotionally invested in the final outcome” of the contest and came to believe that the results of the race had been “rigged” against President Donald J. Trump.

Just before he handed down the sentence, Judge Bates responded to Mr. Bozell, echoing the words of his new lawyer, Eric Snyder, in saying that considering his family’s political acumen, Mr. Bozell should have anticipated consequences.

The judge also took Mr. Bozell to task for the “ease and, at times, brazenness” with which he gave unconvincing explanations for his behavior during his trial. Judge Bates said he was forced to increase the sentence to reflect explanations made by Mr. Bozell from the stand that “defied both video evidence and common sense.”

“You got caught up in the events, but you’re a sophisticated adult,” the judge said. “You made the decision to testify.”

Mr. Shipley had argued in court papers that even though Mr. Bozell had helped to plan and coordinate “Stop the Steal” events in support of Mr. Trump in the aftermath of Election Day, he traveled to Washington just before Jan. 6 from his home in Pennsylvania for a more innocuous reason: to organize a musical performance. At the last minute, however, the lead singer fell ill and the show did not come together.

Mr. Shipley also claimed that Mr. Bozell had entered the Capitol grounds that day “through a combination of bad judgment and unfortunate curiosity” and eventually “got swept up with the crowd and ‘crossed a line.’”

Mr. Bozell’s family had “concerns when they first learned of the charges in this case,” Mr. Shipley wrote.

His father, L. Brent Bozell III, initially bristled, for example, at the request by prosecutors to have Judge Bates apply the terrorism enhancement.

“No father can vouchsafe for the perfection of his son, and I don’t,” he wrote in a letter to the judge. “Nor should a father ever excuse the inexcusable behavior of his son, not to anyone, to include the judge who will determine his fate, and I won’t do that either.”

“But I will state categorically here what I would say if I was on the stand, under oath,” he went on. “My son is a good man.”","Two images show a person with a blurred face through a shattered window, with a red background.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x117 at 0x7D6BA3DB2B30>,2024-05-17 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/17/us/politics/bozell-jan-6-capitol-sentence.html,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/7b06d44380.png

Re “In Israel, ‘the Darkness Is Everywhere,’” by Megan K. Stack (Opinion guest essay, May 18):

I appreciate Ms. Stack’s essay, in which she makes several important observations about current attitudes among Israelis. However, she leaves out the tragic choices that Palestinians have themselves made in Gaza and the West Bank.

In particular, after the Israeli withdrawal in 2005, Gazans had the opportunity to use huge amounts of international aid to build new residential communities and seaside commercial and tourist destinations.

Instead, they diverted essentially all investment into war preparations, including the rocket and tunnel technology that has proved so formidable in several wars with Israel since then. The extremism of attitudes in this conflict isn’t limited to one side.

To the Editor:

I am grateful to The New York Times for publishing Megan K. Stack’s essay. We need more articles on what it is really like on the ground in Israel, and, as disheartening as it may be, we are all better and more informed for reading it.

Only when Jews in the United States (I am one of them) obtain a greater understanding of the horrible plight of the Palestinian people and what they have been subjected to over decades will we be able to affect our government’s policies to produce a more hopeful outcome for the region.

Until then, this vicious cycle will continue, because, as Ms. Stack so eloquently described, “there is no wall thick enough to suppress forever a people who have nothing to lose.”

To the Editor:

I am dismayed at Megan K. Stack’s one-sided analysis of Israeli policy toward the Palestinians. I am a lifelong supporter of Israel, but I share Ms. Stack’s concern regarding Israel’s extreme right-wing government. Placing all, or even most, of the responsibility at the foot of Israeli Jews, however, is disingenuous.

Consider a counterfactual history in which Arab and Palestinian leaders had said “yes” to any of the opportunities to live next to Jewish neighbors in peace. A simple Arab “yes” might have resulted in two separate states, for two separate indigenous peoples, living side by side.

There might have been no rise of Hamas and Hezbollah, suicide bombings or defensive barriers. Both parties could have lived in peace, dignity and prosperity.

Re “Trump Solicits Billion Dollars at Oil Dinner” (front page, May 10):

It is a clarion call to get big money out of politics.

You report that Donald Trump “told a group of oil executives and lobbyists gathered at a dinner at his Mar-a-Lago resort last month that they should donate $1 billion to his presidential campaign because, if elected, he would roll back environmental rules that he said hampered their industry.”

Fossil fuel interests already pour tens of millions of dollars into political campaigns, mostly to Republicans, pushing that party’s congressional delegation and presidential nominee to oppose action against climate change.

This push for contributions and profits is in the face of the virtual unanimity of climate scientists that burning fossil fuels is the main cause of global warming.

Big contributions from gun, pharmaceutical, insurance, financial and other wealthy interests also powerfully influence our system in their favor, usually to the disadvantage of ordinary people. When one or a few big donors can buy more political speech than tens of millions of ordinary people combined, the system is rigged in favor of those who already have the most.

Public funding of election campaigns has worked well at the state, county and city levels. It elevates merit and the public interest in government decision-making and builds confidence in our system.

‘Journey’ as Metaphor

To the Editor:

Re “When Did Everything Turn Into a ‘Journey’?” (front page, May 16):

Name the journey — infertility, breast cancer, weight loss, motherhood or a cathartic vacation — and I’ve been on it.

“Journey” has become a euphemism for struggle, often a long, winding road with ups and downs. Some people may reach the finish line and celebrate triumphantly. Others may never get there, leaving loved ones to wonder how their “choose your own adventure” could have followed a different chapter. No journey is ever truly complete.

Infertility may be behind me, but its wake — a stillborn son, a ruptured uterus, a C-section scar, new family members in our surrogates who carried our daughters — will reverberate for my lifetime.

Many individuals will face infertility for the first time today, tomorrow or someday in the future. I always make time for those who reach out to me, hoping my experience can help them — or, at the very least, give them a chance to talk to someone on the metaphorical “other side.”

Journeys can break us or make us into someone new. Whatever euphemism we use, the important thing is don’t make it your ending when you get to the other side. Make it a new beginning to help those who follow in your footsteps.

To the Editor:

With respect to cancer, its patients and their families — and all those dismayed by what linguists call “semantic drift” — let’s agree to call cancer a “situation.” Not a sentimental, self-help journey. Not a grim or rousing battle. Definitely something fraught and serious: a situation that compels utmost attention and action over time, time that makes no promises.

Re “Citing Safety, New York Moves Mentally Ill People From the Subway” (news article, May 11):

As New Yorkers daily enter our transit system, the sight of men and women sleeping on station benches or in subway cars causes mixed emotions ranging from dismay to fear to disgust. The mantra from the riders, either mumbled or spoken aloud, usually goes: “Why can’t the mayor clean this up?”

And it’s a mantra that has, for decades now, moved mayors, under the guise of compassion, to take aggressive action to remove from the subways those who are poor, more often than not homeless, and desperately struggling with mental health issues.

Of course, the cynics in us understand the politics of the moment and the need for mayors to show strength and resolve, even if their actions provide only a short-term fix.

Yes, these are difficult and seemingly intractable problems. But we’re never going to find lasting solutions unless we begin to understand and address the root issues.

As a start, we need to understand how these folks were allowed to fall deeper and deeper into the cracks. How community-based health and mental health systems — often nonexistent or, at best, bare-bones in poor communities — were unable to provide any real, meaningful support before they became so lost to us.","An abandoned house with a broken window, a basketball hoop, and a chair in the yard.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x117 at 0x7D6BCAEA0190>,2024-05-20 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/20/opinion/israel-gaza-despair.html,['Opinion/Editorial' 'Politics'],[0.9 0.8],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/bd10c90509.png
ec06a4d143,The Associated Press,Analysis: Real test for NFL’s new kickoff rule begins in the regular season - The Associated Press,"On Football analyzes the biggest topics in the NFL from week to week. For more On Football analysis, head here.

___

The NFL’s new kickoff rule did what it was implemented to do in the preseason.

Still, we haven’t seen everything yet.

Nearly 300 kickoffs were returned in the preseason, a 70.5% return rate that was the highest since 2014. Last year’s return rate was 54.8%. There were 18 returns of more than 40 yards, also most since 2014.

The average start for the return team was the 28.8-yard line, an increase of 4.6 yards from 2023 and 4.1 from 2022. The average drive start was the 28 on kickoffs that were returned. Touchbacks result in offenses starting at the 30 this season, part of the major changes designed to increase the number of kickoffs returned after the play essentially became an automatic touchback last year.

Considering the preseason results, teams might be more inclined to just kick into the end zone. Giving up 2 more yards in starting field position probably isn’t worth risking someone breaking a long return.

“I don’t know if there’s a negative right now,” Buccaneers coach Todd Bowles said of the new rules. “There’s not a (large) body of work that everybody went through. There were some kicks that were stoned, there were some kicks that got out. I’m sure everybody didn’t show everything. I don’t know how much we’ve learned.”

Coaches expect kickoffs to evolve more now that the games count. Teams often are reluctant to show their hand in the preseason. Offenses and defenses play vanilla schemes, hold out starters and save their best plans for when it matters most.

That’s no different for special teams coaches.

“There’s probably a lot of people that were holding some stuff close to their vest. They didn’t want to throw anything out there where you could scout in terms of that nature,” Eagles special teams coordinator Michael Clay said.

“The first few weeks are going to be very interesting across the board, not just our opponents but across the league on what everyone is trying to do and trying to gain an advantage. Again, that’s the interesting thing about special teams; you always find the unknown and the uncommon. So we’re going to try and go out there and put our best foot forward.”

Bears special teams coordinator Richard Hightower said most teams used the preseason to evaluate players on kickoffs and had more man-on-man return matchups.

“There is a lot of strategy that hasn’t played out to the public yet,” Hightower said. “It’s a very competitive and strategic play that I think is going to help the team for sure.”

The preseason was an indication that kickers will be more involved in tackling. Kickers had 11.5 tackles plus assists, which was up from four tackles in 2023 and six in 2022.

Unfinished business

Four-time Pro Bowl running back Derrick Henry joined the Baltimore Ravens to be a difference-maker after the team had another disappointing finish in the playoffs.

Lamar Jackson led the Ravens to the best record in the NFL for the second time in five seasons and earned his second MVP award. But Baltimore lost at home to the Chiefs in the AFC title game. The Ravens were knocked out in the divisional round after going 14-2 in 2019 when Jackson won his first MVP award.

For whatever reason, the Ravens abandoned their effective run game in a 17-10 loss to Kansas City last January. Enter Henry, who has rushed for 1,000 yards five times in the past six years.

“That’s exactly why I came here because I knew that the main focus is finishing what they started,” Henry said. “You’re almost there, and I know they want to finally get to that end goal.”

And then there was one

New York Jets edge rusher Haason Reddick is the last player still holding out after All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams reported to the San Francisco 49ers on Tuesday. Reddick, who had 27 sacks over the past two seasons with the Eagles, was traded for a 2026 third-round pick that could become a second if he reaches certain conditions.

Reddick is due to make $14.25 million in base pay this season in the final year of a three-year, $45 million contract. He’s been one of the league’s premier edge rushers and played a major role in helping Philadelphia reach the Super Bowl two years ago.

Getting a deal done and adding Reddick to an already fierce defense would certainly be a significant boost for the Jets, who are hoping Aaron Rodgers can lead them to their first playoff berth since 2010.

League of their own no more

The NFL begins the 2024 season with 15 women holding full-time coaching positions, the most for any male professional sports league. Over the past five years, there has been a 187% increase of women in football operation roles. Twelve of the 15 coaches attended the Women’s Forum, which launched in 2017.

2b71e5821d,BBC.com,How will John Swinney navigate divisions over identity politics? - BBC.com,"Identity politics have proven divisive in the SNP and across the Scottish Parliament. Navigating the issue is one of the major challenges facing Scotland's new first minister.

Both of John Swinney's predecessors, Nicola Sturgeon and Humza Yousaf, spent much political capital in this area.

Ms Sturgeon pursued controversial gender recognition reform legislation, and Mr Yousaf persevered with a subsequent legal challenge after the UK government blocked the new laws.

So far, Mr Swinney has been cautious, saying he will ""wait and see"" what the political landscape is like after the general election when it comes to pursuing gender recognition.

He has described the Cass review into gender identity services for children as a ""significant piece of work"" on a ""complex area of policy"" that should be taken seriously.

He says the Scottish government is committed to legislating on conversion therapy but must now reflect carefully on the responses to a recent consultation on the proposals.

But there is one particularly ideologically and politically-loaded question that's hard for today's politicians to avoid giving a definitive answer.

Nicola Sturgeon previously refused to be drawn and Mr Swinney himself avoided answering it during his leadership campaign launch.

But asked on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme if a transwoman is a woman, Mr Swinney ventured: ""I believe a woman is an adult female born as a woman, and I also accept that transgender women are defined as women.""

His response is unlikely to be satisfactory to either side of the debate - and, with his answer being described by some as confusing, it's likely the FM will face further exploration of his views on this topic.

Eventually Mr Swinney will also have to spell out his government's position on gender policies - and deal with the consequences.

He may hope that by then the general election will have been and gone - an event that marks another major challenge for his premiership.

That challenge is not just about delivering a strong election result in itself but also defining what that result means for the SNP's core aim - Scottish independence.

His strategy is to demonstrate he can deliver a thriving Scottish economy and good public services as a means of convincing more Scots of the case for leaving the union.

But he's also committed to the SNP's policy that winning a majority of seat at the forthcoming election would be a mandate for another push on independence.

What happens if they don't get that majority? The first minister won't countenance that right now but it could have a considerable impact on his own future, as well as that of the independence movement.

Mr Swinney has already made it clear that economic growth is one of his top priorities - and a visit to the ground-breaking for the new Ardersier Port is very much on message.

The project exemplifies investment in the transition from oil and gas to renewables, with government funding boosting private investment.

In that Good Morning Scotland interview, Mr Swinney said: ""I want to make sure that the power of government, which is very significant if aligned properly and aligned effectively, can deliver those approaches that are good and attractive for investors.""

The focus on growth may be music to the ears of the business community but questions remain over exactly how the first minister intends to alter the Scottish government's current approach.

And the devil, as always, is in the detail. Setting that out is another of his major challenges.

Will he address concerns over business rates?

Will ministers look again at tax policy after the Scottish regime was described as ""bewildering"" by the entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter?

And will the current presumption against new oil and gas projects continue?

The answers to those questions remain unclear.",A group of people holding banners and a sign that reads 'A man can't become a woman.

f3bd78adf3,Forbes,What Happens When There May Not Be Enough Jobs To Go Around Due To AI And Automation? - Forbes,"What happens when there may not be enough jobs to go around due to automation and AI advancements? This pressing question demands a fundamental reimagining of education and curriculum design to prepare children for a future when traditional employment may not be the norm. Top global thought leaders—Nick Bostrom, Howard Gardner, Andrew Hargreaves, Charles Fadel, and Michael B. Horn—share insights on what education systems can do about it.

In my recent interview with Bostrom, renowned philosopher and author of Deep Utopia: Life and Meaning in a Solved World, he emphasizes the need for a major change in education to equip individuals with the skills and mindset necessary to thrive in an AI-driven world.

Bostrom's insights underscore the limitations of traditional education models in preparing individuals for the challenges and opportunities presented by AI. He advocates for a more dynamic approach that integrates AI tools into education, fostering adaptability, critical thinking and digital literacy among students.

Personalized Learning And Lifelong Adaptation

Bostrom emphasizes the potential of AI in providing personalized tutorial systems, stating, ""There are great opportunities as well for more personalized tutorial systems using these AI technologies.” Instead of “having one teacher maybe telling a class of 30 students how to do some mathematics thing, you could have systems that understand precisely where each student is at, what they are stuck at, what they get wrong, and then create personalized explanations to help them overcome hurdles."" This approach holds promise in addressing individual learning needs and overcoming educational barriers, thereby maximizing learning outcomes for all students.

Furthermore, lifelong learning has always been important, but the rapid pace of technological change today makes it even more critical. The speed and scale of disruption are unprecedented, affecting nearly every industry worldwide. These changes are revolutionizing the entire frameworks of production, management, and governance.

Bostrom stresses the importance of cultivating a mindset of continuous learning and adaptation. ""I think it might be a useful skill to not think of learning as something you do once at the beginning of your life in school, and then you have done your learning and now you're just kind of coasting on that until you retire,” he says. “I think increasingly we will need to think of our lives as one big ongoing process of learning, a lot of which needs to come not from some external authority telling you 'you have to do it,' but cultivates that kind of mindset of growth and curiosity, I think will also put you in a better position.""

Expert Perspectives On Integrating AI In Education

Charles Fadel, a global education thought leader and futurist, believes what is most important is “modernized knowledge, how we use our knowledge, how we behave and engage in the world, and how we reflect, adapt, and learn how to learn.” Fadel highlights the challenge of implementing these frameworks effectively, noting that ""even the most advanced jurisdictions provide little to no efficacious professional development and no assessment of these competencies.""

Fadel highlights the importance of ethical considerations and warns against over-reliance on AI. The ""cognitive miser"" effect, in which humans prefer easy solutions, can exacerbate dependence on imperfect AI systems. “Simply put, our brains are lazy through good evolutionary design, which means we take the route of least effort every time possible. This leads to over-reliance, which is particularly concerning as these algorithms, like humans, are not perfect, and confabulate with gusto.”

Andy Hargreaves, visiting professor at the University of Ottawa and former president of the International Congress of School Effectiveness, discusses the engagement crisis post-Covid-19 and how AI can help or hinder the drive to reengage students and teachers. ""AI will be a hindrance if it just offers more bad learning in a more efficient, slightly less toxic, and more stylish way. If the driving priority is to make learning more engaging by supporting rather than bypassing the teacher, then there’s a lot to work with.”

Hargreaves also highlights the broader societal implications of AI, emphasizing the need for a fair global tax agreement on wealth generated by AI and robotics. ""If there is no agreed global principle of fair distribution, AI will become our next greedy master, not our servant for a better society.""

Howard Gardner, the John H. and Elisabeth A. Hobbs research professor of cognition and education at Harvard Graduate School of Education, stresses the importance of ethical considerations and cultural sensitivity in integrating AI into education. ""First, of course, do no harm, and if harm is done, try to understand why and avoid it in the future. Second, understand and be sensitive to various cultural norms and practices, including religious and political systems.""

Gardner advocates for a holistic approach to education, likening it to a model of physical health that spans from pediatrics to gerontology. ""Education can and should remain central, but we need to be very open to the form that education will take—from cradle to grave, with new kinds of roles, expertise, and options.""

Michael B. Horn, co-founder of the Clayton Christensen Institute for Disruptive Innovation, offers practical insights on integrating AI tools into the current education system. ""The lowest risk and most immediate opportunity for impact is for AI tools to support teachers in everything from helping them lesson plan to creating more personalized learning opportunities for students in different places in their learning to helping them assess student work."" He emphasizes that supporting teachers is crucial because experts can mitigate AI's occasional hallucinations, reducing the likelihood of misleading students.

Horn also discusses the potential benefits and challenges of implementing personalized tutorial systems using AI in classrooms. ""Tutoring is one of the biggest hypes and excitements around AI. AI tutors are great when there's not another option—more affordable, scalable, and accessible. But not as good as a human tutor, particularly a human tutor with AI at their disposal.""

He highlights the benefits of personalization, such as allowing students to work on concepts at their right level and providing a myriad of examples to help them understand concepts. However, he cautions that AI tutors are not perfect and simple mistakes could mislead students, potentially hurting their confidence and self-efficacy.

Next Steps

Bostrom's insights, along with perspectives from Fadel, Hargreaves, Gardner, and Horn, underscore the need for a fundamental reimagining of education in the AI era. By integrating AI tools into education, fostering adaptability, and addressing ethical considerations, we can better prepare individuals to thrive in an AI-driven future. As we navigate this transformative landscape, policymakers, educators, and stakeholders must collaborate to ensure that education remains a cornerstone of human progress, equipping individuals with the skills and mindset to lead purposeful lives.

Are our current assessment systems, which heavily rely on traditional testing models, adequately evaluating the skills and knowledge needed for success in a rapidly evolving AI-driven world? Is now the time to explore alternative appraisal methods that align with the demands of this new era?","A silhouette of a person stands on a reflective surface overlooking a swirling ocean under a bright light, possibly a sun or moon, with a starry sky above.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BA1E18490>,2024-06-21 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.forbes.com,https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyrubin/2024/06/21/what-happens-when-there-may-not-be-enough-jobs-to-go-around-due-to-automation-and-ai-advancements/,['Technology' 'Other'],[0.85 0.15],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/f3bd78adf3.png
069f41d513,The Washington Post,Opinion | This Fourth: The ‘eve of destruction’? Or an opportunity for optimism? - The Washington Post,"Unphased by this spring’s campus protests, I grew more hopeful about America’s future after attending one commencement ceremony that wasn’t canceled — our granddaughter’s graduation from preschool. Hearing “Eve of Destruction” on the car ride home didn’t dampen my optimism. There are understandable concerns about the nation’s direction, but as bad as things seem today, Barry McGuire’s No. 1 hit from 1965 reminded me we have gotten through worse.

Instead, I was inspired by patriotic toddlers waving flags, singing and sharing their American dreams. Eighteen rising kindergartners, hands over hearts, recited the Pledge of Allegiance. Then, they belted out every lyric of “This Land is Your Land,” Woody Guthrie’s World War II-era anthem adopted by my generation’s antiwar, civil rights activists.

They were like the Lady Liberty inscription dressed in miniature caps and gowns. Sure, not “your tired, your poor, your huddled masses” (a private preschool in one of the nation’s wealthiest counties), but a small world melting pot — not a Mary or John in the bunch.

Several more called into public service: police officer, firefighter, astronaut. Six doctors. One “baby.” A “hospital,” and a financially savvy “plastic surgeon.” Three youngsters surprisingly embraced rewarding, albeit boring, careers as dentists. Another: life in the wild as a tiger. Our granddaughter dreamed big. A natural-born schmoozer, she wisely opted not to follow grandpa’s steps into lobbying. When I questioned why she chose a profession some might consider a stretch, she unhesitatingly, without explanation, doubled down on “unicorn.”

Building a ‘more perfect union’

The Post’s June 30 front-page article “As isolation and pessimism mount, teacher tries to get teens to the polls,” about Shannon Salter’s civics class in Allentown, Pa., paints a powerful portrait. It highlights the challenges that our democracy faces, as well as the challenges that educators face in a society where trust has waned and where the effects of the pandemic linger on schooling. Since the article’s publication, civics educators have told us they feel heard and seen.

The skeptical youth of Allentown, along with the millions who report feeling alienated from institutions, deserve urgent attention. We might well be losing a generation’s desire to help build a “more perfect union.” Young people are withdrawing. They voice disappointment in the future of our country’s prospects in classrooms such as Ms. Salter’s every day. In the post-pandemic environment, our youths need immediate, exciting ways to participate. A solid civic education cultivates a series of habits of citizenship — listening to others, knowing how to disagree productively, discerning truth and, of course, voting. These skills, combined with knowledge and perspective, build agency and hope. Beyond that, we need to give young people opportunities to get involved in our constitutional democracy and show them that it can work. The future of our nation is on the line.

The Post’s excellent article missed a crucial point. Shannon Salter’s students and other nonvoters have seen so many troubles persist for so long that they don’t believe voting can make a difference. However, recent events (especially the Supreme Court’s decisions over the past several years and rising wealth inequality over decades) should make very clear that failing to vote invites backsliding. It needs to be remembered that, when things are bad, they can still get worse. Only after guarding against backsliding can we aspire again to make matters better.

Democracy v. the Supreme Court

During last year’s Fourth of July celebration, my 18-year-old daughter said to me, “Why are we celebrating July Fourth? Our country is so messed up.” I was very annoyed with her for not being patriotic. The Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity, however, has caused me to agree with her.

The decision, disguised in legal scholarship, demonstrates the court’s partisan ideology. Justice Neil M. Gorsuch said this will be a decision for the ages, but it’s clear that this decision is for the benefit of one person: Donald Trump. The court said a president deserves the presumption of innocence for official acts, regardless of the intent or benefit from that act. In practical terms, this could mean a president appoints a foreign ambassador, an official act, on a bribe. It could mean Mr. Trump’s actions — telling the Justice Department to conduct investigations into bogus claims of election fraud or telling states to submit fake electors — are considered official acts.

To quote Justice Sonia Sotomayor in her dissenting opinion: “This new official-acts immunity now ‘lies about like a loaded weapon,’ for any President that wishes to place his own interests, his own political survival, or his own financial gain, above the interests of the Nation.” The irony here is that the Supreme Court decision seems to be saying that a president’s actions must be protected from a vindictive successor — yet, this rule could protect Mr. Trump, who publicly vowed to prosecute his successor, if he becomes a vindictive successor.

The court has violated a cornerstone of democracy, that no one is above the law. It is a devastating blow to our form of government. The days of holding a president accountable, as we did with Richard M. Nixon, are gone. The imperial presidency is now officially here.

Salvatore Misuraca, Washington

Americans must immediately move to protect our democracy and the rule of law. Two constitutional amendments are desperately needed. The first would reverse the Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity and clarify that presidents and all public officials are equal before the law, not immune from prosecution and conviction. The second would clarify the right of all Americans to vote in free and fair elections that are not dominated by the power of money.

This will require both great leadership and vigorous grass-roots organizing. Legal and political leaders — such as Judge J. Michael Luttig, retired justice Stephen G. Breyer, former representative Liz Cheney and former Georgia representative Stacey Abrams — should quickly draft bipartisan constitutional amendments along these lines. This must be linked to a broad-based campaign involving millions of Americans in joining to protect our rights by using the democratic procedures for amending the Constitution that our Founding Fathers provided to protect the soul of America.

You don’t have to travel to Utah to see spectacular firefly displays. You can come to Laytonsville, Md.

Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India on Aug. 5, had banned the party as a “militant and terrorist” organization and blamed its student wing and other associate bodies for inciting chaos over a quota system for government jobs. The weeks of violent protests and Hasina’s crackdown left more than 600 people dead, according to U.N. estimates.

The Ministry of Home Affairs repealed the ban on Wednesday, paving the way for the party to resume its activities. It still needs to register with the Election Commission to contest polls.

There was no immediate reaction from the party leadership. Jamaat-e Islami has been banned from taking part in elections since 2013, after the Election Commission canceled its registration, a decision upheld by the High Court, which ruled that the party’s charter violated the constitution by opposing secularism.

Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, secretary-general of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, Hasina’s rival, also had blamed Hasina’s government for the ban that he said was meant to divert attention from the violence in which security officials were accused of using excessive force and causing deaths among protesters.

The Yunus-led government has been struggling to restore political stability and order as police forces and other government sectors are demoralized after attacks by protesters. Compounding the crisis was a devastating flash flood that ravaged the country’s eastern and other regions, killing at least 27 people.

Under Hasina, who was criticized as an authoritarian, thousands of opposition leaders and activists were arrested before the January election that returned her to power for the fourth consecutive term. Human rights groups blamed her for using security forces and courts to suppress the opposition, the charge she denies.

75045aba26,Financial Times,The toxic politicisation of financial regulation - Financial Times,"With the UK and the US in full-on electioneering mode over the coming months, we can expect plenty of noise about push-button voter issues: the cost of living, immigration and a familiar range of “culture-war” topics.

But in among the talk of cutting taxes, and stopping boats and border crossings, you may also find senior party figures, even the leadership contenders, broaching the more rarefied subjects of financial regulation and central banking.

One of the most abstruse examples came in the UK’s 2022 Tory party leadership race, when Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak puzzled observers by talking in mainstream televised debates about esoteric financial regulations — in particular their rival plans to remove Solvency II insurance regulations and “unshackle” the City of London from pre-Brexit EU rules on capital safety.

The trend has been ramping up for a while. Since the 2008 financial crisis triggered a global regulatory crackdown, the rule books that govern the world’s banks, insurers and asset managers have been drawn into ideological splits between Republicans and Democrats, and Conservative and Labour in a similar way to gender identity and climate change.

Back in 2010, when Dodd-Frank legislation to make banks safer was passed under Barack Obama’s US presidency, it included the creation of a new high-ranking financial regulation position at the Federal Reserve. Ironically, though, the first appointee to the role of vice-chair of supervision was not made until Donald Trump’s first term of office, and swung the pendulum towards deregulation: Randy Quarles lightened the burden on regional banks, including the likes of SVB and First Republic, which duly collapsed last year.

More infamously Trump openly sought to influence the Fed, when he repeatedly threatened to remove chair Jay Powell and demanded aggressive rate cuts. As Trump limbers up for his second run at the White House, aides have been drawing up alarming plans to seize direct control of the Fed.

In the UK, too, political interference in supposedly independent financial policymaking has been on the increase. Last month, in an interview with the Financial Times, chancellor Jeremy Hunt publicly rebuked the latest policy initiative from Nikhil Rathi, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority. “I hope the FCA re-look at their decision,” Hunt said, referring to the regulator’s plan to announce the identities of institutions it is investigating before it finds wrongdoing.

In many cases, it is hard to measure quite how much real impact loud-mouthed or arm-twisting politicians have on policymaking. But in the US — where the leadership of key regulators has long flip-flopped between Democrat or Republican control depending on who is in the White House — there is one ongoing fight that could prove extremely consequential.

Last week, Marty Gruenberg, the Democrat chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, an important banking supervisor, tendered his resignation. On the face of it, the departure has nothing to do with politics, coming on the back of a workplace culture review that found Gruenberg presided over a “misogynistic” organisation. The Wall Street Journal last year published an investigation into sexual harassment and bullying at the organisation.

But the affair, whether politicised from the start or not, certainly is now. Only with Gruenberg in place does the FDIC board have a 3-2 Democrat majority to push through a tougher set of bank capital requirements, dubbed the Basel III Endgame, over the coming months. Republicans, echoing the protests of Wall Street, have opposed the new rules (already watered down by the Fed). So far, Gruenberg seems to have outsmarted his critics, specifying that his resignation will apply only once a successor is anointed. Late last week, Republicans asked Gruenberg to appear at a congressional hearing for the second time in a month.

“The Republicans won’t give up until they force Gruenberg out and install the Republican vice-chair,” says Dennis Kelleher, who heads the Better Markets campaign group. Such an outcome could not only scupper bank capital rules designed to make still-fragile regional banks safer, as well as buttressing the giants of Wall Street. But at a time when Joe Biden is trailing Trump in key states extra publicity for a scandal involving a key regulatory ally like Gruenberg could also further damage the president’s re-election hopes. Politicised regulation cuts both ways.

01e3f82f5f,Fox News,"Jordan Peterson slams ‘carnivorous, bureaucratic, moralizing dimwits’ behind his mandated sensitivity training - Fox News","This story is the second part in a series from a candid conversation Dr. Jordan Peterson had with Fox News Digital. Read the first part here.

Canadian psychologist and best-selling author Dr. Jordan Peterson vowed to keep speaking his unfiltered opinion despite a court order to attend sensitivity training following complaints over his social media posts.

Peterson spoke about his ongoing free speech battle against the Ontario College of Psychologists, which last year ordered him to take ""social media training"" for his posts calling out transgender ideology, politicians and other polarizing topics. Several Ontario Divisional Court judges rejected his appeal, but the intellectual said he would keep fighting and that the people behind the order would not have an easy time silencing him.

""I'm not concerned about it because there's nothing they can really do to me,"" Peterson told Fox News Digital.

JORDAN PETERSON PLANS TO BROADCAST COURT-ORDERED SOCIAL MEDIA TRAINING: ‘LET THE PUBLIC DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES’

Peterson said it appears he will have to undergo the training after all, but he still plans on appealing again. If that fails, he said he will continue to be as defiant and vocal as he ever was on these topics.

""My feet are being held to the fire, let's say, by the Ontario College of Psychologists. Well, right now their plan is to re-educate me,"" he said. ""However, I've taken legal action to forestall that. I lost the first appeal. Let's say I have one more to the Supreme Court. Will that be successful? I doubt it.""

""And if it isn't? Well, then I have to undergo reeducation,"" Peterson continued. ""So, I’ll cross that bridge when I come to it, but I don't suspect that the re-education process will go the way that the people who are planning it think it will go.""

The psychologist sent a warning to the bureaucrat who ends up personally overseeing his ""re-education."" He said that person would be ""foolish"" to take up the job and promised to make the entire process ""as public as possible.""

The prominent psychologist’s outspoken statements against far-left and woke agendas have gotten him in hot water on multiple occasions. Prior to being ordered to attend social media training, he was suspended from Twitter in 2022 — Elon Musk bought it and renamed the platform X — for rebuking transgender actor Elliot Page.

""Remember when pride was a sin? And Ellen Page just had her breasts removed by a criminal physician,"" Peterson posted at the time. He was let back onto the platform after Musk took over the company.

That same year, Peterson also criticized Sports Illustrated for featuring a plus-sized model on its May cover.

""Sorry. Not beautiful. And no amount of authoritarian tolerance is going to change that,"" he posted.

For those posts and similar ones, the College of Psychologists of Ontario ordered Peterson to undergo the training or risk losing his license to practice psychology in the province. Peterson's appeal of the decision was rejected.

Peterson told Fox News Digital that sitting through the training is the ""most likely outcome.""

""The clear plan of the Ontario College of Psychologists is to destroy my reputation and to take my license,"" he said. ""That's their plan, clearly, clearly. They continue to bring up charges against me. So they haven't backed off in the least.""

The psychologist also said he finds the entire process annoying, calling it ""super expensive"" and ""a waste of time.""

DR. JORDAN PETERSON AIRS PRIDE MONTH GRIEVANCES, SAYS ‘CELEBRATION OF SEXUALITY’ IS NAMED AFTER CARDINAL SIN

""Fundamentally, I'm not concerned about it because there's nothing they can really do to me,"" Peterson said. ""You know, I'm not practicing as a clinical psychologist. I don't have clients. And so, I'm not financially dependent on the designation.""

""And truly, I'm so appalled by my colleagues and their cowardice in the face of the gender-affirming care idiocy that it isn't even a club I want to belong to,"" he continued.

However, Peterson did lament the possibility of being forced to give up something he worked so hard to earn.

""I'm not willing to let a pack of carnivorous, bureaucratic, moralizing dimwits strip me of something that I earned and did well at,"" he said. ""So, we'll see how it goes.""

The College of Psychologists of Ontario did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

71240a5661,HuffPost,Here's When You Should Start Talking To Your Kid About Puberty - HuffPost,"I was a kid who couldn’t wait to grow up. I was fascinated by teenagers, read every Judy Blume book in my elementary school library and was thrilled when, in the summer after fifth grade, my mom packed maxi pads in my camp bag “just in case.” She had gotten her period at 11 and told me it was possible that I would as well.

But much to my disappointment, those just-in-case pads weren’t needed that summer, or even the one after that. Despite what I had hoped, I didn’t get my period until the incredibly average age of 13.

Nevertheless, plenty of kids do start puberty on the early side, whether they want to or not, and talking to them about what is on the horizon well before this happens is a key part of helping them grow up confident, informed and safe.

When should puberty talks begin?

Puberty may start earlier than many adults expect. This is partly due to the fact that the age of pubertal onset has been decreasing over the past few decades. Children today may begin puberty, indicated by breast development and testicular enlargement, at ages as young as 8 for those assigned female at birth and 9 for those assigned male at birth. Starting before these ages is generally categorized as precocious puberty, a condition that affects approximately 1% of the population.

This changing puberty landscape is one of the many reasons that proactive discussions are needed. In my house, those conversations have been happening since my kids were toddlers. They started with naming body parts and continued with more and more information about how those parts would develop as they got older.

For David Hu, a professor at Georgia Tech and the author of “The P Word,” a children’s book about penises, conversations in his family also started when his children were relatively young.

“My kids are 12 and 13, and we started talking about puberty on and off over the years,” he said. “When they were 6-8, they asked why their bodies were different than adult bodies. Then when we started to see the signs, we talked about it regularly.”

Contrary to common fears, discussing puberty with children before physical changes occur isn’t going to harm them. Sure, it might be a little awkward, but awkwardness is a small price to pay for the benefits that come with filling in information gaps and allaying fears and worries.

Plus, parents should know they don’t have to make up a script on the fly. There is a lot of support available for caregivers. For example, the website Sex Positive Families has an excellent resource section that breaks down topics by age, and the organization Amaze, which produces puberty and sex education videos, has a playlist geared toward children ages 4 to 9 and their parents.

Talking is protective.

Beyond personal preparation, discussing puberty with young kids has a number of other benefits. Lori Reichel, a health educator and host of “The Puberty Prof” podcast, emphasizes that early conversations lay the groundwork for increasingly complex later ones.

“If we can’t talk about basic stuff with kids, then how will they come to us when things get more challenging in the future?” she said. “Say, if they are thinking of having sex or if they have questions about their identity?”

Additionally, having open conversations with young kids is one of the ways we can help protect them from potential sexual abuse. Everyday conversations about the sexual and reproductive organs help kids learn that talking about those parts is not taboo and that they have trusted adults they can turn to if problems arise or boundaries are crossed.

Overall, discussing puberty with children in a supportive and informative manner can empower them, strengthen their ability to recognize inappropriate behavior and foster healthy relationships built on trust and communication.

The benefits of inclusive language.

When discussing puberty, aim to use inclusive language whenever possible. Often adults try to reassure kids by saying things like, “Don’t worry, all girls will get their periods during puberty,” or “As a boy, you’ll experience changes like growing facial hair and having a deep voice.” However, it’s important to understand that such blanket statements can inadvertently exclude children who are transgender, intersex or have certain medical conditions.

Transgender and gender-diverse kids might have questions about how puberty applies to them. So it’s essential to clarify that, regardless of gender identity, individuals with uteruses, ovaries and vaginas can experience menstruation, while those with testicles and penises can produce sperm.

It is also really important to include kids with physical disabilities, medical conditions or cognitive delays in puberty conversations. Consulting with a specialist who understands your child’s situation can help you and them prepare for the changes and know how to deal with them.

Similarly, for parents and caregivers of neurodiverse kids, thinking about how to talk about puberty before diving into the conversation can be a game changer. Victoria Ellen Whiting is a neurodiverse author who wrote “The Autistic Guide to Puberty: A Practical Survival Handbook” to fill what she saw as a gap in autistic resources. She advises parents to remember that just as every autistic person is different, so too will be the puberty experiences of individual kids on the spectrum. As a result, she explained, a lot of figuring out what works for your child will be through trial and error.

“Just be prepared for things not to go as planned. Autistic traits can be heightened during puberty, so make yourself aware of resources which can help you (and your child) to navigate puberty,” she said.

All children will benefit from inclusive conversations about puberty. But for some kids, particularly those with diverse or marginalized identities, or children with distinct needs, this practice is crucial.

Navigating the unknown can be overwhelming for children, especially when what is unknown is what is happening to their bodies. But as Hu said, “Talking about puberty is like commenting on the weather. Both are in a constant state of change, but both affect what they will wear today.”",Two teenagers with backpacks are seen walking together in a park with trees and a clear sky in the background.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x117 at 0x7D6B7F027580>,2024-07-05 09:00:43+00:00,https://www.huffpost.com,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/when-you-should-start-talking-to-your-kid-about-puberty_l_667b0424e4b05521a7efcad2,['Health' 'Other'],[0.9 0.1],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/71240a5661.png
698bc6d361,National Review,The Stunning Arrogance of the Biden DOJ’s Response to Judge Cannon’s Dismissal - National Review,"Author’s Note: Last Saturday (July 13), I published the first piece in what was to be a two-part series on the status of the federal prosecution of Donald Trump in Florida, in which Biden Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith charged the former president with 32 counts of illegally retaining classified documents and eight counts of obstruction. I have since had to overhaul part two because on Monday (July 15), Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the case, ruling that Smith’s appointment as a special counsel violated the Constitution’s appointment’s clause. Rather than promptly restart the case by reassigning it to a district U.S. attorney, Biden attorney general Merrick Garland has approved an appeal of Judge Cannon’s ruling. What follows is a discussion of the prosecution’s status in light of that decision.

The Democratic narrative about Donald Trump is that he is reckless and temperamentally unfit for the presidency. My own view is that Trump has a mercurial streak and is a social-media blowhard, but that he’s actually sheepish when it comes to action — relying on legal advisers to know when to ignore his outbursts (Fire Mueller!) and to implement policies that, unlike Biden’s usurpations, stay within constitutional and statutory boundaries.

Of course, I get the January 6 retort to that critique. In the end, though, Trump never even tried to recruit the armed forces into his shenanigans, he backed down after a little resistance to the cockamamie effort to pull his Justice Department into these machinations, and he couldn’t be charged in the Capitol riot by Biden Justice Department prosecutors — and God knows they tried — because he didn’t actually direct violent resistance, much to the chagrin of rabble-rousers who expected him to call them into service as a militia.

Biden, on the other hand, is reckless. And his chief legal adviser, Attorney General Merrick Garland, isn’t helping.

Not surprisingly, the Biden DOJ has announced that it will appeal Judge Aileen Cannon’s dismissal of the Mar-a-Lago documents indictment against Trump. In a thoughtful 93-page opinion, which our Dan McLaughlin outlined on Monday, Judge Cannon of the Florida federal district court held that Smith’s appointment violated the Constitution’s appointments clause.

As I’ve explained here and here, I believe this is the correct interpretation of the Constitution. I am not saying there are not colorable counterarguments (in particular, the question of whether a passage in United States v. Nixon (1974) is dictum or binding precedent). But it should not be deniable by reasonable people that Cannon’s view is at least arguably sound. Her opinion echoes the views expressed by Justice Clarence Thomas in his immunity-case concurrence just two weeks ago, as well as the views of former attorneys general Ed Meese and Michael Mukasey, among other legal luminaries who filed amicus briefs in the Florida case. (Judge Mukasey explained his position in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed.)

I point this out to demonstrate how unreasonable and arrogant the Biden administration is. The Justice Department could easily have accounted for this contingency and made adjustments that would have cost the DOJ nothing — adjustments that any normal, competent U.S. attorney’s office would have made.

What if Judge Cannon is wrong? So what? News flash: Judges get stuff wrong from time to time. More to the point, competent federal prosecutors anticipate where judges may misstep — or, at least, arguably misstep — and plan accordingly.

A big part of a judge’s job is to vindicate the constitutional presumptions in favor of the defendant. Hence, competent prosecutors must anticipate that judges are going to rule against them on many close calls — e.g., whether a warrant is required, whether Miranda warnings should have been given, whether information in government files that could endanger witnesses must be disclosed, whether some privilege bars the prosecution from obtaining evidence from a particular source, and so on. If prosecutors want to move their case along efficiently, they must be prepared for the not-unforeseeable prospect that the judge will rule against them.

In a normal prosecutor’s office, then, the discussion is not along the lines of, “Screw the judge, we’re going to do what we think is right”; since the judge is in charge of the legal proceeding, that’s how you lose the case. Instead, the prosecutors’ deliberations are along the lines of, “What Plan B, if we lose on this one, will enable us to live with the ruling, to get what we need even if we can’t get everything we think we’re entitled to?”

In his formal appointment order (see here, paragraph (e)), Garland invoked §600.6 in vesting Smith with “the full power and independent authority to exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions of any United States Attorney.” That means Smith was to exercise the powers of an officer of the United States. Judge Cannon did not resolve the vexing question of whether this power — equivalent to that of a district U.S. attorney — is that of a principal or inferior officer of the United States. But either way, Smith is ineligible.

Under the appointments clause, principal officers must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate; inferior officers must serve in positions created by statute and must qualify in accordance with what the statute requires (which is often Senate confirmation). Smith was not presidentially nominated and Senate confirmed, nor does he serve in a position created by statute — he was appointed under a regulation decreed by the Clinton Justice Department.

Regulations are not statutes and cannot alter the Constitution’s requirements. Ergo, Smith does not qualify. Certainly, it should be easy for reasonable people to say, “Yeah, I know these regs have been on the books for 25 years, but there sure seems to be a significant question about whether the regulations under which Smith was appointed are valid.”

It would thus be the height of arrogance for a prosecutor’s office to decide there was no way a judge would find Smith’s appointment to be constitutionally infirm — at least once the prosecutor’s office knew the defense would make such a challenge.

I point this out because, as I’ve noted about a million times, there was no basis to appoint a special counsel in this case. There was no conflict of interest between the Biden Justice Department and Trump that required such an appointment (which is no doubt why Garland conveniently omitted from Smith’s appointment order §600.1, which stipulates that “a conflict of interest for the Department [of Justice]” is among the “grounds for appointing a special counsel”).

The Biden Justice Department was investigating Trump for nearly two years before Garland’s appointment of Smith. There was no conflict.

Smith was thus appointed for political reasons, not because the law dictated it. Biden and Garland were trying to create the illusion that the president and his Justice Department had nothing to do with the prosecution of the president’s opponent in the upcoming election. But the illusion is constitutionally absurd. Federal prosecutorial power is vested in the president, who exercises it through the attorney general and the Justice Department. A prosecutor — whether Garland, a district U.S. attorney, or Smith — has no power; he is delegated to exercise the president’s power at the president’s pleasure.

The normal, easy way for the Justice Department to investigate and prosecute Trump would have been to assign the case to the U.S. attorney’s office in the appropriate district. In the Mar-a-Lago documents case, that would have been the Southern District of Florida (SD-Fla). That office could have worked the case in conjunction with the Justice Department’s National Security Division because the case involves highly classified information.

But Garland wouldn’t do that because the SD-Fla U.S. attorney’s office and the National Security Division are components of the Biden Justice Department, and Garland wanted everyone to pretend that Biden and his DOJ were insulated from the prosecution of Trump.

Maybe this charade would have been tenable if there hadn’t been a serious challenge to Smith’s appointment. In some prior special-counsel cases — for example, Robert Mueller’s prosecution of Paul Manafort — it is not clear that the defense challenged the constitutionality of the special counsel’s appointment. And there is a D.C. Circuit case in which such a challenge was rejected — although, as I’ve related, that case (a) did not seriously grapple with the constitutional questions raised and (b) is not binding on federal courts in Florida.

Once it was clear, however, that there would be a serious constitutional challenge to Smith’s appointment, it was incumbent on a responsible Justice Department to make contingency plans. Here, all Garland had to do was transfer the case to the supervision of the U.S. attorney in SD-Fla (or to any other of the 94 presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed district U.S. attorneys in the country). Substantively, nothing would have changed. Smith could still have been in charge, and his staff could still have been running the case. It’s just that they would technically have been under the SD-Fla U.S. attorney in the chain-of-command.

That would just have been an on-paper change. But it would have left Trump with no basis to challenge the constitutional validity of the case brought by Jack Smith as a prosecutor. Garland, however, mulishly resisted making this easy tweak because to make it would be to admit that the Biden Justice Department is using the president’s power to prosecute the president’s opponent — as if pretending this unavoidable fact is not a fact makes it any less a fact.

And now, rather than just making that easy change, the Biden Justice Department is going to appeal Cannon’s ruling — meaning it will go to the Eleventh Circuit (where I believe DOJ is likely to lose) and then to the Supreme Court (where it is also likely to lose).

If Garland and Smith stick with that plan, it will take at least a year to sort this out. If Garland had a reasonable person whispering in his ear, that person would say, “If you are still the attorney general at that point, it’s very likely you will be in exactly the same position you are in today. So why not forget the appeal and make the easy fix today?”

In a column on Monday, I appealed to President Biden to end the lawfare against former President Trump. Doing so would be good for the country and would reward Biden politically. Obviously, then, I would be glad to see the Florida prosecution fade away. Since it’s not fading away, though, note the following.

Garland could easily get the Florida prosecution of Trump up and running in just a few days. All the AG would need to do is assign the case to a district U.S. attorney. Even if it turned out that Smith would rather resign than accept the transfer (which I doubt), certainly his staffers — who have spent a couple of years working the case — would accept the AG’s order transferring them to that U.S. attorney’s supervision. It would not change their day-to-day duties, and it would not require any meaningful delay in the case. To the contrary, if they were prudent, they’d use the opportunity to file an indictment that slimmed the case down to the obstruction counts. That would obviate the need to slog through the classified-documents litigation that has slowed the pace of pretrial proceedings to a crawl.

Instead, Garland is appealing. Rather than conceding that Judge Cannon has a point — which she undoubtedly does, even if you’re not convinced that she’s right — the Biden approach, echoed by the media–Democrat complex, will be to rant that Cannon is a Trump appointee, as if innuendo explained everything.

The facts, however, are that (a) the Florida case was bogged down because Smith grossly overcharged it, larding it with not one but 32 Espionage Act counts (at the same time Garland was ensuring that Biden would face no Espionage Act counts for his decades-long illegal retention of classified documents); and (b) Garland will now further needlessly bog the matter down with an appeal he is likely to lose a year or more from now, when he could instead just assign the case to a Biden-appointed district U.S. attorney and keep it moving.

I happen to think Judge Cannon is right about the appointments clause. But even if she’s wrong, she’s not nearly as wrong as the attorney general – whose reasoning can only be explained by partisan politics.","An older man with grey hair and glasses is speaking into a microphone.

63778c077a,CNN,Election officials in battleground Michigan grapple with sweeping voting changes and a presidential election - CNN,"This year, voting will be far easier for Michigan residents – thanks to new laws that establish early voting, automatically send out absentee ballots to voters who requested them and mandate that every community has least one drop box in which to return those ballots.

But the changes have made running elections in this crucial presidential battleground much harder – leading some to worry about burnout among the state’s more than 1,500 local clerks, who must juggle increasingly complex election responsibilities with other duties, ranging from town record-keeping to licensing pets.

“We just put a Ferrari engine inside a Model T car,” Michael Siegrist, the clerk of Canton Township, said of the sweeping effort to modernize elections in a state that still conducts balloting under a decades-old, hyperlocal system.

The scramble to implement Michigan’s new voting rules also comes in a highly charged climate under which a simple mishap could fuel fresh – and false – conspiracy theories about election fraud.

In the 2020 general election, human error in the Republican stronghold of Antrim County in northern Michigan briefly led to the unofficial results showing Joe Biden ahead when Donald Trump had won the county. Despite assurances from state and local election officials that no foul play was involved, the situation quickly spiraled, with Trump allies attempting to cast doubts about Biden’s victory by making meritless claims that tabulators had switched votes from Trump to Biden.

The state’s highly decentralized system of administering voting means that “Michigan has 1,500 elections every big election day,” said Kyle Whitney, the city clerk of Marquette in the state’s Upper Peninsula. That helps ensure that balloting and vote-counting is secure because it’s impossible, he said, to “do one thing en masse that could influence the election on a large scale.”

“That said, the drawback is that we have 1,500 local clerks running elections, and we are much more likely to have … dumb mistakes because clerks are undertrained or overtired,” Whitney said.

The changes are also playing out at a time of higher turnover in the field – as election officials leave their jobs because they have either reached retirement age or face heavier workloads or can no longer tolerate the threats and abuse directed at them since the 2020 election.

A recent national survey of election officials by the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice found that 1 in 5 said they were unlikely to stay in their posts through the 2026 midterm elections.

‘We’re all beginners’

The new rules in Michigan flow from a constitutional amendment that state voters approved by a wide margin in 2022 that dramatically expanded access to voting. For the first time, Michigan now requires nine days of early, in-person voting.

The voter-approved amendment also allows Michiganders to sign up to automatically receive absentee ballots for all future elections. Each community must also have at least one secure ballot drop box, and larger communities must have one for every 15,000 people.

Additionally, the new rules give absentee voters until 5 p.m. on the Friday after the election to fix any clerical errors on their ballots. Ballots cast by military and overseas voters, meanwhile, must now be counted if received within six days after the election, as long as they are postmarked by Election Day.

The 2022 voter amendment, known as Prop 2, built on a constitutional amendment approved in 2018 that allowed any Michigander to apply to vote absentee without needing an excuse. The earlier amendment also established that residents could register to vote on Election Day.

The broad changes have led to a significant workload expansion for the mix of appointed and elected city and town clerks who oversee voting in the Wolverine State.

“It’s almost like running three separate elections now,” Lori Miller, the clerk for Livonia in the Detroit suburbs, said of her new responsibilities. Miller was elected to succeed the previous, term-limited clerk and is overseeing her first presidential election. She previously served as the town’s deputy clerk.

Like other Michigan officials, Miller witnessed the drama that engulfed the 2020 election. At one point, Republicans on the board responsible for signing off on that year’s results in Wayne County, which includes Detroit and Livonia, initially refused to certify Biden’s win. They relented several hours later.

But Miller said she felt she owed it to the community where she has lived all her life to take on the role, despite the challenges. “It’s not a job you can learn in 30 days,” she said.

Deborah Pellow, the part-time clerk of rural Tilden Township in the Upper Peninsula, is also overseeing her first presidential election this year. Pellow has had a long public service career, serving as township treasurer and supervisor along with a decadelong stint as a county commissioner, along with other roles.

But, she said, “this is the hardest and most time-consuming of all the positions I have ever held in the last 30-plus years” as she balances the election demands with other responsibilities, which include bookkeeping, communications and grant-writing for this community of a little more than 1,000 people.

Pellow earns $10,800 a year and said she is working double the hours she initially planned to keep up with her duties.

Even longtime clerks say the learning curve has been steep.

Although voters approved the new rules in November 2022, the state Legislature needed to pass legislation to make them law. That was finalized in July 2023, leaving just a few months for the state to roll out the changes – including a suite of new software – before Michigan’s February 27 presidential primary.

Siegrist, the clerk in Canton, said the time crunch was so intense that he learned the new electronic poll books required for early voting just two hours before he had to train poll workers how to use them.

“I exited 2022 feeling like an expert in election administration and process and procedure,” said Siegrist, an elected Democrat who has served as township clerk since 2016.

“Now, I’m a beginner, and what’s hard is we’re all beginners,” he added.

The February primary was like “drinking from the firehose,” according to Adam Wit, the clerk of Harrison Township – a community of some 23,000 people about 25 miles northeast of Detroit. Wit, a Republican, was first elected in 2012.

“There was new information, new policies, new procedures,” he said. “But failure doesn’t work, so clerks just spent the time, whether it was extra hours on the weekend or long days,” to carry out the election.

Officials with Promote the Vote – the coalition of voting and civil rights groups and individuals behind Michigan’s 2018 and 2020 referenda – said state voters delivered a clear mandate that the election system now must deliver on.

“There’s no doubt that all of these pro-voter changes have created a lot of work for clerks,” said Shira Roza, the group’s election protection director. “We are so grateful to them.”

But, she added, “Michiganders have a fundamental right to vote. … That isn’t very meaningful if you don’t have an opportunity to cast a ballot, and voting on Election Day doesn’t work for everyone.”

Clerks ‘will get it done’

State officials say they have worked hard to train and support clerks, including with $30 million in one-time grant money to help them implement the new laws. A pilot program last fall gave some clerks the chance to experiment with the new rules and technology ahead of the primary.

Angela Benander, a spokeswoman for Michigan’s Democratic secretary of state, Joycelyn Benson, said the agency is also urging legislators to provide additional funding to help clerks carry out their responsibilities moving forward.

Ann Arbor City Clerk Jacqueline Beaudry, who is president of the Michigan Association of Municipal Clerks, said her group is also advocating that local governments increase salaries and staff to help clerks navigate the changes and compensate them adequately for the additional work.

Benander and the clerks interviewed by CNN said February’s balloting in the presidential primary went smoothly in the end. The next big test for Michigan comes in August, when voters cast primary ballots for congressional, state and local offices.

“We are confident that the clerks who are always so professional and dedicated to their jobs will get it done,” Benander said.

Pellow, the clerk in Tilden, agreed, saying her job is to help people vote “anyway we can,” no matter the trials.

“The people of the state of Michigan voted for this,” she said. “Whether it’s more work or not, we have to live with that. As I tell my workers, ‘We’re going to put a smile on our face and thank people for voting because that’s what we are here to do.’”","An elderly man in a blue jacket is seen bending over a table with several voting booths in the background, suggesting a setting of a polling station.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA0E36020>,2024-05-20 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/20/politics/michigan-elections-voting-changes/index.html,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.8 ],Unlikely,Likely,sample_review/images/63778c077a.png
3460a6f047,HuffPost,I Was Stuck In A Toxic Situationship. I Thought He Was The Problem — Until I Had A Frightening Realization. - HuffPost,"I was curled up on my couch. My face twisted in a grimace. One hand rested on my lower abdomen, acting as a makeshift heating pad to soothe the unending purple nurple assaulting my uterus.

Claire, this has to stop.

I groaned.

I felt alone and scared. That feeling started when my gynecologist, Elizabeth, called four days before. She said, “Your pap smear came back abnormal, which isn’t concerning. Every woman has an abnormal pap at least once in her life.” Elizabeth had the bubbly, positive enthusiasm of a cheerleader, pepping the crowd up for the homecoming game. I wanted to believe her, however, at 37 years old, this was my first abnormal pap smear.

I was married straight out of college and divorced nine years later. While my ex-husband and I had our issues, infidelity wasn’t one. My marriage was the tower that protected my vagina from the dangers lurking outside the castle wall. Only one prince had access. Now divorced for a year and a half, I had encountered a few wannabe princes, but mostly frogs. An abnormal pap was extremely concerning.

Elizabeth took in a sharp breath. “There was something else.”

My stomach lurched. I’ve been having lady issues (I’ll spare you the details) for the past three months. All the workups so far had been negative. There was only one stone left unturned.

“We need to bring you in for a biopsy,” Elizabeth flipped that remaining rock right over.

I took a quick inhale, choking on the now-exposed dirt. I couldn’t speak.

“I promise you don’t have cancer, though! I know you don’t,” Elizabeth explained with carefree confidence, still the optimistic cheerleader. “I know you’re worried, so I’m gonna schedule you ASAP.”

After we hung up, I was alone with my anxiety. I wanted to call someone to stop the doomsday spiral in my mind. Mom would be an obvious choice, but she had passed away 12 years ago. Given that the topic was my nether region, I wasn’t going to contact my dad or brother. I texted my two best friends. Their “of course you don’t have cancer” texts helped a little, but I needed more. Because I was single, I had no boyfriend to hold my hand, look me in the eyes and tell me everything would be OK.

Advertisement

The only person who remotely fit the bill of a pseudo-boyfriend was Patrick, the guy I referred to as “My F-boy.”

We met on Bumble … sort of. He “liked” me, and rather than like him back and match, I decided to scope out his IG since his handle was on his profile. Shortly after I followed him, I got a DM from him.

Heyy I know youuu?

Haha not exactly… you liked me on Bumble, you had your insta in your bio so…🤷♀️

So you didn’t like me back but followed me on ig hmmm lol Watsuppp :)

Yup… the 24 hr window to start a convo is a lot of pressure. This seemed easier and it’s working out fine so far.

Lmaoo that’s hilarious

That exchange started almost a year and a half… something? “Relationship” implies far more of an emotional connection than we had. “Situationship” is closer ― but we didn’t have enough physical contact to even reach situationship status. We only saw each other in person three times in total. The reality was that we were sexting pen pals.

I told myself our situation was fine because it was just fun, and I had no feelings for him. Did I cry when he ghosted me? Maybe a couple of times (or every time, who’s counting?) That didn’t mean I liked him. Because I most certainly did not.

Advertisement

And I absolutely did not get any validation from his attention. I never posted a single picture to my Instagram story wearing an outfit he would like. Which is why I didn’t care when he responded to said stories with multiple heart-eye emojis and pleas to see me. My confidence and ego didn’t care how many times he told me I was pretty. You would never catch me smiling like an idiot at my phone reading his messages. I had full control over the situation.

And I never sent any full or partial nudity. It was no different than if someone saw me at the beach in a bikini… except for the exaggerated arch of my back to pop my butt up just the way he liked.

Occasionally, I had fleeting moments of clarity and honesty with myself. What Patrick and I were doing was weird and ridiculous. I would get bored of his dick pics and hollow promises of foreplay, especially when we’d make plans to see each other, and he would bail or completely disappear at the last minute. I’d block him, cutting him off cold. Then a day would come when I was bored or feeling extra lonely, and my thoughts would turn to Patrick.

Hmm… I wonder what he’s up to.

Within a few hours of unblocking, I’d have a message from him. He never asked why I had blocked him or was upset with me about it. He was just happy to be back. Our unspoken agreement was that we could dip in and out of each other’s lives without explanation. We both knew the other would be there when we eventually wanted to return. Patrick and I enjoyed the daily companionship of a relationship without the responsibilities or obligations of an actual relationship.

We didn’t need in-depth emotional conversations to figure each other out. The sheer volume of our communication built a bond in a slow yet imperceptible way. We both knew exactly how to get each other’s attention. I knew a Snap video of me giving a flirty wink while blowing him a kiss would always get a response, and he knew how to get me to respond when I was irritated with him.

Like the time after three days in a row with no response from me, Patrick sent a Snap video of himself singing the “Bob the Builder” theme song while assembling new furniture. I giggled and shook my head as he belted out the song and flexed his bicep. It was so cute I couldn’t not respond. I hated it when he did adorable things like that.

In the month leading up to my biopsy, Patrick and I had hardly spoken at all. At first, it seemed like one of our normal lulls. But then all my winks, booty pops, and even his favorite nickname got left on read. I suspected something was different when my usual tactics got no response.

Damn, he might be GONE gone this time. He must have started dating someone. That’s fine. Whatever.

I felt sad about the void where his texts and Snaps used to be. As I dealt with the potential of cancer, I longed to reach out to him for comfort.

Claire, do you think he’s the kind of guy who would be there for you in a time like this? He can’t even show up to have sex.

I had to ask myself: Why? Why had I not only tolerated but encouraged a connection with a guy who had shown time and time again he was utterly uninterested in a real relationship with me? The unwanted truth jarred me.

Advertisement

As much as I loved to tease Patrick about being a f-boy, the truth was I was just like him. I refused his attempts to get me to go on real dates with him, like the time he asked me to the airshow or the night he wanted to go to the beach together. I played games, manipulated, and treated him like shit. I took for granted he would always be my safety net when the flighty mixed signals I gave other guys resulted in yet another failed talking stage.

With Patrick as my eager and willing understudy, I didn’t have to worry about keeping a leading man. All my time playing make-believe with Patrick, I was perfecting my toxic defense mechanisms. I was getting better and better at keeping myself out of a relationship and didn’t even realize it.

Sitting on the couch alone after my biopsy, I thought about how I got to this moment. The physical pain of being scraped in the deepest and most feminine part of my body forced me to connect with the emotional pain I used Patrick to avoid that I was lonely.

By keeping a screen between us, I thought I was safe from heartbreak and manipulation — things I’ve struggled with in past relationships. Instead, I was playing “relationship” in a warped reality. I didn’t want to be someone’s online fantasy girl, nor did I want to pine after some Sim dude. At that moment, I began to make conscious decisions to become a woman worth being in an IRL relationship with. The first step was ending things with Patrick.

“Hey. Sorry, I haven’t been around much.” He had never apologized before. His usual playful energy was heavy with guilt, like a dog with his tail between his legs. “I met a girl, and I thought I was in love or something, but I was wrong.” We had never talked about anyone else to each other before.

Advertisement

I wasn’t surprised or angry about the other girl. His vulnerability was unnerving. But it was too late. “I know that feeling, and I’m sorry you’re going through that. I’m not the right person to be comforting you. Especially when I’m hurting over you.”

I didn’t want to play our game anymore. “You need to forget about me. Please.”

Patrick’s idea of ignoring me was creeping on my Instagram stories. Eventually, the emojis returned, and were soon followed by the texts and the Snaps. So, I blocked him. Unlike all the times before, he remains blocked to this day, over a year later.

Now, if I see a guy’s name on my phone screen more than I see him in person, it’s time to move on.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will take the stage at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday to accept his formal nomination for vice president—joining Vice President Kamala Harris on the party’s ticket.

When Is Tim Walz’s Speech?

Walz will speak Wednesday night at the DNC, following speeches by former President Bill Clinton and Oprah Winfrey.

What Is Tim Walz Worth?

Forbes estimates that Walz’s net worth stands at just over $1 million—making him significantly less wealthy than Harris ($8 million), Trump ($4.7 billion) and Vance ($10 million). Walz has spent most of his life in public service, so most of his wealth comes from government pensions from his work in politics and teaching and his wife’s work as a public school teacher. Unlike most Americans, the Walzes don’t appear to own any stocks or bonds, and they don’t own property after selling their home in Mankato, Minnesota, to move into the governor’s residence.

Where Is Tim Walz From?

Walz was born in and grew up in West Point, Nebraska. After graduating high school, he joined the Army National Guard before attending Chadron State College in Chadron, Nebraska, where he graduated with a social science education degree in 1989. He began his career as a teacher in Nebraska, but left the state in 1996 after he was charged with driving under the influence (he later pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of reckless driving). After that, he and his wife moved to Mankato, Minnesota, and he began teaching social studies and geography at Mankato West High School. Walz later earned a master’s degree in educational leadership from Minnesota State University in Mankato in 2001.

Who Is Gwen Walz?

Gwen Walz married Tim Walz in 1994, and the couple has two children, Hope and Gus. Gwen—an English teacher and native of Glencoe, Minnesota—met Tim while they were both teaching in western Nebraska. As Minnesota’s first lady, she has made public education one of her priorities, as well as education in the state’s prisons. She has taken on an unusually large policy role in her husband’s administration and became the first first lady to have an office in the state Capitol, according to the Star Tribune. Gwen and Tim Walz have been open about their struggle to have children and experience with fertility treatments, which eventually helped them conceive their two children, Hope, 23, and Gus, 17, the Star Tribune reported. When speaking about their experience, Tim Walz told reporters, “It’s not by chance that we named our daughter Hope.”

What Was Tim Walz Known For During His Time As Minnesota Governor?

During his second term as governor, Democrats have had control of the legislature, making it possible to pass a slate of progressive legislation. One of his most widely-known moves as governor was signing a law adopting a free school lunch policy. Minnesota also legalized recreational marijuana, passed an increase in tax credits for low-income families, and enacted a law allowing for up to 12 weeks of paid family leave for people caring for a newborn or sick family member or someone recovering from serious illness.

Where Does Tim Walz Stand On Abortion?

In line with his party, Walz is a supporter of abortion rights. Almost immediately after Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, Walz signed an executive order ensuring Minnesota would offer legal protection to people from other states who came to Minnesota for reproductive health services. A year later, he signed the Protect Reproductive Options Act, which secured the right to abortion, contraception, family planning and more in Minnesota. The law made Minnesota the first state to enact new protections following the fall of Roe.

Where Does Tim Walz Stand On Guns?

When he was in Congress representing a rural Minnesota district, Walz—who has long been an avid hunter—earned an “A” rating and support from the National Rifle Association. But Walz’s tune on guns changed after the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida. After that shooting, in which 17 people died, he published an op-ed in the Star Tribune saying the NRA was “the biggest single obstacle to passing the most basic measures to prevent gun violence in America,” and he said he donated the money he received from the NRA to a charity helping families of troops who are hurt while serving. He said his daughter Hope helped him change his views on guns after she asked him to do all he could to fight gun violence after Parkland. As governor, he passed a number of gun control laws, including universal background checks and red flag laws.

How Did Tim Walz Respond To The 2020 George Floyd Protests And Riots?

After George Floyd was murdered by a police officer in Minneapolis, protests, riots and arson broke out in the Twin Cities. Minneapolis’ mayor asked Walz to send in the National Guard, but the governor was slow to respond and didn’t send them in until the next day, leading to criticism from Republicans who said the delay made it harder for law enforcement to control the situation, The New York Times reported. Later in the year, Walz instituted a slate of police reforms that banned chokeholds, provided mental health services for police and mandated certain training. Trump and Vance began attacking Walz over his handling of the riots shortly after he was named as Harris’ running mate. But audio obtained by ABC News recently showed Trump praised Walz’s handling of the riots in the immediate aftermath, saying he was “very happy” with it.

What Do Tim Walz’s Polls Say?

Walz had a net favorability rating of +4.5 as of Wednesday, according to FiveThirtyEight’s average, with an average of 38.1% finding him favorable and 33.5% finding him unfavorable. Walz’s favorability is higher than that of his competition, JD Vance, so far, though Walz is still less well-known than Vance. Vance’s net favorability, according to FiveThirtyEight, was -10, with 43.2% of people finding him unfavorable and 33.2% finding him favorable.

Why Has Tim Walz Been Attacked For His National Guard Service?

Shortly after Walz was announced as Harris’ pick, Vance raised a years-old allegation, with no evidence, that Walz left the National Guard to avoid being deployed to Iraq. Walz and some of his fellow guardsmen have long disputed the issue, with Walz arguing instead he retired after 24 years to run for Congress. Vance accused Walz of “stolen valor,” and Trump said he was “a disgrace to our country” over the issue, which has circulated in Minnesota politics for years. The Minnesota National Guard was reportedly not informed of its deployment until two months after Walz announced his Congressional run, but there were rumors when he announced the run that the battalion could be deployed, a retired command sergeant major who served with Walz told ABC News.

Why Is He Called ‘coach Walz?’

At their first rally together after Harris announced Walz as her running mate, she referred to him—among other things—as “Coach Walz,” referencing the years he served as a high school football coach. When he returned from teaching abroad in China, Walz taught at Alliance High School in Alliance, Nebraska, where he also worked as a coach for the girls basketball team and as the defensive coordinator for the football team. Walz was later the football team’s defensive coordinator and linebackers coach at a Minnesota high school, and during that time, the team went from losing 27 straight games to winning a state championship before he stopped coaching in 2002. A number of Walz’s former players have spoken out since he was announced as Harris’ running mate, with more than 10 players telling The Washington Post he was a high-energy coach who liked a practical joke and helped transform the program. Walz was also the first faculty advisor to his Minnesota high school’s gay-straight alliance in 1999, telling the Minnesota Star-Tribune it “needed to be the football coach, who was the soldier and was straight and was married.”

f2dad30934,Financial Times,"Museum Reinhard Ernst — Fumihiko Maki’s elegant, elusive farewell - Financial Times","The architect Fumihiko Maki died in June at the age of 95, just before the opening of his Reinhard Ernst Museum. It might seem curious that this Pritzker Prize-winning architect, who built the much-lauded MIT Media Lab, a New York skyscraper and was also building for the UN in Manhattan, should have his legacy defined by a building in the modest German city of Wiesbaden.

But it is also, perhaps, appropriate. For all that Maki built a career at the very centre of modern architecture, from his role in founding the Japanese movement of Metabolism in the 1960s to his exquisitely minimal Tower Four at the World Trade Center — by some distance the best new commercial building on Ground Zero — he was a modest, quiet man. He never sought to develop an immediately recognisable style or build a cult of personality. As a result, he slipped through the net, widely admired in the profession but not much known beyond it.

An elegant, pure structure that’s also somewhat slippery and difficult to pin down, the new €85mn museum, built to house one of Germany’s most illustrious personal collections, might make a perfect epitaph.

The Reinhard Ernst collection is unusual in that it concentrates entirely on postwar abstract art, mainly American, European and Japanese. Ernst — a businessman who sold his precision engineering company to focus on collecting — had worked with Maki before, having commissioned him to design a community centre in Natori, Japan. So when he came to build a new museum in his adopted hometown, he approached the architect (by now a friend) again.

The result is a striking white stone building that resembles a sculpture made from giant sugar cubes. It looks about as abstract as an architecture could be. There is no hint of the reality of construction; even the joints in the stone cladding have had stone dust rubbed into them so they seem to disappear.

As you approach, it resembles one of those enigmatic, white-walled houses you occasionally stumble upon in a Tokyo street. It seems totally autonomous, unconcerned with its architectural context — part of which is the old Wiesbaden Museum next door, a stolid block with a classical portico. But that’s deceptive, says Ernst, pointing me towards a building opposite as we walk through the space: “Look how Maki took those proportions and mirrored them here. They line up.”

Inside, you find yourself in a world of white. The spaces are flooded with natural light — from above, from the sides, from courtyards, atria and skylights. Your eye is drawn towards a few striking works, including Tony Cragg’s seven-metre-high sculpture “Pair”, two tottering stacks of gold, and Bettina Pousttchi’s pillar-box-red “Vertical Highways — Progressions 4”, constructed from crushed, reshaped motorway crash barriers.

At the centre of the building, a courtyard — vaguely Japanese in style and adorned with a single, delicate-looking maple tree — accommodates a chunky piece by Eduardo Chillida, a group of folded Corten steel plates and looking a little like a family of weird chairs. The piece was so heavy that the floor had to be reinforced, Ernst tells me, with apparent pride.

If there’s a lot of circulation space — a profligacy that might not have happened in a publicly funded museum — for Ernst this is very much part of the appeal. Remarkably, the building is open only to school groups until midday each day; kids seem to relish the endless lobbies, big sculptures and the spaces in between.

While less imposing, the galleries themselves are generous, if somehow a little frictionless. The resistance is provided by the art, which is colourful and mostly wonderful. One of the world’s largest collections of Helen Frankenthaler is given only a little exposure, but even what’s on show is great. There is also Robert Motherwell, Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland, Lee Krasner, Hans Hartung, Pierre Soulages, much more. You find an entire gallery devoted to Frank Stella’s remarkable “Moby Dick” works, frantic, swirling wall sculptures that attempt to capture the roiling sea and the mad obsession of the chase.

Reflecting Ernst’s links with Japan, also present are numerous canvases by artists including Shōzō Shimamoto, Tōkō Shinoda, Kazuo Shiraga, Atsuko Tanaka and Inoue Yūichi — epic, striking pieces all.

Pollock and Richter might be slimly represented, and Rothko and Still absent altogether (“too expensive”, says Ernst, and fair enough), but arguably that makes the museum interesting. It doesn’t attempt a narrative of abstraction but certain ideas do emerge: the relationship between the body and physicality, engagement with materials, the line, calligraphy and so on. There is no attempt at the encyclopedic; this is unapologetically the collection of one man — and a man who clearly loves colour.

Perhaps the only thing that is missing in this elegant new building is a clear sense of the architect himself. For the museum’s opening, a show on Maki’s work has been mounted, showcasing key projects such as 4 World Trade Center, Toronto’s Aga Khan Museum (2014), the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in California (1993) and the National Museum of Modern Art Kyoto (1986). Yet it misses more interesting, idiosyncratic projects such as his early Kaze-no-Oka crematorium, an enigmatic landscape of memory and containment that makes death seem altogether uplifting and mysterious.

That some of Maki’s best buildings were corporate — glassy, slick, shiny, effective — probably didn’t help his profile. Yet somehow his works never quite amounted to an oeuvre; even if they might be individually excellent, each appears as an effort to address a particular place, site or client.

It’s an unexpected thing, to be missing from your own monograph. Yet perhaps that’s precisely what architects should sometimes aim to do, especially in a museum — to work well, then to disappear and allow the contents to shine.

Project 2025 Leader Unveils Plan for Life After Second American Revolution

More than a hundred conservative organizations contributed to the proposals put forward by Project 2025.

Project 2025, an initiative spearheaded by the conservative Heritage Foundation, has published a 900-page handbook proposing a massive overhaul of the federal government should former president Donald Trump win back the White House in November, including firing thousands of government workers so that Republican loyalists can be installed in their place.

President Joe Biden's campaign has called the document ""an extreme policy and personnel playbook for Trump's second term that should scare the hell out of the American people."" Many of the proposed policies are not popular with voters.

Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has sought to distance himself from Project 2025.

""I know nothing about Project 2025,"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Friday. ""I have no idea who is behind it. I disagree with some of the things they're saying and some of the things they're saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal. Anything they do, I wish them luck, but I have nothing to do with them.""

However, more than two dozen people who served in Trump's administration helped craft Project 2025's policy document.

Project 2025 has said it does not speak for any candidate or campaign.

""We are a coalition of more than 110 conservative groups advocating policy and personnel recommendations for the next conservative president,"" a Project 2025 spokesperson previously said in a statement to Newsweek.

""But it is ultimately up to that president, who we believe will be President Trump, to decide which recommendations to implement.""

Project 2025's website says a coalition of over 100 conservative organizations helped ""form the project pillars."" It adds that the ""opinions of Project 2025 and The Heritage Foundation do not necessarily represent the opinions of every one of its advisory board partners.""

0a0122cb40,USA TODAY,"Texas woman gets 15 years for stealing nearly $109M from Army to buy mansions, cars - USA TODAY","AUSTIN, Texas — A Texas woman who stole nearly $109 million from a grant program intended to provide services for military children and families to fund her lavish lifestyle was sentenced Tuesday to federal prison, the U.S. Attorney's Office said.

Janet Yamanaka Mello, 57, was sentenced to 15 years in federal court in San Antonio, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Texas said in a news release. According to a criminal court docket, Mello pleaded guilty in March to five counts of mail fraud and five counts of filing a false tax return for a scheme that went undetected by the U.S. Army for six years.

Mello was a civilian employee for the Army and worked as a child, youth, and school services financial program manager for the Army Morale, Welfare, and Recreation program at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, court documents showed. As part of her job, Mello determined whether funds were available for various entities that applied to the 4-H Military Partnership Grant program.

She formed a business called Child Health and Youth Lifelong Development, which Mello used to illicitly obtain grant funds from the military grant program, according to court documents. Prosecutors said Mello used the fraudulent business to apply for over 40 grants through the program from around December 2016 through at least August 2023.

Mello then spent the funds received by Child Health and Youth Lifelong Development on various personal items, including high-end jewelry, clothing, luxury vehicles, and real estate, court documents said.

""Janet Mello betrayed the trust of the government agency she served and repeatedly lied in an effort to enrich herself,"" said U.S. Attorney Jaime Esparza in a statement. ""Rather than $109 million in federal funds going to the care of military children throughout the world, she selfishly stole that money to buy extravagant houses, more than 80 vehicles, and over 1,500 pieces of jewelry.""

Former Army civilian employee received nearly $109M in payments

As part of the scheme, Mello drafted fraudulent memoranda that indicated Child Health and Youth Lifelong Development was approved to receive grant funds from the military program, according to court documents. She then submitted the paperwork to her supervisor for approval.

""Mello played on the trust she had developed over the years with her supervisors and co-workers to secure the necessary approvals,"" court documents said. ""After receiving the necessary approvals, the paperwork was then passed on to (Defense Finance and Accounting Service) for payment.""

The Defense Finance and Accounting Service, which oversees payments to Department of Defense service members, employees, vendors, and contractors, sent checks in the amount requested to a UPS Store mailbox in the San Antonio area, according to court documents. Once a check was received, Mello would deposit it into her bank account.

Court documents showed that Mello repeated the process 49 times during a six-year period, requesting about $117,000,000 in payments, and receiving about $108,917,749.

Court documents detailed numerous transactions Mello made using the funds, including spending more than $788,000 in jewelry in October and November 2022; purchasing over $264,000 for a 2023 Range Rover; and buying property in Canyon Lake, Texas, for more than $3.3 million.

Janet Mello omitted millions of dollars, failed to accurately report income

Mello also failed to accurately report her income for tax years 2017, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, omitting the millions of dollars of income she received through her fraudulent business, according to court documents

""Her actions reflect exactly the opposite of what it means to serve your country, and my office will continue to work tirelessly to prosecute those who illegally seek personal gain at the expense of their fellow citizens,"" Esparza said.

Maria Thomas, special agent in charge for the Department of the Army Criminal Investigation Division's Central Texas Field Office, argued that corruption and fraud schemes in the Army jeopardize the safety and security of soldiers and their families. She said the Army community is committed to aggressively pursuing anyone who uses government programs for personal gain.

""Mello's penchant for extravagance is what brought her down. We identified that her reported income was well below the lavish lifestyle she lived. As we uncovered the details, the criminal scheme grew, the dollar amount grew, and the reach of her spending grew,"" said Lucy Tan, acting special agent in charge for the IRS Criminal Investigation's Houston Field Office, in a statement.

1952afd361,CBC.ca,"Province posts draft rules for podiatry, moves to make it a regulated health profession - CBC.ca","The government of Prince Edward Island has published draft regulations that would make podiatry a regulated health profession in the province.

The draft regulations, posted on the province's website Thursday, lay out rules for those who want to diagnose and treat foot conditions as podiatrists.

They include completing a post-secondary program in podiatry, being covered by liability insurance, and having up-to-date training in first aid and CPR.

The draft regulations make the P.E.I. College of Physicians and Surgeons responsible for determining who can practise as a podiatrist on the Island.

READ: The draft regulations as posted on the P.E.I. government site

As regulations rather than legislation, the changes don't require a vote in the legislature but can be approved by Premier Dennis King's cabinet. If that happens, P.E.I. will become the ninth province in Canada to regulate this branch of medicine.

Podiatrists will need authorization to perform some kinds of treatment under the new rules, and that go-ahead will depend on whether they can prove they have completed the relevant training.

Those treatments include injecting a drug into the foot, prescribing a drug, administering a drug or substance by inhalation, and applying electrical energy in the form of laser therapy to treat a fungal foot infection.

This move by the province comes less than a month after a CBC News investigation outlined concerns being raised about Island podiatrist John Johnson in the wake of a Chief Public Health Office alert about past sterilization practices at his clinic.

The clinic has a sign on its door for ""Dr. John Johnson, DP"" and Johnson treats people for various foot conditions.

However, multiple people, including Johnson's former stepmother Melanie Johnson, told CBC he appears to have no formal education or credentials in podiatry.

CBC News has asked John Johnson for proof of his credentials, but he hasn't provided them or responded to the allegations.

In late June, P.E.I.'s Chief Public Health Office told patients of Johnson Podiatry that they should arrange to be tested for HIV and hepatitis, over concerns about past infection control measures there.

""I want to emphasize that no one is ill or has reported illness,"" Dr. Heather Morrison, P.E.I.'s chief public health officer, said at the time.

Her office said the issues have been resolved and the risk to the public is very low.

Reacting to the CPHO warning, Johnson told CBC News that staff at his clinic have always operated to the highest standards in terms of sterilization and hygiene.

""I'm very confident there is going to be no risk to the public and everything we have been doing has been safe for all Islanders,"" he said.",A person in blue gloves is performing a foot examination on another person's foot.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BCAD599F0>,2024-08-09 19:48:00+00:00,https://www.cbc.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-draft-regulations-podiatry-1.7290434,['Health' 'Local/Regional'],[0.95 0.85],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/1952afd361.png
a4e7b10264,Financial Times,Rolls-Royce to gift every employee more than £700 worth of shares - Financial Times,"Rolls-Royce is to give more than £700 worth of shares to each of its employees after a bounceback in its business saw it raise profit guidance and resume dividend payments for the first time in five years.

Chief executive Tufan Erginbilgiç told employees in an internal message on Thursday that the FTSE 100 group would gift 150 shares to “every colleague, in every part of our organisation” in September.

Shares in Rolls-Royce have more than quintupled since Erginbilgic took the helm in January 2023, buoyed by a rebound in international travel and a restructuring plan implemented by the former oil industry executive. They closed at 491p in London on Thursday, valuing the share awards at about £730.

In his message, part of which has been seen by the Financial Times, Erginbilgic said the resumption of the dividend payout marked an “important moment” for Rolls-Royce shareholders and future investors. Many, he added, “view a dividend as a prerequisite to invest” in the company.

In his message, Erginbilgic said the results had been made possible by the company’s employees, adding that it was “important that you share in our success”. “We want to recognise your contribution to our future success and reward you for the role you will play in it,” he added.

The group, whose engines power large passenger aircraft, suspended its payout in 2020 — the first time it had done so since privatisation in 1987 — as it was reeling from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Rolls-Royce makes most of its money from maintaining and servicing its engines when they are flying but Covid grounded most of the world’s large aircraft.

Since he became chief executive, Erginbilgic moved swiftly to instigate a sweeping cost efficiency and turnaround plan, including centralising core functions such as human resources. He has also focused on renegotiating lossmaking engine contracts.

The company on Thursday reported £1.1bn of operating profit in the first half of the year, up 74 per cent compared with last year. It also increased its forecast for underlying operating profit this year to between £2.1bn and £2.3bn. It is targeting free cash flow of between £2.1bn and £2.2bn, higher than its previous guidance of £1.7bn to £1.9bn.

Rolls-Royce already has a share-purchase scheme for employees but it is the first time it has gifted stock outright. Employees will have to hold on to the shares for a certain period of time, according to people familiar with the plans, who confirmed that the CEO would not receive any shares.

Rolls-Royce may issue new shares or use stock held in its own treasury as the company is understood to have flexibility in how it designs its share plans as granted by shareholders at its annual meeting. The company last year employed just over 40,000 people globally, according to its latest annual report so the share awards will cost the group an estimated £30mn.

Rolls-Royce said it is “important that all our people are able to share in our success, that is why we are giving them the opportunity to own part of Rolls-Royce by gifting 150 shares to every colleague”.","An industrial setting with two individuals working on machinery, one with a tattoo on the arm, and a monitor displaying information.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA2F6E830>,2024-08-02 08:00:19.120000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/a6af8de7-4381-485e-8e6d-a3ae2fee34c0,['Business and Finance'],[0.95],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/a4e7b10264.png
1ddac1e955,Newsweek,"Inside Caffeine Addicts Anonymous: Ruined marriages, tempers, tattoos - Newsweek","Fifty years after he started sneaking swigs of his parents' leftover coffee and guzzling cups of Lipton iced tea, Ed Csapo is finally giving up his caffeinated ghost.

For decades, Csapo, a former carpenter who owns a heavy machinery supplier in Longmont, Colorado, enjoyed a hot java at home before driving to work and grabbing another serving on the way, usually from Starbucks.

""I like driving with a hot cup of coffee,"" Csapo, 61, told Newsweek. ""There's nothing like it.""

During extended road trips, Csapo's affinity for caffeine extended to occasional energy drinks like Red Bull, but coffee remained his constant companion for years, leading him to become a self-professed ""snob"" of the world's most widely used psychoactive stimulant.

""I bought organic Blue Jamaican, I paid big money,"" he recalled. ""I had all the accouterment, the best filters, you know, the best glassware.""

But Csapo, who guzzled up to three cups per day in addition to soda or other caffeinated drinks, soon realized his obsession grew unhealthy—and likely his attempt to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

""I was trying to medicate myself,"" Csapo said. ""And I had a lot of feelings coming up. It controlled me enough.""

Determined to put coffee in his rearview mirror forever, Csapo joined Caffeine Addicts Anonymous (CAFAA) five years ago. No longer would he be so short-tempered with his wife or anxiously force conversations at work or elsewhere, Csapo resolved.

Joining the online support group that mirrors the 12-step program utilized by Alcoholics Anonymous quickly led to dividends for Csapo, who enjoyed 19 caffeine-free months before a lapse following shoulder surgery. He's since gone 10 months without the stimulant—and has no intentions of picking up a caffeinated cup again.

""I made more money than I ever have before,"" Csapo said of abstaining from caffeine. ""My relationship with my wife got better, my relationships with all my clients got better and my relationships with my family got better.""

Csapo's caffeine-free lifestyle, combined with a plant-based diet and meditation, has become his very own ""superpower,"" he said, buttressed by a desire to stave off anxiety, headaches or insomnia.

""One hundred percent abstinence from it has really freed me up to access the mystery and awe of life,"" he said. ""If you want to stop and smell the roses, you're going to want to be present for that.""

Csapo credits CAFAA, which has roughly 2,000 members in the United States, England, Australia, France and Germany, for giving him the support he desperately needed.

""I knew that something was off here,"" he said. ""And the thing is, I can't have this conversation with anybody except at a CAFAA meeting, where people can identify with me. That's why CAFAA is so cool—because nobody wants to hear it out here in the world.""

Csapo tries to raise awareness of CAFAA at every opportunity, including at his local Starbucks, where he posted a flyer with the group's website on Wednesday.

""Do you have issues with consuming too much caffeine?"" the message read. ""There is help!""

Csapo also believes all products containing caffeine, especially those with high concentrations, should be labeled as a significant public health threat.

""I want all caffeine products to have a label on it: can cause death,"" Csapo said. ""It has to be on there.""

Up to 400 milligrams of caffeine per day—roughly 4 or 5 cups of coffee—is typically not associated with negative health effects, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). But how people process the drug varies widely and rapid consumption of about 1,200 milligrams could lead to seizures or adverse reactions.

FDA officials say highly caffeinated products have contributed to at least two deaths in the United States, where four lawsuits have been filed in connection to Panera Bread's now-discontinued Charged Lemonade.

Sarah Katz, a 21-year-old college student with an underlying heart condition, died from cardiac arrest in September 2022 after drinking a Charged Lemonade that contained up to 390 milligrams of caffeine per 30 ounces at a Panera Bread in Philadelphia that wasn't labeled as an energy drink, her family's lawsuit alleges.

Energy drinks can contain more than twice the amount of caffeine compared to coffee, prompting the American Academy of Pediatrics to call for ""heightened awareness of the risks of caffeine use, abuse and even toxicity"" among children and adolescents.

Dennis Brown, 46, of Fleming Island, Florida, died in October 2023 after drinking three Charged Lemonades. Brown had a chromosomal deficiency disorder and his relatives filed suit against Panera, alleging the bakery-cafe chain's ""defective and unreasonably dangerous design"" led to cardiac arrest. Two other consumers are also suing the company, alleging that they suffered permanent cardiac injuries after drinking Panera's discontinued drink.

Another CAFAA member, meanwhile, said he joined the support group two years ago to address his worsening addiction that mushroomed well beyond 1,200 milligrams per day.

""I have the inability to consume responsible amounts of caffeine,"" the 43-year-old Los Angeles man told Newsweek. ""It always starts off with the best of intentions, but green tea snowballs to regular tea, which snowballs to coffee, which snowballs to espresso, which snowballs to energy drinks. I can't stop myself.""

The Army veteran who asked to be solely identified as Geoff was diagnosed with bipolar disorder before being discharged in 2003. His extreme caffeine intake heavily factored into the ongoing dissolution of his 19-year marriage, among other detrimental outcomes, he said.

""It's pretty extreme stuff—caffeine addiction at its worst,"" Geoff said. ""I guess I'm just grateful it wasn't some other worse drug that I got into.""

At one point, Geoff kept caffeine at bay for nine months, but later relapsed and checked himself into a psychiatric ward for several days. He's now nearing three months without the stimulant, thanks in large part to CAFAA's fellowship.

""It's a really safe space,"" said Geoff, who plans to keep attending as many as three meetings weekly. ""That's where the real transformation is going to occur, to the point where I can be around people drinking energy drinks and coffee and it doesn't really call to me.""

A self-professed ""coffee junkie"" and fellow CAFAA member echoed Geoff's take, saying the support groups that range in size from a handful of participants to several dozen have motivated her to never again consume as many as 11 cups of coffee per day.

""In CAFAA, they use the phrase being wired and tired,"" she said of caffeine's impact. ""So being both revved and hyped up, but also being exhausted ... It also made me feel calm and comfortable, like oh good, I've got some relief here.""

Becoming ""caffeine sober"" has created a more serene existence for the 64-year-old New York native now living in North Carolina, she said.

""I'm much, much calmer,"" said the woman who asked to be identified as Norma. ""I was kind of like a whirling dervish.""

Norma, who is nearing 20 months without caffeine, is also experiencing increased focus and patience, she said.

Norma decided to immortalize her love for coffee two years ago with a tattoo of a cup on her right arm, one of several dozen she's gotten in the past several years. Weeks later, she decided to eradicate caffeine from her diet. The ink now serves as a constant reminder of her journey.

""I am never getting the tattoo removed or covered over, which people do for various reasons,"" she said. ""It was a very important part of who I am, but also, talk about not being able to deny that you're a coffee addict. I mean, that's a pretty serious thing.""","A collage of images including a woman drinking from a cup, a person holding a cup, a coffee machine, a bottle with 'CY' written on it, a laptop with a video call, and coffee beans.",<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BA25B5B10>,2024-08-14 20:36:18+00:00,https://www.newsweek.com,https://www.newsweek.com/caffeine-addicts-support-group-1939382,['Health'],[0.9],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/1ddac1e955.png
1ebf351cb7,The Guardian,"Films, fashion, law, politics: George and Amal Clooney’s growing global reach - The Guardian","It took a famous TV doctor to diagnose the patient. After two weeks of turmoil in the US Democratic party over President Biden’s re-election bid, it was ER’s Doug Ross, AKA George Clooney, who wrote up a devastating evaluation of the incumbent president.

The 63-year-old actor was not in theatrical mode when he wrote a more-in-sorrow letter published by the New York Times last week that called on Biden to withdraw from the presidential race that the White House reportedly begged him not to submit, coming three weeks after Clooney helped raise $30m for the Biden-Harris ticket at a lavish Hollywood fundraiser.

But Clooney’s bedside manner was impeccable: “I love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice-president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him,” he wrote. “But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can.”

Clooney was speaking for ­himself – and for a large swathe of liberal-leaning Hollywood donors angry at what they see as White House deception over the apparent decline of Biden’s health. Clooney said the man at the fundraiser “was the same man we all witnessed” in his debate performance two weeks later.

In the current spirit of panic and recrimination, with a White House press corps turning every Biden appearance into a test of competence, Democrat money bundlers, including co-chair of Biden’s re-election campaign and movie producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, are under suspicion of helping to cover up Biden’s apparent health issues.

Clooney’s letter has put the Ocean’s Eleven actor out of political harm’s way. The Democratic party may not be so lucky. Democrats, says James Carville, the Clinton strategist who last week called for a blitz primary to select a new candidate, “are hellbent on a mission to force the American people to do something they don’t want to do – to vote for Joe Biden”.

“George has come out, [former house speaker] Nancy Pelosi has come out – I don’t know what else people can do,” Carville told the Observer. “Other than a few people in Congress, everybody thinks this is a terrible idea [for Biden to run]. But you’re up against a guy who doesn’t want to leave, and that’s just where we are.”

George Clooney is not the only Clooney making waves on a global stage. Last month his wife Amal Clooney was revealed to have played an important role in making the case for arrest warrants to be issued by the international criminal court (ICC) to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, defence minister Yoav Gallant and three top Hamas leaders.

Biden called the ICC move “outrageous” and said that whatever the ICC prosecutor might imply, “there is no equivalence – none – between Israel and Hamas”. According to the Washington Post, George Clooney called Steve Ricchetti, counsellor to the US president, to protest about the administration’s willingness to impose sanctions in which his wife could get caught.

This week, the Biden-Harris campaign attempted to blame Clooney’s letter on “pre-existing tensions” – hinting at the ICC dust-up. A Hollywood producer familiar with the couple told the Observer that the White House’s explanation for the letter was “bullshit” and the lawyer had been smeared because her work is on human rights irrespective of political division.

“George has power in Hollywood. Amal doesn’t, except as George’s wife,” they added. “Her power is in the UK, at the Hague and on the pages of Vogue.”

The lawyer has not commented on her husband’s political intervention, which may have come with Barack Obama’s tacit approval. But after 10 years together, George and Amal Clooney are seen as one of the most stable couples in Hollywood.

They’d met at the actor’s home in Lake Como, Italy, when a mutual friend brought her by. Clooney’s agent had also got wind of the ­introduction, the actor later revealed. “My agent said: ‘I met this woman who is coming to your house, who you’re going to marry.’ It really worked out that way.”

“It felt like the most natural thing in the world,” Amal said. “I always hoped there could be love that was overwhelming and didn’t require any weighing or decision-making.”

A safari in Kenya to see giraffes sealed the deal. In 2014 he proposed, they married in Venice and now have twins.

The political instinct which had surfaced in Clooney films including Good Night, and Good Luck (2005) and The Ides of March (2011), soon took flight. By 2016 the couple were meeting with then-German chancellor Angela Merkel to talk refugee policy; that year they were at a UN refugee summit and soon after established the Clooney Foundation for Justice, which focuses on legal rights for those targeted by oppressive governments, tracking the money of human rights abusers and those profiting from war crimes.

“We’re both inspired by the young people out there challenging injustice in their communities, a new generation that won’t accept the status quo,” the actor said in an awards acceptance speech two years ago.

But Clooney’s intervention comes with potential costs. The Bidens, like the Clintons and Obamas, may see themselves as benefiting from rubbing shoulders with celebrities, but the intersection of entertainment and politics, and the money and ideologies that underpin it, is repulsive to many outside political-entertainment enclaves. In an echo of Trump, Biden now says the rising chorus against him is coming from members of “the elites”, despite the bad timing of first lady Dr Jill Biden appearing on the cover of the August US Vogue.

The tradition of celebrity-political endorsements goes back to Frank Sinatra, who organised his friends, the Rat Pack, to campaign for John F Kennedy. Two decades later, disagreements over Ronald Reagan forced celebrities to choose where they belonged.

“That’s where we are still,” explains veteran Democrat strategist Hank Sheinkopf. “Celebrities see themselves as an important part of the Democratic fundraising and thought-based operation, which a lot of Americans would not agree with.”

Sheinkopf says that the fight over Biden’s future is as much about the future of the Democratic party as it is about Biden’s health – and Clooney’s intervention will make Maga Republicans fight harder for candidate Trump.

“Democrats are the party of the elites despite the fact that they see themselves as the party of the non-elites,” he says. Regardless of who is writing the cheques – Hollywood celebrities or a rightwing Texas industrialist – “what all elites want is a party that does what they want because they think it’s right”.

“But that’s not who Joe Biden is. He represents the old pro-union, almost colour-blind left, but that’s not who the operators behind the scenes are,” he adds.

Peter Bart, previous editor of the Hollywood trade bible Variety, wrote in a Deadline column that he had “great respect for Clooney’s decision” but it was also one that “will cost him”.

He recalled other Hollywood stars who had mixed politics with entertainment, including Jane Fonda, Charlton Heston and John Wayne. “Apart from potential career damage, Clooney must confront donors who have spent millions at his ­urging to support a ticket he now renounces,” Bart, 91, warned.

He recalled a conversation he’d had with Ronald Reagan about Nixon. “I want people to like me, even voters who vote against me,” Reagan told him. “Nixon doesn’t seem to care, but I’m still an actor.”

Still, Clooney’s intervention has set him up for criticism. The progressive left and African-American voters, both voting blocs Biden is courting to firm up his support, slammed the actor for taking a position afforded him by being famous, white and male.

Others have implied that perspectives are different from the window seat of a Gulfstream jet flying between homes in Los Angeles, England, France and Italy. (Besides being a successful actor, known for pranking friends, Clooney and partner Rande Gerber, husband of Cindy Crawford, split up to $1bn from the sale of their tequila brand Casamigos.)

Clooney has been criticised, too, from the other side. Trump weighed in, saying Clooney “turned on Crooked Joe like the rats they both are”, and some have questioned why Clooney, and Hollywood more broadly, waited until after the debate to disclose what they had witnessed at the fundraiser.

Still, the New York Times letter establishes the Kentucky-born actor as a modern-day Warren Beatty, the actor who made his political beliefs part of his public image. Beatty never ran for office and quipped it would be “more like running for crucifixion”, nor has Clooney, allowing both to ride over the humdrum day-to-day of retail politics.

“George’s op-ed was provocative, well done, but voters don’t want this anyway: 73% of the voting public say they want something different,” says Carville. “They’re not asking for anything difficult – just a different nominee. We’re in a crisis.”","An image of two individuals, presumably George Clooney and Amal Clooney, with their faces blurred, standing in front of a backdrop with the text 'The Observer'.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BA364C790>,2024-07-13 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/jul/13/george-and-amal-clooney-global-reach-biden-netanyahu,['Politics'],[0.95],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/1ebf351cb7.png
9444924d40,The Guardian,"Labour and Conservative battlebuses hit the road, but ‘lonely figure’ Sunak seems like a solo traveller - The Guardian","We may be in an era when elections are fought with TikTok memes and Instagram reels, but one thing has stubbornly refused to give way in the digital age: the good old battle of the campaign buses. On Saturday, Rishi Sunak unveiled the Conservatives’ bus that will tour the country during the 2024 election, emblazoned with the slogan: “Clear plan. Bold action. Secure future.”

It is – arguably – a slightly snappier version of John Major’s bus in 1997, which bore the words: “You can only be sure with the Conservatives.”

It may seem surprising, but a lot of thought goes into these slogans, which are “road-tested” in focus groups and argued over endlessly by election strategists. In 2017, the Tories got theirs disastrously wrong – the slogan was: “Theresa May: For Britain.” But during the campaign, the country then suddenly turned against May. The personalisation of the campaign around her backfired and almost certainly contributed to the Tories losing their majority.

After much head-scratching in recent days, Labour got its slogan choice for this election down to a short and unrisky one word of six letters. In Uxbridge, west London, on Saturday, Keir Starmer revealed his bus with “Change” written, large and small, 15 times on its sides.

There was also another difference between the two parties at Saturday’s launches – one that has been increasingly evident at campaign and media events over recent days. Starmer was accompanied by two big names in his shadow cabinet: the party’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, and its chancellor, Rachel Reeves. Everyone noticed that “Ange” was part of Change. In some photos, Rayner was striding ahead of Starmer.

But with no members of Sunak’s cabinet either alongside the prime minister or battling on his behalf across national media, no such collective loyalty and togetherness in the heat of battle was on display. Where were they?

With no disrespect to Ben Houchen, the Conservative mayor of Tees Valley, who was with the prime minister in the north-east on Saturday, and the local MPs and candidates who have been by his side at events, they are not household names or really big-hitters at national level who catch the eye on TV.

Labour is noticing and pointing to the absence of the likes of Penny Mordaunt, Kemi Badenoch, Grant Shapps – all three are seen as potential leadership candidates if the Tories lose and Sunak goes – from the prime minister’s side or the national airwaves.

The foreign secretary, David Cameron, has been on holiday in Italy, while Michael Gove has gone into the background, having announced he is stepping down.

“Rishi does cut a very lonely figure,” said a senior Labour frontbencher on Saturday. “Whether they have not been asked or they have chosen not to [be with the prime minister], it is very striking. We have heard from Jeremy Hunt and Mel Stride, but that is just about it as far as I can recall.”

Sir Charles Walker, the retiring Tory MP for Broxbourne, said he thought Sunak was fighting a “really energetic campaign – better than I expected, actually”. He added: “Maybe this is just the campaign they want to fight: maybe they want it to be the young Rishi with lots of fight in him against the later-middle-aged man. I don’t know, but that might be what they actually want to do.”

According to Labour, which is trying to track what it calls a cabinet “missing in action”, Badenoch has hardly been pictured out campaigning or in the media since the start of the election campaign.

The only cabinet members Sunak has joined up with have been David TC Davies in Wales, Chris Heaton-Harris in Northern Ireland and Mel Stride in Devon. “It’s not the lineup of big names he would have wanted to kick off the campaign,” said a Labour figure.

The Tory party has managed to fill the airwaves with middle-ranking or junior ministers and staunch Sunak allies. Last Monday, Foreign Office minister of state Anne-Marie Trevelyan was sent out on the broadcast round, while Tuesday was the turn of work and pensions secretary – and Sunak supporter – Stride, before minister of state for schools Damian Hinds was asked to appear on radio on Wednesday morning and Question Time on Thursday evening.

Hunt was the only front-rank “big beast” to go out to bat for Sunak, appearing on the Today programme and BBC Breakfast on Thursday. To round off the week, Stride made a second appearance on the Today programme.

If ever there was a week in which the Tories needed to come together and start closing the gap with Labour, it was the last one. Their disastrous launch – Sunak in a soaking suit outside No 10 when he kicked the campaign off in pouring rain was the image that has stuck – got them off to the worst possible start. Since then, the Conservatives have had their chances.

In recent days, Labour, more than the Tories, looked to be in difficulties. The chaotic handling of whether Diane Abbott should be allowed to stand again as a Labour MP left Starmer under real pressure, looking, as one senior figure in his party put it, “indecisive and vindictive all at the same time”.

Senior Labour figures were furious until Starmer eventually decided Abbott could stand after all. “It has been appalling,” said one former cabinet minister. “We are supposed to be all about discipline and yet we allow this to happen.”

Even grandees in the party were left in the dark as to what was going on, and they were seething. “Not good,” said one senior figure. “In fact, bloody terrible.”

At the same time, with Labour somewhat light on new policy offers, the Tories suddenly seemed brimful of them. A new form of national service might not have proved universally popular but it gave the impression that the Tory campaign was at least alive.

Then came more help for pensioners through an enhanced triple lock and plans to get rid of what the party calls “bogus degrees”.

During a campaign event at Niftylift – manufacturer of mobile access platforms – near Milton Keynes on Thursday, Sunak and the Conservatives avoided the blunders of the previous week and pulled off a quick, quite slick event.

Sunak said the big question for voters and the workers at the company who were listening in was: “Who do you trust” to take the country forward.

“Labour will increase your taxes by £2,000 per household,” he said, before claiming Starmer “is going to release all the illegal immigrants”. It was a dangerous world in which only the Tories would offer security.

Two of those who were there, Ian Emmington, an e-learning developer, and Mark Whiley, a technical author, were undecided before hearing Sunak – and no clearer after.

“He is smooth, yes,” said Emmington after listening to the prime minister’s Q&A. “But it is all just rhetoric. We have heard it all before and things never change. Who are you supposed to believe?”

But this weekend, after a tough few days for Labour, the polls still appear to be going in the wrong direction for the Conservatives. Sunak needs some serious “buy-in” to the campaign from senior figures in his party if he is to make progress, which at the moment appears to be lacking.

On Tuesday, the prime minister and Starmer will clash in the first television debate of the campaign on ITV.

Sunak really needs a clear win, otherwise – buses or no buses – the election campaign could begin to look like one-way traffic.","A red Labour party bus with 'VOTE LABOUR' written on it, surrounded by people waving and smiling, with a man in a suit and tie standing in front of the bus.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BA3033C10>,2024-06-02 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/02/labour-conservative-battle-buses-sunak-starmer,['Politics'],[0.95],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/9444924d40.png

Good morning,

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz projects the image of an average guy, and when it comes to his finances, that certainly appears to be the case.

Kamala Harris’ new running mate is the least wealthy politician on a major party ticket this election cycle, worth just over $1 million, Forbes estimates. The former public school teacher’s net worth is not far off that of the median American around his age: about $540,000.

In other ways, the makeup of his fortune is atypical: Walz and his wife Gwen don’t appear to own any real estate, and on his most recent state disclosures, he didn’t report owning any stocks.

Let’s get into the headlines,

FIRST UP

U.S. stock markets experienced a turbulent Wednesday, with the S&P 500 and other major indexes reversing morning gains to finish lower in the afternoon, highlighting investor anxiety over economic uncertainties. Despite the downturn, the rise in long-term Treasury yield points to investor confidence in the economy’s resilience against a recession.

The family of explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet is suing OceanGate for gross negligence, seeking over $50 million for failing to reveal the Titan submersible’s safety flaws before its fatal implosion near the Titanic wreck. The lawsuit contends that OceanGate was aware of the sub’s technical issues, including its faulty wireless electronics system.

Computer scientist Zooko Wilcox, the 50-year-old founder of privacy blockchain Zcash, is often counted among crypto’s founding fathers, but in December, he resigned from his languishing privacy-centric blockchain. Now, Wilcox has revealed to Forbes that he will join a Swiss-based nonprofit, aiming to fix Zcash from the outside.

TECH + INNOVATION ​​

Weaknesses in some of the world’s biggest internet browsers gave hackers a route into internal networks for the last 18 years, new research has found. Chrome, Safari and Firefox all accept queries to an 0.0.0.0 IP address by sending them to other addresses, including the “localhost” server that is typically private. Hackers exploited this weakness by sending malicious requests to their target’s 0.0.0.0 IP address, but Apple, Google and Mozilla are working on ways to close the loophole.

MONEY + POLITICS

Former President Donald Trump said Wednesday he will debate Vice President Kamala Harris “in the pretty near future,” after previously indicating he would not participate in a planned debate on ABC in September. In an appearance on Fox & Friends, he repeated his push for Fox News to host a debate, but didn’t explicitly rule out a face-off hosted by another network.

SPORTS + ENTERTAINMENT

Disney’s stock slid to a nine-month low after the company warned of softness in its lucrative parks division during its quarterly earnings update, sending shares further into their yearslong rut. Disney management, including CEO Bob Iger, alluded to weakening consumer spending—a flashing red warning sign to a market already concerned about a global economic slowdown.

SCIENCE + HEALTHCARE

More doses of Novo Nordisk’s popular weight loss drug Wegovy are back in stock in the U.S. after years of shortages, according to the FDA, days after all dosage levels of Eli Lilly’s rival injection Zepbound became available. They’re part of a promising and growing class of drugs called GLP-1 agonists, but shortages are set to persist as pharmaceutical companies struggle to ramp up production.

The Earth experienced its second hottest month and second hottest July on record last month with global average temperatures being slightly lower than July 2023—ending a dire 13-month streak of record-breaking temperatures. Despite the end of the streak, the planet experienced its two hottest days on record on July 22 and 23, with global average temperatures hitting 62.89 and 62.87 degrees Fahrenheit respectively.

DAILY COVER STORY

This Billionaire Beer Baron Wants To Rebuild The Philippines

TOPLINE The Philippines’ San Miguel Corporation is best known for its eponymous 134-year old beer brand, but now it has repositioned itself as a nation builder under chairman Ramon Ang.

In March, it won a $2.9 billion contract to upgrade and operate Manila’s aging Ninoy Aquino International Airport, the country’s main gateway, even while it’s halfway through constructing the new, $12.7 billion Bulacan airport, roughly 40 kilometers north of the capital city. The same month, San Miguel Global Power Holdings announced a three-way partnership to develop a $3.3 billion integrated liquified natural gas facility in Batangas province, south of Manila.

This buzzing pipeline of infrastructure projects has made San Miguel the most indebted company in the Philippines today, with a staggering debt load of $26 billion as of 2023. The company’s debt-to-equity ratio of 2.2 is more than twice the gearing of the country’s biggest conglomerates such as Ayala Corp. and SM Investments, according to Bloomberg data.

But Ang, who’s also the company’s single largest shareholder and features among the country’s wealthiest with a $3.8 billion fortune, is undaunted.

For Ang, 70, the pivot is a chance to cement his legacy—reengineering the food and beverage giant into an infrastructure colossus that is literally remaking the Philippines from the bedrock up. Over the next five years, Ang has earmarked capital expenditure of $24 billion, of which 86%, or $20.8 billion, will be deployed to expand the company’s infrastructure footprint.

WHY IT MATTERS

The overarching goal behind this massive outlay—in a country where infrastructure gaps remain a big challenge, as per the Asian Development Bank—is to boost economic growth in the Philippines, Ang says, by making it a more attractive destination for overseas investors and tourists. That, in turn, will lift consumer spending, boosting San Miguel’s legacy food and beverages business. “When our economy is strong,” Ang says, “when more Filipinos are prosperous, all our businesses benefit.”

529118d8da,Newsmax,"Grim July Fourth: 33 Dead, 11 in Chicago - Newsmax","Shootings and other violence during the extended Fourth of July weekend have left at least 33 people dead, including 11 in Chicago, and injured dozens more nationwide, authorities said.

The Fourth of July historically is one of the nation’s deadliest days of the year. A flurry of shootings around the holiday a year ago left more than a dozen people dead and over 60 wounded. And a year before that, seven people died in a mass shooting at a Fourth of July parade near Chicago.

Violence and mass shootings often increase in the summer months, with more people gathering for social events, teens out of school and hotter temperatures.

In Chicago alone, 11 people had been killed and 55 wounded in shootings as of Friday morning during the extended July Fourth weekend, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. The violence included a mass shooting on Thursday that killed two women and an 8-year-old boy.

The recent violence “has left our city in a state of grief,” Mayor Brandon Johnson said.

A community rally was planned for Friday evening, and the city will beef up police presence over the weekend, Johnson said in a statement.

“We are devastated by the recent violence that has left our city in a state of grief and we extend our heartfelt condolences to the families and communities impacted by these recent events,” Johnson said.

Eight people were wounded in Chicago’s Little Italy neighborhood shortly after midnight Friday. About 90 minutes later, a shooting in the city’s Austin neighborhood injured six. Police said preliminary findings suggest the separate shootings involved an exchange of gunfire between two people who then fled.

Recent violence at a popular Lake Michigan beach in Chicago prompted officials to close it early each night through the holiday weekend as a precaution. The 31st Street Beach has been the scene of recent stabbings and shootings.

In Huntington Beach, California, two people were killed and three others injured in an Independence Day attack less than two hours after a fireworks show ended, police said. Authorities arrested a suspect after responding to reports of an assault with a deadly weapon Thursday night.

In the northeastern Ohio community of Niles, Police Chief Jay Holland said a 15-year-old male was in custody after a 23-year-old man was fatally shot Thursday night at a Fourth of July party at a residence.

A 10-year-old girl, identified as Gracie Griffin, was fatally shot in a Cleveland neighborhood, police said. It is not yet known what sparked the shooting or if she was targeted.

A 19-year-old man was killed and six others were wounded in a drive-by shooting in Philadelphia on Thursday night.

The wounded, which included four juveniles, were being treated at hospitals for various injuries that were not considered life-threatening. It is not known yet what prompted the shooting.

Three shootings occurred in the Boston area following the city's Fourth of July celebrations, leaving one man dead. The fatal shooting occurred about 1:30 a.m. Friday in a park near Boston’s South End neighborhood. At about the same time, three other people were wounded in the city’s Jamaica Plain neighborhood. A third shooting at a gas station later left a victim with life-threatening injuries.

A 17-year-old male suffered a stomach wound in another shooting Thursday night in a condominium parking lot in East Bridgewater, Massachusetts.

In Connecticut, a woman was found shot in her car early Friday and was pronounced dead at a hospital. Police identified her as Shamyria Williams, 23, of Hartford. Relatives told reporters they believed she had just left a Fourth of July party.

Police in Albany, New York, said six males ranging in age from 16 to 19 were being treated at a hospital for injuries that were not considered life-threatening after a shooting at a large gathering.

Police responded to reports of a shooting at a home around 12:15 a.m. Friday. None of the victims were found at the scene but police said they located evidence consistent with gunfire in the yard behind the residence and in the street.

One teenager who had been shot flagged down officers along a street a short time later, police said.

Four people were wounded in a shooting early Friday outside a Tampa adult nightclub after an altercation between the club’s security guard and two men, police said.

The two men drove their car to the front of the Pink Pussycat Lounge and one of them shot the security guard with a handgun, police said. The security guard underwent surgery at a hospital and was in stable condition. Three other men suffered unspecified minor injuries. Police said both suspects were arrested and charged with several crimes.

In the Queens section of New York, an 8-year-old boy was fatally stabbed in an apartment in what police described as a domestic dispute. Police said officers later fatally shot a 20-year-old man who held a knife to his 43-year-old father’s throat and refused commands to drop the weapon.

In High Point, North Carolina, a shooting at an unofficial fireworks display left one person dead after a large crowd had gathered in the parking lot of the city about 90 miles (145 kilometers) west of Raleigh, police said. The victim was identified as Keith S. Lynch, 32, of High Point.

Shootings at two St. Louis-area Fourth of July gatherings left two men dead and five others injured, two critically, police said.

In West Virginia, Charles Speer, 42, of Kermit, died early Friday after being shot multiple times following a physical altercation at the home of another man, state police said.

And a road-rage incident led to the fatal shooting of a 36-year-old man in Taneytown, Maryland, according to the Carroll County Sheriff's Office.

Earlier Thursday, a police officer serving a warrant in Cleveland and an armed person making threats in Yellowstone National Park were among those killed in other shootings.","People are gathered outdoors, watching fireworks and a large American flag.

2f1d713878,Newsmax,Prosecutors: Cartel Paid CBP Agents to Let Drugs Into US - Newsmax,"Two U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers have been accused of working for a Mexican drug trafficking organization to allow vehicles loaded with fentanyl, heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine to pass unchecked through their inspection lanes in southern California.

Prosecutors allege Jesse Clark Garcia and Diego Bonillo ""profited handsomely,"" earning tens of thousands of dollars for each drug-laden vehicle they ushered into the U.S. without scrutiny, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported Thursday. The name of the drug cartel was not disclosed.

The indictment alleges that Garcia and Bonillo combined allowed more than 1,150 pounds of drugs into the U.S. on five occasions between April 2021 and February of this year. That total only accounts for the drugs that authorities later seized.

Details of the case were partially laid out in a search warrant affidavit unsealed Tuesday in federal court in San Diego, as well as in other filings by prosecutors in recent months, the Union-Tribune reported. The U.S. Attorney's Office in San Diego did not announce the arrests or the indictment as it has in previous cases of law enforcement officers accused, convicted, or sentenced for wrongdoing.

Garcia and Bonillo were arrested in early May after an investigation led by the FBI San Diego field office's Border Corruption Task Force, the Union-Tribune reported.

Their arrests came exactly a month before their former colleague, Leonard Darnell George, went on trial in a similar case. A federal jury convicted George in June of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in exchange for allowing smugglers to bring drugs and illegal immigrants through his inspection lane at the San Ysidro Port of Entry, just across the border from Tijuana.

Court records showed that Mexican authorities arrested Garcia and turned him over on May 2 to U.S. authorities at the Arizona border, the Union-Tribune reported. Prosecutors alleged that in late March, Garcia crossed into Mexico with a packed vehicle and did not return to the U.S. until he was in custody. Prosecutors said during that time, Garcia didn't show up for work and his CBP supervisors didn't know where he was.

Two days later, FBI agents arrested Bonillo in Las Vegas, where prosecutors alleged he was staying at the posh ARIA Resort and Casino and had $2,000 tickets to the May 4 boxing match between Canelo Alvarez and Jaime Munguia.

Garcia and Bonillo have pleaded not guilty and remain in custody after judges ruled both were flight risks, the Union-Tribune reported. Garcia's attorney declined to comment Wednesday. Bonillo's attorney did not respond to a request for comment.

A third defendant in the case remains a fugitive; that defendant's name is sealed but is not believed to be a CBP officer.

""Corruption undermines the integrity of our border security and poses a grave threat to public safety,"" U.S. Attorney Tara McGrath told the Union-Tribune in a statement Wednesday. ""Allegations that border officials are complicit in fentanyl trafficking are especially troubling. This office will bring those who put our community at risk to justice.""

A CBP spokesperson did not respond to questions from the Union-Tribune about the officers, including their employment status with the agency.

""We do not tolerate misconduct within our ranks,"" the spokesperson said. ""When we discover any alleged or potential misconduct, we immediately refer it for investigation and cooperate fully with any criminal or administrative investigations. This is the case whether the alleged misconduct occurs on or off duty. Federal privacy laws prohibit discussion of individual cases.""","The image shows a building with a sign that reads 'U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION' and a window with the number '1300' visible.

7877ff93bb,The Associated Press,What to know about delta-8 and other common vape shop drugs - The Associated Press,"They’re sold in gas stations, vape shops, online and in other stores around the country in seemingly countless enticing forms: gummies, chocolate bars, chips. Their packaging lists things like delta-8 THC, micro- and macrodoses of “psychedelics” and “nootropics.”

These substances are often sold through legal loopholes, despite concerns about potential health risks and a lack of oversight of how they’re produced. And in the absence of federal rules, many states have banned or have tried to ban delta-8 THC.

Legal but under-regulated drugs are easy to come by, but experts say there are still a lot of uncertainties. Here’s what to know.

How are these substances legal?

Drug laws are often specific to the substance, so federal and state regulators are left chasing the newest chemical concoction.

Delta-8 THC exploded in popularity under the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, more commonly known as the Farm Bill. Under that law, hemp products and the cannabinoids that could be made from them were classified as distinct from marijuana.

Delta-8 has just a slight chemical tweak from the psychoactive delta-9 compound found in marijuana, but it can still get you high.

It remains in a legally ambiguous area with restrictions that vary state by state, said Robert Mikos, a marijuana policy and law expert at Vanderbilt University. Substances like cannabinoids are also easy to change into new but similar versions of drugs that may come under scrutiny.

“There’s been all sorts of things that (have) cycled through popularity over time,” he said. “And government enforcement is always one step behind what the chemists can come up with.”

If it’s on a store shelf though, it’s safe, right?

Not necessarily.

Because of a lack of oversight into manufacturing processes and a lack of uniform labeling requirements, it’s hard to know what exactly is in a particular product.

For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration began investigating illnesses earlier this year caused by recalled Diamond Shruumz products, which in addition to containing muscimol, a legal psychoactive compound from the Amanita muscaria mushroom, were found to contain other unlisted ingredients, including psilocin, a controlled substance.

It’s hard to even know basic information about what the potency of the drug in many of these products is, said Dr. Ginger Nicol, who leads the psychedelics research program at Washington University in St. Louis.

And the concern isn’t just limited to the drugs themselves: It extends to other things that could be introduced in the manufacturing process, said Dr. Igor Grant, director of the University of California, San Diego’s Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research.

He pointed to how delta-8 is made from CBD.

The chemical process to make delta-8 uses strong acids and more, Grant said, and if some of those other trace chemicals are left behind, they can pose added health risks to those already posed by delta-8 itself.

“If this was done by the Food and Drug Administration’s standards where they have strong regulations about purity and all that, it’d probably be fine,” he said. “But that’s not how it’s made.”

What should you do?

Nicol suggested that people to talk to their doctor before taking anything, especially if it’s an unregulated drug.

That’s in part because of the lack of rigorous research that could better understand the drugs’ effects, side effects and safety — and in part because there is so little oversight.

“You can get a bad batch,” she said. “Nobody is necessarily testing it for purity or contamination.”

d41894e6c8,ABC News,How AAPI social media influencers are working to mobilize voters in 2024 - ABC News,"As the largest growing group of eligible voters in the United States, the Asian American Pacific Islanders vote will be crucial in the upcoming election. In an effort to harness that vote, several organizations are launching campaigns with influencers who have large AAPI followings to mobilize voters ahead of November.

Ameya Okamoto, a New York-based nail artist who specializes in bold, concept-driven sculpture nail art, is one of those influencers.

""I did nail art, kind of inspiring and calling to the Asian American community to kind of turn up for the midterms, which I think a lot of people don't think enough about,"" Okamoto said about one of her videos created for a campaign run by Run AAPI, a nonpartisan nonprofit organization.

Campaigns from groups such as Run AAPI and Asian American Futures are seeking to take advantage of the growing Asian American Native-Hawaiian Pacific Islander population in the U.S., which has grown 81% from 2000 to 2019. About 15 million Asian Americans are projected to be eligible to vote in 2024 -- a number that has ballooned by 15%, or roughly 2 million voters, in the last four years, according to Pew Research Center. About 15 million Asian Americans are projected to be eligible to vote in 2024, Pew Research Center found.

This summer, these campaigns will especially look to recruit influencers with large AAPI followings in battleground states. Thao Nguyen, a Georgia-based TikToker with more than 400,000 followers, was recruited for a pilot version of Run AAPI's summer campaign in 2022.

She used a ""red flags"" trend -- describing a list of turnoffs -- to bring up the topic of voting.

""No. 3: people who don't care about politics. I don't understand why people sit at home and complain about things that were different in their community when they could just go vote for somebody that stands for that,"" she said in the video, which has more than 14,000 views.

Run AAPI Executive Director Linh Nguyen said the organization -- as well as other similar organizations -- are looking for influencers in areas with multiple AAPI candidates as well. She said they are looking to target areas such as Orange County, California, where Reps. Young Kim and Michelle Steel are both fighting to keep their seats and State Sen. Dave Min is looking to replace Rep. Katie Porter.

The hope, Linh Nguyen said, is to signal something bigger within the young AAPI community.

""Generally the younger Asian American community, like we are shaping everyday life, right?"" she said. ""And whether that's shaping political life, political representation, how we see ourselves in entertainment, on the news, how we're represented in so many other facets of life.""

For the 2023 midterm election, Linh Nguyen reached out to Okamoto, who lives near New York's 3rd Congressional District. Asian American voters make up more than 20% of voters in the area, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau.

This February, Tom Suozzi, a Democrat, won that district's congressional seat in a special election to replace ousted Republican Rep. George Santos. Souzzi's campaign dedicated resources to reaching the AAPI community, which, Linh Nguyen said, highlights how candidates should be targeting growing, young diverse communities.

""They are the next generation of political thought leaders. They're the ones who are going to change the whole policy landscape, how we think of governance,"" Linh Nguyen said. ""But it really does live online. And it's exciting to see that come into play.""

Okamoto said she was grateful for the chance to be part of ""something bigger"" with her posts. She said she's glad to use her platform to get out the AAPI vote, especially at a time when she's finally feeling more proud of her Japanese heritage.

""A lot of my clientele are young Asian American girls and a lot of them find me through social media. And a lot of our conversations are about family and identity, and how we show up in the world physically, because that has kind of become a big part of my art practice,"" Okamoto said. ""What are the choices that you are allowed to make that feel empowering to you?

Our job in the run-up to polling day is to ensure you have all the information you need to make your choice come 4 July.

In planning our coverage we take account of the key issues and questions, giving centre stage to the main topics and themes that voters tell us matter to them. Our teams are out and about across Wales reporting on the ground, getting to grips with local issues and how the parties are responding.

At the same time we are reflecting and scrutinising the broader picture in Wales and putting that in the wider context of the UK.

Reporting on a UK general election when we live in a devolved nation brings its own challenges. It is critical that we explain and give clarity on what is and is not devolved to avoid confusion.

Importantly, we want to give you, the voters, an opportunity to hold politicians to account and ask your questions of the representatives of the political parties during the campaign.

It is a vital part of our mission. Providing a platform for debate and discourse where everyone is treated fairly and with respect and where everyone’s views are heard is a vital part of the BBC’s duty as a public service broadcaster.

Want to take part? Why not join Bethan Rhys Roberts as she hosts the BBC Wales Election Debate live on Friday, 21 June at 19:00BST. If you’d like to request to be in the audience in Cardiff please apply online.

The parties have confirmed their representatives. They are: Welsh Labour – Vaughan Gething; Welsh Conservatives – David TC Davies; Plaid Cymru - Rhun ap Iorwerth; Welsh Liberal Democrats – Jane Dodds; Reform – Oliver Lewis.

As always, we will ensure the audience reflects the broad electoral map of Wales, with questions representing the broad concerns of Welsh citizens, fair to all of the political representatives and are not too focused on a particular party or manifesto. The presenters are asked to ensure everyone gets a fair hearing while holding the politicians to account.

If you are watching from home, the debate is live on BBC One Wales, BBC iPlayer and BBC Radio Wales at 19:00BST, and look out for the additional coverage with a digital live page with all the analysis and reaction to the debate.

You may be wondering how we decide which parties are represented in debates. Parties have been invited to participate in the BBC Wales Election Debate in line with the BBC’s election guidance as well as Ofcom’s guidance. These guidelines are online.

Participation takes account of a number of considerations, including past electoral performance in equivalent elections over at least two electoral cycles, as well as giving due weight to robust patterns in relevant opinion polls. It also takes account of the number of constituencies in which each party is fielding candidates.

The debate is one of the ways in which we are covering the issues you are concerned about in Wales. You can also turn to in-depth interviews, analysis and expert opinion.

We know you can access your news in so many ways – and whether you prefer to follow every twist and turn of the election trail on television, radio or on our apps and digital services, you can depend on us to deliver trusted news, your way.

As a trusted news provider, BBC Wales is here to give you everything you need to make up your mind.

63aca8a94b,The New York Times,‘The Interview’: The Darker Side of Julia Louis-Dreyfus - The New York Times,"At some point in almost every performance she gives, Julia Louis-Dreyfus has this look. If you’ve watched “Seinfeld,” “The New Adventures of Old Christine” or “Veep,” you know it — the perfect mix of irritation and defiance. As if she were saying, Try me.

Louis-Dreyfus’s performances in those shows — from the eccentrically self-actualized Elaine Benes in “Seinfeld” to the completely un-self-aware Selina Meyer in “Veep” — were comedic master classes. But in recent years, she has been moving toward more introspective and serious work. Still, that “try me” vibe remains. She hosts a wonderful hit podcast called “Wiser Than Me,” in which she interviews older, famous, often (necessarily) sharp-elbowed women — Billie Jean King, Sally Field, Carol Burnett and Debbie Allen, to name a few — about their lives and careers and the crap they’ve all navigated. Last year she starred as a frustrated novelist and wife in the writer-director Nicole Holofcener’s movie “You Hurt My Feelings,” the second collaboration between the two women about the struggles of middle age. In her newest movie, “Tuesday,” which opens nationwide on June 14, Louis-Dreyfus plays a mother whose teenage daughter has a terminal illness. It’s a surreal, dark fairy tale that she was nervous about taking on. (She’s also got a recurring role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe: She was shooting “Thunderbolts” when we talked.)

You’re in a new Marvel film at the moment. It must be a very different kind of set to be on. What’s it like? It’s very well organized. Very methodical. And I don’t mean that in a negative way. Particularly on this film, they’re very much focused on, frankly, the human story, believe it or not. They’re trying to sort of go back to their roots, as it were. And so there’s a lot of focus on that. They’re trying to stay away from as much C.G.I. or whatever as possible, so that the stunts are, like, everywhere. And in fact, I had to do a couple.

What stunts have you done? Well, I’m making this out to sound like I’m flying through the air like Captain America or whatever, but I’m not. It’s just a very, very, very, very brief stunt.

Do you have complicated feelings about what the superhero franchises have done to films in general? Because when you’ve chosen to do films lately, they’ve been smaller films, more intimate films, and then you have these massive franchises that have taken over in so many ways. I’m just wondering how you look at that. I look at it gratefully. Look, there’s no guarantee that just because a movie is in a franchise, it’s going to work. There’s scores of examples of exactly that. And even in the Marvel universe, they’ve had some clunkers. So I’m not sure that the size of a franchise is the problem with the entertainment business. Corporations eating up corporations eating up corporations may be more of the problem, but not the franchise itself, if that makes sense.

You mean the consolidation in the industry with less competition? And lots of cooks and lots of people with opinions. And so a new idea or an independent idea or an outside-the-box idea is harder to sell, to make, it seems.

Well, let’s talk about “Tuesday,” your new film, because that is exactly the opposite. It’s a small film. You play the mother of a terminally ill teenager. But this is also a fantasy film, in that death is portrayed by a talking parrot. Why did you want to do this film? I was immediately intrigued by it, because it was so unusual. And the themes of the film captivated my imagination: loss and grief and motherhood and denial and death and dying. Daina Pusić, who wrote this film and directed it, captured this way of exploring these themes, using magical realism to tell the story. I’m not going to lie, I was nervous about it, because it’s very strange.

You said that you were interested in exploring these ideas. Can you tell me why? Well, they’re fundamental. It’s funny how we’re all going to die, and everyone we know is going to die, and yet we do not waste any time really thinking about that. And I probably shouldn’t use the word “waste,” but we don’t think about it a lot. And maybe it’s a good thing, but it is amazing because we all have that in common. And it’s not something you go through life considering a lot. I’ve lost people very close to me in my life. And those losses are hard to reconcile. Still are. I’ve given birth to two children, and I don’t want to be misunderstood, but there’s something about giving birth and the awesomeness of that, and then when my father died and I was with him when he died, there is a similar thing, the waiting. I was struck by how similar that was, in certain ways, to waiting for a baby to come. It has a mystery to it that is undeniable, as does the birth of a person. And, you know, I myself had cancer. The idea of that sort of coming to knock on your door was alarming, shall we say, which is the understatement of the century. So for all those reasons, I was intrigued by this film.

Did your brush with cancer give you a different relationship with your own mortality? I don’t have an arrogant sense of my immortality anymore, the way you do when you’re 20 — I don’t feel like that anymore. I feel a little more present and a little more grateful.

In “Tuesday,” you have this scene where you say to your daughter, “I don’t know who I am without you, what the world is without you in it.” It’s a devastating line, because I think any parent knows how unimaginable it is to experience the loss of a child. How did you, while you were making this film, experience that yourself? I mean, what were you tapping into? Stuff I didn’t want to tap into. I don’t want to sound too actor-y.

Please, sound actor-y. No, I don’t like that. But I was on location, we shot this in London. So I was not with my family. And those few days that we shot the pivotal scenes, I had to call home a lot. I really was a tad unhinged. It was a hard place to go in my mind. Even though it’s pretend, and I recognize that, and I’m not in any way implying that it’s not pretend, you do have to flirt emotionally with stuff in a very real way to give authenticity to a performance, and it was a hard thing to do. And it was a hard thing to recover from after.

I recently heard an episode of “Wiser Than Me” in which you interviewed Patti Smith, and you talked about the different ways that you’ve processed the death of people in your own life. Have the conversations you’ve been having on your podcast helped you process the many ways people deal with the hard things in their life? Yeah, it’s really one of the many impetuses to making this podcast, because all of these women I’m talking to have lived very full, long lives. And that of course means they’ve experienced loss. And I’m really interested to talk to them about how they move beyond it or with it or into it. I’m just loving those conversations, to hear from these women who have experienced an enormous amount of life.

I find what’s comforting about them, and sometimes a little depressing, is how many of the same themes — sexism, prejudice, self-doubt — they have experienced themselves. What is your takeaway from hearing these women having gone through so many of the things that we’re still going through? There’s a sense with most of them, not everybody, but there’s a sense of, OK, I’m done with that [expletive]. I don’t know if we can swear.

You can swear. But anyway, I’m done with that. I’m done with self-doubt. I’m done with shame. I’m done with feeling weird about being ambitious. You know, the list is long. We all know what it is. I think for me, the takeaway is: Oh, we can be done with that sooner than we thought. We don’t have to take 60, 70 [expletive] years to come to that conclusion.

I like the way you paused and really thought about your wording, because you said, “I’m done with,” and then you said, “I’m working on being done with … ” Well, I haven’t accomplished all of this yet! Old habits die hard.

Your mom appears on the podcast. And you’ve talked about going to therapy with her when you were 60 and she was 87. Talk me through why she agreed to this, because I’ve laid my differences with my mom, who’s 85, aside. I figure she’s that age and she isn’t going to change, but maybe I’m thinking about this wrong. I went to therapy with my mother because she said something to me. It might have been my dad’s birthday — my dad who had passed, and she was remembering that it was his birthday — and she said: “I’m sure you’re thinking about your dad. And I know there was stuff there that I wish we’d been able to deal with or talk about when you were younger.” Because my parents were divorced. “I wish we’d had a chance to do that.” And I said: “Oh, well, mom, what’s keeping us? Why don’t we do it?” And so off we went. And it was very, very helpful. It’s not like everything becomes perfect, but that’s not possible under any circumstances. But it was an opportunity to communicate in maybe a more honest way, and in a safe way that was helpful to both of us. And I have no regrets about it. So if you’re thinking about it with your mom, and if you think your mother would be into it, I encourage you to do it, because you might not have the opportunity in 10 years, and you might think, Oh, if only.

Did it heal things? Unresolved things? Did you see her differently after that? Yes.

I know I’m asking you a lot of personal questions. I assume you’re going to charge me after this.

I am. But it’s because you’ve been very open on your podcast. I know. Huge mistake.

Do you feel that? It’s weird. I don’t know. I’ve never done anything like this. It sort of surprises me a little bit. I’m incredibly private — I really am. So it is sort of a strange thing. But I also don’t have any regrets about what I’ve shared on the podcast. It is new territory for me, but it’s also good. I think it engenders a way of thinking about communication that might be good. I don’t know.

All right, let’s get out of the heavy stuff. Would you do another long-running TV series, something funny? Are you open to that now? Yes, I am. Maybe a limited series might be a little more doable right now, because to get locked into an eight-year run on something might be a little daunting, but people aren’t doing that anymore anyway. You know, everything is much shorter-lived, it seems, entertainmentwise.

Could “Seinfeld” be made now? Probably not. I mean, what the hell is happening in network television anymore? When “Seinfeld” was made, it was really unlike anything that was on at the time. It was just a bunch of losers hanging out. So I would say one main reason it wouldn’t be made now is because it’s hard to get anything different recognized. Particularly nowadays, everyone’s sort of running scared.

Is there an unlikable part of you that you bring? Wouldn’t it be funny if as you said that horns came up out of my head and my tongue rolled out, and it was like a spiked tongue? Um, yes, I am unlikable.

Not that you’re unlikable! I think you’re lovely. What I’m saying is, for example, I think that — and I am quite proud of this — I’m a pretty prickly person. So I guess that’s what I’m asking: Is it because you’re too nice in real life that you’re drawn to these characters, or that you’re maybe a difficult person and you are drawn to them because that kind of exemplifies something about yourself? Well, I don’t think I’m a difficult person. I wonder what other people would say. I am an opinionated person. I have strong opinions and strong instincts. And, um, I think you’re awful, Lulu! [Laughs]

Thank you, Julia! You’re a prickly [expletive], is what you are. [Laughs] But anyway, I am not like these people I play, but I am interested in some aspect of myself — for example, with Selina Meyer, she was essentially 2 years old and thought that the world revolved around her and any mistake she made was simply not her own. And that’s a fun ego thing to tap into, to not consider anyone else around you other than yourself. And what does that mean when somebody does that? It means, obviously, they haven’t been well nurtured. That goes without saying. But it’s also an incredibly funny place to start with a character.

You know, talking about “Veep,” it does make me wonder about political satire, and how hard it is nowadays to be funny about politics. Your former co-star Jerry Seinfeld recently made news for talking about political correctness in comedy. I’m wondering, as a famous comedian yourself, what you think about that. If you look back on comedy and drama both, let’s say 30 years ago, through the lens of today, you might find bits and pieces that don’t age well. And I think to have an antenna about sensitivities is not a bad thing. It doesn’t mean that all comedy goes out the window as a result. When I hear people starting to complain about political correctness — and I understand why people might push back on it — but to me that’s a red flag, because it sometimes means something else. I believe being aware of certain sensitivities is not a bad thing. I don’t know how else to say it.

Are there things that no longer feel funny to you that once did, or things that are funny now that you didn’t notice before? Oh, that’s a good question. We’re going to have to revisit that question, because I don’t quite know how to answer it.

Well, we are going to speak again. In our next session, doctor, we’ll discuss it then.

Eleven days later, I called Julia back.

I was wondering if you’ve been thinking about anything from our previous conversation. I wanted to make sure that I answered this whole idea of political correctness correctly, and I can’t really remember what I said. So I wanted to go back to that and be very clear about where I stand. My feeling about all of it is that political correctness, insofar as it equates to tolerance, is obviously fantastic. And of course I reserve the right to boo anyone who says anything that offends me, while also respecting their right to free speech, right? But the bigger problem — and I think the true threat to art and the creation of art — is the consolidation of money and power. All this siloing of studios and outlets and streamers and distributors — I don’t think it’s good for the creative voice. So that’s what I want to say in terms of the threat to art.

You said last time it wasn’t a bad thing to have sensitivity in comedy. Do you think it makes comedy better, that people are now more attuned to how some of their comments might be received? I can’t judge if it’s better or not. I just know that the lens through which we create art today — and I’m not going to just specify it to comedy, it’s also drama — it’s a different lens. It really is. Even classically wonderful, indisputably great films from the past are riddled with attitudes that today would not be acceptable. So I think it’s just good to be vigilant. I mean, pretend this show, your show, “The Interview,” was being made 40 years ago. I would posit that diversity would not be something you would be considering in terms of the guests that you would bring to the show. So that’s interesting, isn’t it? I mean, things have shifted. And in that case, I would say, things have shifted very much for the good. And also, actually, Lulu, probably you wouldn’t be the host.

I think, Julia, you’re probably right. I think I’m probably right.

So what I was thinking about our previous conversation was a moment where I asked you about “unlikability.” And I was thinking that I used the wrong word. What I was trying to get at was how I’ve always admired the sharp edges that you bring to your characters. Does that description ring a little bit more true to you? Yeah. I don’t play good girls. I don’t play girls who behave a way that a good girl should behave. If they do, they do it with bitterness and anxiety. I’ve played a lot of characters who push back on the position that they’re in, who are not content with their place in the world. And that’s real. Women are having their rights taken away. And women are not content, and I play women like that.","A black and white image of a person with long hair, cropped to show only the face and part of the shoulders.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x117 at 0x7D6B7E6676D0>,2024-06-08 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/08/magazine/julia-louis-dreyfus-interview.html,['Entertainment'],[0.95],Unlikely,Likely,sample_review/images/63aca8a94b.png
7ae2393532,The New York Times,Texas Family Finally Learns Fate of Man Held in Syria - The New York Times,"Since an American therapist from Texas disappeared while visiting Syria in 2017, his family has navigated years of milestones in uncertainty: his 41st wedding anniversary, the births of four grandchildren, his wife’s cancer diagnosis.

Earlier this month, at a hotel in Washington, national security officials told the family that highly credible, classified information indicated the therapist, Majd Kamalmaz, had died in captivity, held in one of the world’s most notorious prison systems.

Mr. Kamalmaz’s relatives intend to grieve soon, finally, at a mosque and at the family’s home in Grand Prairie, Texas. They had hoped for a different outcome, but now that they have accepted the news, his daughters said they would fight to hold Syria accountable for their father’s detainment and death. The family plans to sue the Syrian government for damages and to seek justice for others still in detention.

Mr. Kamalmaz is one of several Americans who have disappeared in Syria. Austin Tice, a freelance journalist covering the country’s civil war, was abducted outside Damascus in 2012. Layla Shweikani, 26, an American aid worker, was arrested, accused of terrorism and executed. The Justice Department is investigating her 2016 death as a war crime carried out by Syrian intelligence officials.

Confirmation of Mr. Kamalmaz’s death, which has not previously been reported, underscores the brutal detainment and torture in secret prisons in Syria that have flourished under President Bashar al-Assad. Syria denies that it uses torture and other abuses to silence dissent.

In Syria, citizens and foreigners vanish with no explanation. The government refuses to say whether detainees are alive or dead, and it uses them as tacit leverage in negotiations with the West. When U.S. officials traveled to Syria in 2020 to discuss the possible release of hostages, including Mr. Kamalmaz, he had likely already died, years earlier. Families are left in limbo, enduring a crushing cycle of hope and despair that can last years.

The Kamalmaz case shows how difficult it is for families and other nations to hold Mr. al-Assad accountable. Most of the world shunned Syria in 2013, after it was accused of using chemical weapons on its own citizens. But it has edged back onto the world stage, strengthening its ties with Iran, China and Russia. Before the war in Gaza, Arab states were reopening lines of communication with Syria.

“Pursuing accountability for Majd is symbolic and a measure of justice” for those detainees who have perished or remain in Syria’s dungeons, said Mouaz Moustafa, the executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, an advocacy group.

Mr. Kamalmaz, then 59, was running a nonprofit in Lebanon helping refugees deal with trauma when he drove to Syria in mid-February 2017 to visit a relative who had cancer. Once in Damascus, he called his wife to tell her that he had arrived safely. The family never heard from him again. As in the case of Mr. Tice, Syria never acknowledged holding Mr. Kamalmaz, and there was little information about his whereabouts.

Syria is “a very dark black box,” said Mr. Kamalmaz’s other daughter, Maryam.

But in January 2020, F.B.I. agents visited the family’s home in Texas. The U.S. government had information that Mr. Kamalmaz had suffered a heart failure in Syria and died, they said.

That summer, members of the family traveled to Washington, where F.B.I. agents showed them a document, written in Arabic, that indicated Mr. Kamalmaz had been taken to the hospital with heart failure but that doctors had failed to revive him. It was dated June 2017.

“The date on that document just blew our mind,” Maryam Kamalmaz said. Her father had been in good health, making his death only four months after being detained appear more improbable. “We questioned that paper because of the date. It didn’t make any sense.”

She added, “How could he suffer from a heart attack and die unless they did something to him?”

The family also sought the help of the Czech ambassador at the time, who often acted as an intermediary since the United States cut off formal diplomatic ties with Syria.

Mr. Moustafa said he and his research team strongly suspect that Mr. Kamalmaz was imprisoned, at least for some of his time in Syria, at a facility at the Mezze air base in Damascus, which is known for its harsh conditions and brutal torture. The complex was then controlled by Jamil Hassan, the leader of the Air Force Intelligence Directorate.

The United States has imposed sanctions on Mr. Hassan, and the Justice Department is investigating him as part of its inquiry into the death of Ms. Shweikani, the aid worker. The German authorities have also sought his arrest.

Years passed with no more insights into what happened to Mr. Kamalmaz. His 41st anniversary came and went in October. His family, including his four children, kept waiting.

Then finality came in early May at a Marriott Courtyard in Washington, at the meeting with U.S. officials, including F.B.I. agents. Eight officials affirmed the sensitive information that led the government to its conclusion. Maryam Kamalmaz declined to specify what the officials had provided her, but she said, “it was convincing after hearing how many levels of investigation it went through.”

She pressed each official. After more than two hours, her doubts had dissipated. “There is no more hope,” she said.","A woman in a headscarf speaks at a protest with a banner reading 'These are American prisons' behind her.

bed0da4744,New York Post,Stephen A. Smith opens up on Skip Bayless-ESPN speculation after ‘Undisputed’ bombshell - New York Post,"Skip Bayless might have “saved” Stephen A. Smith’s career, but those days — and the two working together — are a “far cry away,” according to the “First Take” personality, who addressed the topic on Friday.

After eight years, Bayless is soon leaving FS1’s “Undisputed,” The Post first reported, which sent shockwaves in the sports media world — with man wondering what his next move would be.

Smith, on his eponymous podcast, shut down any notion that he would work with Bayless again at ESPN — or anywhere, for that matter.

“Skip Bayless and Stephen A. Smith, together as partners, working across from each other on a debate show, is over. It’s been over,” Smith said.

“This is not the first time I’ve said it. There’s no negativity or shade being shown at Skip Bayless. I have moved on.”

Smith let his viewers know that there would be no TV reunion.

“I’m past all of that,” Smith said. “And me connecting and reigniting things with Skip Bayless is not what I want my future to be. That is a past that I’ll always celebrate and be appreciative of, but that ain’t where I’m at now. I got bigger plans for myself that don’t include him nor anybody else as a partner.”

Smith had previously mentioned on his show on Wednesday that the two haven’t talked in a long time, as Bayless left ESPN for FS1 in 2016.

“He’s on that side of the fence, I’m on this side of the fences,” Smith said, as reported by Awful Announcing.

Before Smith provided his take on the situation, an ESPN spokesperson had already closed the “First Take” door on Bayless.

“We are set with the current ‘First Take’ rotation, and wish Skip the best on his future endeavors,” the network told Front Office Sports this week.

Smith claimed he was not made aware of ESPN’s statement before it went public, but at the same time, he said his answer would have been the same.

The 72-year-old Bayless will have his final show later this summer, which means — for now — he will be left rudderless until he secures another position.

Smith, who sounded very adamant, also sprinkled some care into his message.

“But as I’ve stated on many occasions… I don’t root against my colleagues and contemporaries and certainly not my friends,” Smith said. “Being on ‘First Take’ and wanting to be No. 1 doesn’t mean I wanted Skip Bayless to fail, doesn’t mean that I want to see him out of the business.”","A man in a suit sits in front of a brick wall with a purple line to the left, and a cityscape in the background.

An Aug. 25 Facebook post (direct link, archive link) shows quotes purportedly from Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz about gun restrictions.

""'I will use an executive order to end the second amendment.' – Kamala Harris,"" one quote reads.

""'We will confiscate all weapons of war starting with AR15's.' – Tim Walz,"" reads the other.

The post includes photos of Harris and Walz, the Democratic nominees for president and vice president, set against the Venezuelan flag.

The post was shared more than 300 times in five days.

More from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook page

Our rating: False

The quotes are fabricated. There is no credible evidence that Harris or Walz made the statements attributed to them.

Harris and Walz support gun control policies, but quotes are fabricated

Harris' campaign website says the Biden-Harris administration enacted ""the first meaningful gun safety reform in decades,"" referring to a bipartisan bill President Joe Biden signed into law in June 2022, a month after the elementary school shooting in Uvalde, Texas. The law enhances background checks on gun buyers who are 18–21 years old, encourages states to develop better ""red flag"" laws and adds dating partners to the list of domestic abusers who are prohibited from buying firearms.

The vice president also took on a visible role addressing gun safety in Biden's administration. She oversaw the newly created White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, which the White House said focuses on implementing executive and legislative action to ""end the scourge of gun violence in America.""

And during her first presidential rally of the 2024 election cycle, Harris said she would work to ""finally pass red flag laws, universal background checks and an assault weapons ban.""

But there is no evidence Harris has said she would ""use an executive order to end the Second Amendment,"" as claimed in the Facebook post. No reliable news outlets reported that Harris made the purported statement. The post also doesn't provide a source of the supposed quote.

And while Harris pledged in 2019 during her first presidential campaign to take executive action on guns, she did not say she would end or repeal the Second Amendment, a move the National Constitution Center says would require a constitutional amendment. Article V of the Constitution lays out the requirements to propose and ratify such an amendment, none of which allow the president to unilaterally change the Constitution.

During a CNN presidential town hall in 2019, Harris said if Congress didn't act within 100 days upon her taking office, she would take executive action to institute new background check requirements for certain gun sellers, empower the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to revoke licenses from gun dealers who break the law and implement purchase restrictions for fugitives.

Fact check: Supposed Harris pledge to harm 'Trumpers,' ignore Constitution is fabricated

As Minnesota's governor, Walz has also been a proponent of stricter gun control measures. In 2023, he signed into law restrictions on firearm possession and purchases, including subjecting more gun sales to background checks and implementing ""red flag"" protections to keep guns out of the hands of people deemed to be a danger to themselves or others, Minnesota Public Radio reported.

He's also used the phrase ""weapons of war"" that is mentioned in the Facebook post. In a 2018 video circulated by the Harris campaign, Walz speaks about pushing for background checks, government research on gun violence and making ""sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at."" (The Associated Press reported that the Harris campaign later said Walz misspoke about carrying weapons in a combat zone.)

And footage of Walz saying Minnesota can be part of a national effort to ""get these weapons of war off the streets"" has been circulated on social media by the pro-gun lobby Gun Owners of America.

But like the purported Harris quote, there is no evidence Walz has pledged to ""confiscate all weapons of war starting with AR-15s."" No reliable news outlets reported that Walz made the supposed comment. And the Facebook post provides no source for the alleged quote.

Harris' campaign website describes Walz as a gun owner, hunter and supporter of the Second Amendment who believes Congress must do more to address gun violence.

USA TODAY reached out to the Harris campaign, Walz's gubernatorial office and the Facebook user who shared the post but did not immediately receive responses.

2594d91c7b,The Washington Post,Anger over Oasis ticket prices sparks U.K. review of dynamic pricing - The Washington Post,"When Oasis announced a reunion tour after more than a decade of feuding, the band’s fans were delighted. But after waiting online for hours, many of them were outraged to discover that ticket prices had soared while they were in line — some more than doubling from their originally advertised price.

Now the British government is looking into the practice of dynamic pricing, a model that allows ticket sellers to adjust prices according to real-time demand. Some Oasis tickets were first listed on Ticketmaster at around $180, but when fans were finally able to purchase them, they were priced at more than $460, according to the BBC.

Lisa Nandy, the British culture secretary, said that it was “deeply depressing” for fans to have spent hours queuing online for the “event of a lifetime, that they thought may never happen,” only for many to discover that they could not afford the tickets.

“There is an overhaul needed of the regulations around ticketing. We’ve already announced that this autumn we’ll be consulting on secondary ticketing and how to deal with ticket touts, and as part of that we’ll look at dynamic pricing, and, in particular, transparency around it,” Nandy said in a clip shared Monday by British media.

“Many of those Oasis fans had no idea … that a dynamic pricing model was in use. They thought that they were going to pay one price for a ticket, only to … find that they were paying hundreds of pounds more,” she said.

Oasis, known for hits such as “Wonderwall” and “Don’t Look Back in Anger,” announced its return last month, ending a 15-year hiatus. On Friday, the band started selling tickets for performances in Ireland and the United Kingdom next year, but tickets had sold out by Saturday afternoon local time, according to the band’s official X account.

On social media, fans called out ticket sites and directed some of their anger at Oasis, which has yet to make a statement on the pricing issue. Ticketmaster, one of the vendors for Oasis tickets, could not be immediately reached for comment Tuesday. But the company told the BBC that prices were set by the event organizer and were priced according to their market value.

Dynamic pricing is considered legal so long as businesses do not violate price transparency and antitrust laws. The practice is used by airlines, hotels and ride-sharing apps, among others. The pricing method, as well as other practices in the concert ticking industry, has come under fire in recent years — especially during rushes for high-demand events.

When Bruce Springsteen fans tried to buy tickets to his concert in 2022, some reported finding tickets priced at $5,000. Later that year, astronomically high ticket prices also became a focal point during Ticketmaster’s disastrous rollout of presale tickets for Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour.

Critics say sticker shock can also come from other tactics, such as “drip pricing,” when ticketing platforms add fees to the initial ticket price just before check out. Experts have also pointed to the resale market, which can incentivize scalpers to hoard tickets and raise prices.

U.S. regulators have also taken notice of consumer complaints about ticket prices. In May, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit to break up Live Nation, the conglomerate that runs Ticketmaster, saying it runs a “monopoly” that imposes exorbitant fees on consumers.

Live Nation has vigorously denied charges that it is a monopoly, and sharply criticized the Justice Department’s lawsuit after it was filed.

The fiasco over Swift concert tickets also spurred a raft of proposals from legislators around the United States to lower the cost of concert tickets.","A man walks past a large mural of two men with sunglasses, one of whom is smiling, on a brick wall.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BCBD7B190>,2024-09-03 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2024/09/03/oasis-ticket-sale-pricing-ticketmaster/,['Politics' 'Entertainment'],[0.85 0.75],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/2594d91c7b.png
314f80bc5d,The New Yorker,Is the End of Marriage the Beginning of Self-Knowledge? - The New Yorker,"Sex, like hemlines, follows fashions of its own, if novels are to be believed. The eighteen-hundreds was the peak era for the covert carriage assignation, and early-twentieth-century fiction revelled in sex al fresco—leave your britches on the riverbank, step right in for your marshy and mystical Lawrentian communion. The nineteen-sixties saw some awestruck, and genuinely ghastly, odes to anal sex by Norman Mailer and James Salter (from “A Sport and a Pastime”: “She rolls over and in the full daylight he slowly inserts this gleaming declaration”). Sadism bordering on snuff was all the rage in the nineties, in the work of Dennis Cooper, Heather Lewis, and Susanna Moore. In the past decade, in what has been called the “millennial sex novel,” masochism had a heyday, as sad-eyed young women in books by Sally Rooney, Miranda Popkey, and Raven Leilani slouched forward with plaintive appeals to be hit and hurt, just a little.

And lately? Lately, our heroines can’t keep their hands off themselves. The signature sex act du jour might be the furtive solo session, at least according to new novels such as Miranda July’s “All Fours,” Eva Baltasar’s “Mammoth,” and Kimberly King Parsons’s “We Were the Universe.” “It’s not that I want to masturbate in the vestibule of the Tiny Toads gymnastics class, specifically,” the narrator of Parsons’s novel confesses—and yet. These scenes are very often fun, filthy, hot, and, frankly, a relief after so much doleful, droopy coupling. It might be overkill to mine them for meaning, but their significance feels overt: these self-sufficient women star in stories that are very often about self-understanding, about locating and reasserting an essential identity that’s drowning beneath the commotion of work and family life. It’s been the mood of the moment, to judge by the best-seller lists, on which July’s novel is one of many books about the marital crises of white women in their forties. Memoirs by Leslie Jamison, Maggie Smith, and Lyz Lenz revise the well-worn story in which art-making and child rearing are pitted against each other. Babies, it turns out, have been falsely accused; babies, these writers suggest, were never really to blame. It was the husbands all along—husbands who were useless with the children and domestic duties, who themselves needed constant care, whose envy of their wives’ professional success could drip a slow stream of poison into the marriage. In “Splinters,” Jamison recounts preparing for a nineteen-city book tour. Her husband at the time, also a writer, once told her, “I’ll be damned if I’m going to stand there holding your purse.”

Jane, they’re singing your song. The narrator of Sarah Manguso’s new novel, “Liars” (Hogarth), lies awake next to her husband, dully, resentfully making herself come. “The smell of a woman’s cunt on her own fingers, I wrote in my notebook that night. It felt important,” she tells us. This is what passes for epiphany for the solemn, solitary Jane, who searches for self-knowledge in a woebegone key. She is in full wilt, exhausted by trying (and failing) to balance full-time parenthood with her work as a writer and a teacher, to say nothing of her constant itinerancy; she and her husband, John, move six times in eight years, as he founds (or is fired from) a series of businesses. Feckless, beautiful John. Jane desires him terribly—his heavy limbs and cedar smell, his “raucous black bloom of pubic hair”—even as he squanders their money, even as he refuses to touch her. In the next room, she can hear him on the phone with another woman. Told in tight vignettes, gusts of fury, the novel is not so much the story of the slow implosion of a marriage over the years as it is the black box found amid its wreckage, a play-by-play accounting, from Jane’s point of view, of her own annihilation.

What We’re Reading

Discover notable new fiction and nonfiction.

You’ll recognize Jane. She’s a familiar Manguso character—laconic, deadpan, elaborately controlled (at least at first)—if not a version of the author herself. Manguso’s middle name is Jane, and their lives overlap; several events in the novel have shown up in Manguso’s first memoir, “The Two Kinds of Decay” (2008), and in her autobiographical book “Ongoingness: The End of a Diary” (2015). The similarities don’t feel hidden or coy. Manguso has spoken of her husband abruptly leaving her, in 2020, and she gives John elements of his background and similar artistic ambitions.

John worries about becoming a footnote in Jane’s biography. “He said he didn’t want to be the unsuccessful partner of the successful person,” she says. “Then he apologized and said that he’d just wanted to be honest. I said, It was brave and considerate to tell me.” Unlike Jamison’s memoir, in which we see a loving relationship turn sour, “Liars” makes the rot in this marriage visible from the beginning. John does not conceal his insecurity or entitlement. Jane, in turn, admits her contempt: “I noticed that he used the word phenomena as a singular noun, couldn’t spell the word necessary, couldn’t write a coherent paragraph. Next to him, I was brilliant. Next to me, he was beautiful, charming, and initially capable of hiding all the things that, in my wrinkly little heart, made me consider him inferior.” His haplessness confounds her. A framed picture falls on the floor one day and shatters. After sweeping up, John jokes, “Being an adult is really annoying.” “Had he never swept a floor?” Jane wonders. “I tucked away the little shard of the day because I couldn’t imagine that it could be true, that he would actually think what he appeared to be thinking.” In “Liars,” Jane empties her pockets and lets fall more than a decade’s worth of painstakingly hoarded splinters and shards. She begins to tally: “By noon I’d showered, dressed, tidied the house of John’s shoes and clothes, put away laundry, swept the floor, watered the garden, moved boxes to the garage, cooked breakfast, eaten, done the dishes, taken out the recycling, handled correspondence, and made the bed. John had gotten up and taken a shit.”

The book is a balance sheet. Jane documents a few serious, even scary episodes. She slaps him; he shoves her. On one occasion, he is found drunk, passed out on a sidewalk; a terrified and heavily pregnant Jane mops up his vomit and tries to sleep on the floor of the emergency room as he is scanned for a brain bleed. The majority of the incidents, however, are what the writer Dawn Powell described as the “pinpricks” of domestic life. John washes most but not all of the dishes. John does the dishes, but he puts the refillable seltzer bottles in the dishwasher and melts them. John forgets to clean the cutting boards. John forgets to buy the muesli. John arrives late to parties and forgets the gifts. John buys another stack of comic books and spends too much money on cheese again. John promises to vacuum but pleads back spasms. John spends forty dollars on sushi. John promises to be home before eleven o’clock to fuck Jane; at eleven o’clock, Jane, alone at home, begins washing the dishes.

Virtuous Jane! Jane spot-cleans, area-cleans, rage-cleans, and nurses the baby seven times. Jane plays Mozart for the child. Jane plays “Rhapsody in Blue” for the child. Jane makes origami polyhedra with the child. Jane kneads two batches of cookie dough—after her hysterectomy! Jane packs and unpacks their belongings, hires and fires babysitters. Jane gets John’s phone turned back on after he forgets to pay his bill. Jane makes herself come, again. Jane roasts carrots. Jane, pointedly, does not include any information that challenges or complicates her version of events.

John’s surname—Bridges—recalls Evan S. Connell’s paired novels, “Mrs. Bridge” (1959) and “Mr. Bridge” (1969), which tell the story of a marriage from the perspective of each half of a deeply repressed Midwestern couple. The books have provided a template of sorts for recent fiction like “Fleishman Is in Trouble” and “Fates and Furies,” in which we get the husband’s and the wife’s interpretations, each of them annotating the other’s story. “Liars,” however, belongs only to Jane. It is her aria—of laundry loads and slights—as she repeats the details of her life back to herself in disbelief: “Every day I had to write it all down again so I could see it all in one place, but it didn’t sink in. I kept having to say the same things over and over.”

Why do you stay? a neighbor asks, listening to her litany. After a screaming fight, after John admits that he cannot contribute to the joint bank account that month, after Jane cries “from the deepest part of the pain tank,” she admits, “I understood why people divorce.” The reader’s heart lifts—see Jane run?—but then drops, realizing that there are more than two hundred pages to go. Eventually, it’s John who will leave, for another woman, and Jane who will beg him to stay.

“Liars” was not a novel Manguso intended to write. She had a contract for a different book, a long-planned study of whiteness and migration to New England, marrying history, sociology, and her own family’s story. She has approached such topics before, in her novel “Very Cold People” (2022), which explores the wages of secrecy around sexual violation in a small Massachusetts town. Writers are often encouraged to find their voices, but it has always been Manguso’s silences that have felt distinctive—she is a sculptor of omission, distinguishing what has not been said from what cannot be said. Negative space is a key feature of her form. In “The Two Kinds of Decay,” she describes undergoing treatment for a rare neurological disease, during which her blood plasma was removed and replaced more than fifty times. “I was brought upstairs from Emergency to Intensive Care and given a treatment called apheresis,” she writes. “From the Greek aphairein, to take away. In the hematological context, apheresis is the process of separating blood into its components (red cells, white cells, platelets, plasma), removing the component that’s sick.” Much of Manguso’s writing pursues a similar effect in its calm, cool fragmentation, which slows down the narration and allows her to carve away as much as she can in order to isolate pure states of being. “Ongoingness” is a distillation of her eight-hundred-thousand-word diary, less interested in preserving a record than in capturing the essence of the desire to preserve. Her collection “300 Arguments” (2017) is even more compressed, comprising mostly aphorisms (“inner beauty can fade, too”), just the lines Manguso imagines being underlined in a much longer book.

“Liars” seems, at first, like a departure from her aloof, even icy work of the past. Here the writing scalds and gives the appearance of holding nothing back. But key omissions are, in fact, central to its architecture. John’s version of events—his intentions and perspective—is entirely absent. Jane does not seem to entertain them, nor does Manguso. There is a strange lack of motive in the book. We receive blurry, shifting notions of why the couple act as they do: why they married, why they hurt each other. Instead, from the opening lines, from the very names—John and Jane—there is a sense of a universal story being unfurled, a fable. “In the beginning I was only myself,” Jane says. “Everything that happened to me, I thought, was mine alone. Then I married a man, as women do. My life became archetypal, a drag show of nuclear familyhood. I got enmeshed in a story that had already been told ten billion times.”

A woman marries, and she steps into—and is effaced by—a story and a script. There are no choices to interrogate, no motive to examine; the why is a given. It is patriarchy. Even Jane’s desire for her husband, the thing that binds her to him, is beyond her volition. It is biology. Her body wants him, despite herself. She is commandeered by her ever-optimistic eggs, her hormones: “I ovulated hard, as I always did then. I ovulated like a mother. Every time John was kind to me, my body immediately responded. It wanted me to get pregnant again.” To ask why she stays, why she suffers, borders on offense. “No married woman I knew was any better off, so I was determined to carry on,” she says. “I was exactly as angry as every other woman I knew. It wasn’t that we’d been born angry; we’d become women and ended up angry. Anger is one of the last privileges of the truly helpless. Infants are angry.”

Manguso presents Jane’s logic not as a curiosity, not as intriguingly unreliable narration, but as primal truth. The book is called “Liars” because both husband and wife are lying; Jane, Manguso suggests, lies to conceal her exploitation and abuse from herself. A reader could be forgiven for thinking that Jane is also lying to herself about her own impulses. When a journalist visits her for an interview, she is strangely compelled to sexually service him. “Even though I wasn’t attracted to him and would have been disgusted if I’d had to kiss him, having an unfamiliar cock in the house made me want to suck and fuck it. I couldn’t tell if the urge was entirely separate from my habit of locating any nearby need for emotional labor and immediately fulfilling it, but it didn’t matter. Either way, when an entire civilization tells you that you owe that cock a good suck and fuck, it isn’t a personal failure when you give in. You’ve been coerced.”

What is this vision of womanhood, of sexually indiscriminate infants running households? For all her subtlety, Manguso has always evinced a tendency to make broad, sometimes crude generalizations, to break the world into types. In “Very Cold People,” characters lose any sense of individuality or inner life after experiencing abuse—they become lumped together as “all the Waitsfield girls,” reduced to the sheer fact of a suffering that seems not merely inevitable but ordained. Such simplification shaded into something uglier in “The Two Kinds of Decay.” Manguso describes one of her doctors bungling a procedure, writing, with rage and disgust, about his clumsiness, his body odor. She never names him, but he provides the chapter heading: “The Sikh.” My breath catches every time I recall it, her easy, unembarrassed way of not only reducing the man to his identity but having his identity announce the chapter, float over it, as if to explain his incompetence, his smell.

Manguso’s secret weapon has always been the sudden, blunt moment of self-implication—her disappointment, for example, in her first memoir, when she realizes that her illness has not made her a better person but, rather, transformed her into a monster of entitlement. That book, however, was written after seven years of remission. “Liars” seems to have been written in the heat of the crisis. “The blood jet” is what Sylvia Plath called her sudden outpouring of poetry after Ted Hughes left her for another woman. But novels require different fuel; among their essential ingredients are doubt and time. This book, in its blazing assurance, tells a thin and partial tale, frayed by silences that feel more like blind spots than like the canny omissions of old. A writer, lancing and fluent on what cannot be said, founders here in her inability to reckon with what she has yet to see.

Signed and sealed, “Liars” is almost impenetrable in its self-conviction—but there is a clue to understanding it, embedded in the acknowledgments. Manguso thanks the cartoonist Tracy Schorn “and the life-saving community of Chump Nation,” an online network of people who follow Schorn’s writing on infidelity. Manguso became a daily visitor to their forums after her husband left her; it was, she said on Schorn’s podcast, her therapy. The group shares a particular vocabulary and framework for understanding infidelity. The betrayed party is “the chump,” the cheater is a “fuckwit,” and the cheating partner is, incredibly, “the schmoopie.” A chump minimizing a fuckwit’s harm is said to be engaged in “spackling.” For the chump to compete with the schmoopie for the fuckwit’s attention is to do the “pick-me dance.” To try to understand the cheater’s motivation is to be entangled in “the skein of crazy.” Chump Nation has a mission to reframe cheating as abuse and to push back against “the reconciliation-industrial complex.” “Lose a cheater, gain a life” is the motto.

These steely certainties, swaddled in baby talk and baby thinking, are the unfortunate scaffolding of “Liars,” which employs language not of harm, hurt, or humiliation but of domestic abuse. “It’s the critical mass of details that makes John’s abuse impossible to deny,” Manguso said on the podcast. “We need to get specific when we talk about covert domestic abuses.” Heterosexual marriage itself is regarded as only questionably consensual. “We are impelled to make this bad choice,” Manguso added. “The entire civilization is screaming it at us . . . from the cradle.”

A little proportion, please. As the product of generations of arranged marriages, a number of them coerced, I find that such claims feel strange, if not obscene. It’s not merely that bandying around these neon words—abuse, coercion—dilutes their power; it’s that these words are being deployed to foreclose thought and impose silences of their own. Chump Nation cautions against posing too many questions about why someone cheats, about marital dynamics or psychology, to avoid revictimizing the chump. The finality of such diagnoses stunts Manguso’s account, keeps it from becoming a more persuasive story, where we would genuinely feel for and trust the protagonist, experience the full measure of her loss and exploitation. There are occasional glimpses of a more complex portrait. (Manguso is too interesting a writer to hew completely to the program.) “Being ignored—was that my trigger?” Jane wonders, considering an old pattern with John. “For rage and, somehow, also, for desire? It turns me on when you ignore me.” Later, when considering her own decisions, her orientation toward freedom or constraint, she admits to herself, “I was a logical person, and I chose restriction, over and over, because it felt good.”

“Is the end of the marriage plot the beginning of a woman’s self-knowledge?” the writer Joanna Biggs, reflecting on her recent book about divorce, “A Life of One’s Own,” asked in the Guardian. It can be, Biggs finds, if an individual can embrace plotlessness for a time, if she is willing to reëxamine her premises and her path, to think. To do so, to try to understand, is not an act of exoneration but an act of attention. And attention, as Manguso noted in her first memoir, is “suffering’s lesson.” “Pay attention,” she wrote. “The important part might come in a form you do not recognize.” Stay alert, stay inquisitive. Don’t just trade one lie for another. Don’t be that chump. ♦","A cartoon image of two women in a domestic setting, one is lifting the other, with a vacuum cleaner, a mug, and a refrigerator in the background.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BC791D840>,2024-08-12 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.newyorker.com,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/08/12/liars-sarah-manguso-book-review,['Opinion/Editorial'],[0.9],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/314f80bc5d.png

Copper spot prices are typically quoted in pounds or kilograms in U.S. dollars. But there are other ways to quote copper spot prices.

Traders refer to the price of physical copper as the spot price. Because these transactions are for immediate delivery, they’re settled on the spot.

Copper spot prices are typically quoted in pounds or kilograms. In domestic markets, they’re quoted in U.S. dollars.

Copper price chart

The following chart is of copper spot prices over the course of the year. This data is accurate as of July 29, 2024. It doesn’t display intraday highs or lows.

Copper reached a 52-week high of $5.18 on May 20, 2024, and a 52-week low of $3.52 on Oct. 20, 2024.

Spot metal prices

Copper is classified as a base metal. This is due to its widespread industrial use and greater abundance than precious metals. But it’s often quoted alongside gold, silver, platinum and palladium, which are precious metals.

Although copper isn’t a precious metal, it’s important. The base metal is used in electrical wiring and construction. It’s also used in new technologies like electric vehicles.

Copper’s spot price depends on several factors. These include mining production, global demand, scrap availability, currency exchange rates and inventory levels.

What influences copper prices?

The following factors affect supply and demand and influence copper’s price:

China’s economic activities. The country is one of the largest copper consumers. Its rapid industrialization and urbanization have increased the demand for copper, as the base metal is used in manufacturing and construction. Fluctuations in China’s economic growth or industrial policies impact global copper demand.

Currency fluctuations. Copper typically trades in U.S. dollars. When the dollar is strong, copper is more expensive in other currencies, potentially reducing demand. When the dollar is weak, copper is cheaper in other currencies, potentially fueling demand.

The clean energy revolution. Copper plays a critical role in the economy’s electrification, including in EVs, renewable energy systems and infrastructure. The move toward cleaner energy sources could increase the demand for copper.

Mining production. Mining disruptions — due to strikes, accidents or environmental factors — can lead to supply constraints and higher prices. Decisions by major copper-producing countries to release or withhold copper from their national reserves can also impact global prices.

History of copper prices

Fluctuations in copper prices have tracked a number of economic and geopolitical events.

Copper prices rose steadily in the early 2000s. China’s rapid industrialization and urbanization drove demand. But volatility followed in the mid-2010s when the country’s economy slowed. This, along with a global surplus, led to price declines.

The COVID-19 pandemic shook things up in 2020. Prices initially dropped as demand decreased and supply chains were disrupted. They rebounded later that year, a rally that carried into 2021.

Since then, green technology has been a major driver of demand. Copper is an important component of electric vehicles and renewable energy systems. As technologies shift away from fossil fuels, copper prices could be driven higher.

What are copper futures?

Like many commodities, copper trading frequently utilizes futures contracts. These are different from spot prices. They secure the right to buy or sell copper at a fixed price on a future date.

CME Group offers copper futures. You might use them to speculate on or hedge against future price movements. The standard contract size is 25,000 pounds, making them a significant tool for large-scale traders and industrial users.

Copper’s product code on the electronic trading platform CME Globex is HG. You can use it to identify and trade copper futures contracts.

The CME Group Volatility Index offers insights into the 30-day implied volatility of the copper market. It reflects expectations of price fluctuations in the market based on trading options for copper futures.

52157c6793,Forbes,5 Must-Have Skills To Remain Employable In 2024 - Forbes,"As we’ve discussed before, no job is truly safe. Whether it’s unstable economic conditions, disruptive technological advancements, or even toxic workplace politics, there’s never a guarantee that you will secure your role forever.

While job cuts are not something you can control as an employee, what you can do is to ensure that your current skills remain relevant and that you’re able to bring value wherever you end up. Here are five skills that will help you get any job in 2024.

Strategic Thinking (What AI Can’t Do)

Artificial intelligence has definitely taken giant strides in the past few years. Generative AI, in particular, can now write, generate images, audio, and even video in a level of sophistication never seen before. What it can’t do, however, is to employ strategic thinking.

Strategic thinking refers to the ability to devise strategic solutions to problems identified after analyzing complex situations and identifying trends in the data. While AI is particularly excellent at analyzing chunks of information and condensing it into neat summaries, it still lacks the human ability to employ the creative and critical thinking skills required to make decisions because it’s not sentient. For now at least, strategic thinking is something only breathing humans like you and I have.

Even better news: strategic thinking skills come with experience and practice. Like any muscle, repeated exercise will help make strategic thinking come easier to you.

So, to get better at strategic thinking, make it a habit to analyze even the simplest problems from multiple angles and come up with multiple potential solutions. It’s also helpful to break down big tasks into manageable chunks, allowing you to tackle them systematically.

Do all of this consistently, and you’ll be able to position yourself as a valuable contributor to any team.

Intentional Communication Skills

The ability to express and articulate ideas clearly in any format will always be an important skill. But with AI’s recent technological leaps, it’s a good idea to go beyond simple expression and move up to intentional communication.

What is intentional communication? A lot of the time, our primary goal is just to express ideas, with no thought of what might happen afterward, at least not consciously. When we do intentional communication, we do so with a clear purpose.

To be clear, I don’t encourage manipulation, which involves withholding or distorting information for your gain. Instead, I encourage the practice of creating a well-thought-out message that considers the needs of your audience, the context of the message, and your desired outcome.

Intentional communication skills are particularly important for employers because they demonstrate someone’s ability to get people to work towards a common goal. Intentional communicators engage in meaningful conversations, ask insightful questions, and express genuine interest in people and the organization, making them excellent leaders and collaborators in the workplace.

Data Skills

With organizations striving to make data-driven decisions, the ability to turn raw data into actionable insights is still a coveted skill set that could land you a role this year. Even more exciting is that data skills are needed in practically every industry.

For example, data experts are particularly in demand in marketing as their skills can help interpret consumer data to tailor campaigns and optimize ad spend. Data skills are useful even in retail, where companies need to know how to manage inventory efficiently and get a pulse on customer trends.

Where there is a need to reduce cost, optimize resources, or streamline operations, the ability to analyze and interpret data will always be helpful. So, if you’re looking to acquire a new skill and have a knack for working with numbers and patterns, data skills should be at the top of your list.

Leadership

When Silicon Valley companies did their massive job cuts starting last year, one of the main reasons was the push for leaner teams. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg famously branded 2023 as their “Year of Efficiency,"" and proceeded to cut more than 10,000 jobs, a third of which were middle managers.

Given that fact, it would be tempting to assume that leadership skills are no longer much of an asset and that you’d be better off as an individual contributor. On the contrary, leadership skills are even more useful in lean teams, where smaller teams are pushed to achieve the same, if not greater, levels of success with a smaller headcount.

Having good leadership skills in leaner organizations means having the ability to motivate team members in the face of tight deadlines and increased responsibilities. Because there are fewer levels of review, managers in this kind of environment also have to be adaptable and strategic in their decision-making process.

It’s also worth noting that just a few months after making the job cuts, Meta is set to “hire strongly” again in 2024, which means that those middle managers were let go primarily because of economic and financial reasons, not because their skills were no longer required.

Sense of Humor

I say people should be proud to be the personality hire in the office. They play a big role in helping their team but also elevating the people and culture around them. The truth is people like working with people they like. And funny people are mostly universally liked. You can be the hardest worker in a room, but if you can’t articulate ideas and don’t work well with others, then you’re less likely to be considered a real asset to the organization.","A person is typing on a laptop with the words 'SKILL TRAINING' displayed on the screen, with a cup of coffee and a notebook beside them.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BCB302BF0>,2024-05-26 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.forbes.com,https://www.forbes.com/sites/shodewan/2024/05/26/5-must-have-skills-to-remain-employable-in-2024/,['Business and Finance' 'Technology' 'Other'],[0.95 0.7  0.5 ],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/52157c6793.png
e078e0b1a6,The New York Times,Election Updates: R.F.K. Jr. challenges Trump to a debate at the Libertarian Party convention. - The New York Times,"“They are upset that you blew up the deficit, shut down their businesses during Covid, and filled your administration with swamp creatures,” he said. “So I’d like to make you an offer,” he said, adding that their campaign schedules made for a logical showdown. “It’s perfect neutral territory for you and me to have a debate where you can defend your record for your wavering supporters.”

A spokesman for the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for the Libertarian Party did not immediately provide a comment.

The party’s convention is set for Memorial Day weekend in Washington. Mr. Kennedy is set to speak on May 24, his campaign said on Tuesday; Mr. Trump is scheduled for May 25. Both candidates are trying to appeal to a broader base of support in the election, but neither is expected to be on the party’s ballot line in November.

Mr. Kennedy previously ruled out running as a Libertarian, though he has courted party members since he became an independent last fall. The party is among the more established third parties, and as of last week was on the ballot in 37 states; Mr. Kennedy is mounting a state-by-state effort to get on the November election ballot.

As for Mr. Trump, Angela McArdle, the chairwoman of the Libertarian party, said last week that it was “not possible” under the party’s bylaws to nominate him.

Several candidates seeking the Libertarian Party’s presidential nomination have condemned the group’s decision to invite Mr. Trump to speak at the gathering. One of them, Jacob Hornberger, called it an “abomination.”

The gamesmanship by Mr. Kennedy, a liberal scion and environmental lawyer who has recently become better known for his anti-vaccine activism and promotion of conspiracy theories, appears to have added to growing hostilities between him and Mr. Trump.

The former president has sharpened his attacks on Mr. Kennedy as more polls show signs that his candidacy could take votes away from Mr. Trump. For many months, Democrats had argued the opposite: that Mr. Kennedy could wind up playing the role of spoiler for Mr. Biden.

Last week, Mr. Kennedy proposed that his campaign and Mr. Biden’s jointly conduct a poll in October to see who would do better against Mr. Trump in a hypothetical two-way race; he suggested that the underperformer should drop out.

Instead of talking up her conservative bona fides, however, Ms. Noem has spent the last week on national television defending a grisly account in the book in which she shoots her dog in a gravel pit. The killing of the dog, a 14-month-old wire-haired pointer named Cricket, has drawn bipartisan criticism and scrutiny.

The book, published on Tuesday, includes a number of other noteworthy details, some of which Ms. Noem has discussed in recent interviews. Here are five takeaways.

Noem has a lot of criticism for other Republicans.

Ms. Noem’s account of her time in office — first as South Dakota’s sole House representative and then as governor — includes many stories that broadly criticize Republicans for their electoral failures, while also targeting figures who have drawn the ire of Mr. Trump.

She describes a phone conversation she had with Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who dropped out of the Republican presidential primary race in March, claiming that Ms. Haley had threatened her because they were both prominent Republican women. Chaney Denton, a spokeswoman for Ms. Haley, has said Ms. Noem’s account of the conversation was inaccurate, and “just plain weird.”

Ms. Noem also blames Ronna McDaniel, the former chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, for the poor performance of Republican candidates in the 2022 midterms, and criticizes her for not supporting Mr. Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen — though Ms. Noem herself writes in that section that “Trump lost in 2020.”

“We got lazy, and no one was held accountable,” she says, adding that Mr. Trump was wrongly blamed for Republicans’ underperforming. She also called out the National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm of House Republicans, though she says she has hope for 2024 and is “willing to help.”

Ms. Noem devotes a section of the book to RINOs — Republicans in Name Only — a favorite pejorative of Mr. Trump that he has deployed against critics within the party.

“In many ways, these political creatures are worse than some donkeys,” Ms. Noem wrote, referring to Democrats in that section as “donkeys.”

But Ms. Noem also takes a swipe at some Republicans on the far right in her party, saying that they have contributed to recent election losses.

“Losing sucks. But Republicans happen to be great at it,” she writes in one section, adding: “Candidates talk like crazy people, make wild claims, and offer big promises. And they lose. Of course, there are some crazy candidates, but I’m not talking about them. This is about good folks who choose the wide path of bomb throwing and parroting whatever’s on social media, as opposed to speaking rationally and humbly offering solutions.”

Noem says shooting her dog was a “difficult” choice, and suggests one of President Biden’s dogs should be put down, too.

Ms. Noem has repeatedly defended her decision to kill her dog, Cricket, and her politically baffling choice to include the anecdote in her memoir.

In the book, she describes an incident where Cricket killed a neighbor’s chickens and says the dog tried to bite Ms. Noem as she sought to restrain her. After taking Cricket home and shooting her, Ms. Noem writes, “I realized another unpleasant job needed to be done. Walking back up to the yard, I spotted our billy goat.”

The goat, Ms. Noem writes, “was nasty and mean,” smelled terrible and often chased her children around. So she dragged him out to the gravel pit, too — but didn’t kill him with the first shot, and had to go back to her truck for more ammunition to finish the job.

In an interview with Sean Hannity last week, Ms. Noem said she had included the story in the book to illustrate the “tough, challenging decisions that I’ve had to make throughout my life.”

In an interview on “Face the Nation” on CBS on Sunday, Ms. Noem called attention to another part of the book in which she suggested that one of President Biden’s dogs, a bite-prone German shepherd named Commander, should also be put down.

In a section of the memoir discussing what Ms. Noem would do on her first day in office as president, she wrote that “the first thing I’d do is make sure Joe Biden’s dog was nowhere on the grounds (‘Commander, say hello to Cricket for me’).” Ms. Noem made a similar suggestion in her interview on Sunday.

“You’re saying he should be shot?” asked the CBS host Margaret Brennan.

“That what’s the president should be accountable to,” Ms. Noem replied.

The print edition of the book includes a false anecdote about Noem meeting Kim Jong-un.

Ms. Noem writes in the memoir that she met with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean dictator, while serving on the House Armed Services Committee.

“I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders — some who wanted our help, and some who didn’t,” she writes. “I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. I’m sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I’d been a children’s pastor, after all). Dealing with foreign leaders takes resolve, preparation, and determination.”

This was an error, according to Ian Fury, the chief of communications for Ms. Noem. Ms. Noem has said in later interviews that she takes “responsibility for the change,” but has not explained why the anecdote was included or whom she could have been referring to, if not Mr. Kim. She has also pushed back when the false anecdote has been characterized as a mistake.

“This is an anecdote that I asked to have removed, because I think it’s appropriate at this point in time,” Ms. Noem said in her interview on “Face the Nation.” “But I’m not going to talk to you about those personal meetings that I have had with world leaders.”

Noem gives a glowing portrait of Trump, and alludes to her future aspirations.

Ms. Noem heaps praise on the former president in her memoir, describing him as “a breaker and a builder,” writing, “He was relentlessly attacked for personal failures — and fictional ones — but stayed in the race and never wavered.”

She also reminds readers that she defended Mr. Trump in a speech the day after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, “regardless of the fact that what unfolded on January 6 was undeniably ugly.”

At one point, she also says that Mr. Trump, “in some funny ways,” is similar to her young granddaughter.

“I see similarities between Trump and my granddaughter, Miss Addie (that’s what I call her),” Ms. Noem writes. “She’s almost three years old and, in my unbiased view, one of the most brilliant human beings I’ve ever met (tied for first place with my grandson, of course!)”

But while Ms. Noem may be angling for a place at Mr. Trump’s side as his running mate, she insists in the memoir that if she is picked, it should not be because she’s a woman.

“I’m often asked by the national media if I think Donald Trump should pick a woman to be vice president,” Ms. Noem writes. “My answer is always about choosing the best people for the job.”

The final chapter of the book focuses not on any vice-presidential aspirations, but rather on what she would do on “Day 1” if elected president herself. It begins with a quote from Mr. Trump saying in December that if elected as president, he wouldn’t be a dictator, “except for Day 1.”

Along with putting federal property up for sale and convening a bipartisan working group on immigration, Ms. Noem writes, she would invite the Obamas and Bidens over to the White House for a screening of “The Grey,” a Liam Neeson film about battling wolves that she describes earlier in the book as among her favorites.

Noem offers a somewhat exaggerated account of protests outside the White House in 2020.

In the book’s introduction, Ms. Noem writes that a chaotic protest outside Mr. Trump’s 2020 nomination for re-election, held at the White House in August, was a pivotal moment for her — and inspired her to “live a life of significance — no matter where that commitment took me.” She wrote of a Washington under siege.

“We could hear explosions and screams in the distance,” she wrote. “On the other side of the fence, sounds of shouting and chaos. I smelled what we guessed was tear gas. We were trapped.”

But her account of a “massive and, at times, violent protest” doesn’t align with contemporaneous reports.

There was a significant demonstration outside the White House during Mr. Trump’s renominating event — one that tried to disrupt his acceptance speech by making noise. Reports from the time described the demonstration as “generally peaceful” and “significantly smaller” than the demonstrations that were forcibly dispersed by Mr. Trump earlier in the spring. There is also no evidence that tear gas was deployed that night.

And while young voters are cooler to Mr. Biden than they were at the same point in 2020, there is little evidence that American support for the Israeli invasion of Gaza is a critical factor in their relative discontent.

“When you have two presidents that have the same stance on one issue, that automatically puts that issue — I hate to say lower down the list, because it’s obviously an important issue, but it doesn’t make it an issue where I’m going to choose Donald Trump over Joe Biden,” said Devon Schwartz, a student at the University of Texas at Austin.

A student of both Muslim and Jewish descent who is active in a campus group promoting interfaith dialogue, Mr. Schwartz, 19, thought the protests at his college, which have drawn police crackdowns, were “a historic moment.” And he said he would have liked the opportunity to vote for a candidate who is “more progressive on Israel” than Mr. Biden in November. But he plans to vote for him anyway.

“I want to see policy changes from Joe Biden,” he said. “I don’t want to vote for Donald Trump and then just see the same exact policies.”

American sympathies in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have shifted modestly toward Palestinians over the past decade. Although 51 percent of Americans remain more sympathetic toward Israelis, 27 percent now sympathize more with the Palestinian people, up from 12 percent in 2013, according to Gallup.

The shift is substantially generational, most likely reflecting not only changes in the conflict itself, and a rightward turn in Israeli politics, but also a decade in which pro-Palestinian activists have worked to connect the cause to domestic movements in the United States like Black Lives Matter and campaigns to divest from Israel have gained ground on college campuses.

The latest polling from the Pew Research Center finds 18-to-29-year olds three times more likely to sympathize with Palestinians in the conflict than those over 65, and twice as likely as adults as a whole.

“Not necessarily everyone is as fired up about it as we see from those out protesting,” said Laura Silver, the associate director of global research for Pew. “But 18-to-29-year-olds are far and away different from older Americans.”

Recent polls suggest these sympathies have yet to translate into prioritizing the war as a voting issue in 2024.

In the Harvard Institute of Politics’ Youth Poll conducted shortly before the past month’s wave of campus demonstrations and crackdowns, 18-to-29-year-old Americans overwhelmingly faulted Mr. Biden for his handling of the conflict in Gaza, with 76 percent disapproving and 18 percent approving. But only 2 percent of them rated it their top concern in the election, compared with 27 percent who said they were most concerned about economic issues.

In an Economist/YouGov poll taken more recently, in late April, 22 percent of voters aged 18 to 29 listed inflation as their most important issue. Two percent named foreign policy as their top concern. (The poll did not specifically ask about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.)

“My friends and I, we all are very concerned about the war in the Middle East, and we disagree with the Biden administration’s agenda there,” said Coral Lin, 20, a student at Duke University. She said she had one friend who had voted “uncommitted” in a Democratic primary in protest over the issue.

“But I still know a lot of people who hold that view and still are voting for Biden,” she said, noting that her own concerns about the climate and her belief that Mr. Trump poses a threat to democracy have led her to continue to support Mr. Biden.

Clara Getty, 21, a student at the University of Virginia and a Biden supporter, said she saw parallels with Lyndon B. Johnson’s woes in the 1968 Democratic primary while facing outrage over the Vietnam War — and a cautionary tale. “He made so much progress on domestic issues that I think could’ve greatly benefited from a second term,” she said. “And I think so much is similar for Biden.”

Others argued, however, that even if the Gaza conflict didn’t lead to a mass exodus of young voters to Mr. Trump, it could pose problems for Mr. Biden if young people don’t vote.

“You hear from a lot of people who are just increasingly apathetic about voting for Joe Biden,” said Cameron Driggers, a 19-year-old University of Florida student and member of the youth council of the state Democratic Party.

An Israel divestment campaign organizer on his campus, Mr. Driggers noted that Mr. Biden would need not just votes but youth organizers to win in 2024, including many who had become active in the protest politics around Gaza.

“He continues to basically spit in the face of youth organizers around the country,” he said. “He’s especially enraging the people who turn out votes.”

In a statement, Mia Ehrenberg, a Biden campaign spokeswoman, pointed to the campaign’s investments in its own campus organizers and youth groups, and its intention to “continue to show up and communicate with young voters on the issues they care about,” including climate change, gun laws and student loans.

The Biden administration has recently announced more changes to student loan repayments and Mr. Biden directed his administration to consider reclassifying marijuana as a less serious drug. His campaign promoted his stance on X at exactly 4:20 p.m. on April 20.

Mr. Driggers said he had broadly supported Mr. Biden before the Gaza invasion, citing his steps liberalizing marijuana policies, support for labor rights, and withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. But his support had been tested by Gaza.

“I do recognize that Trump is almost certainly going to be worse than Biden on all of these issues,” he said. “But at a certain point, you know, there has to be a line” for Biden. “And I believe he’s close to crossing that.”","An older man with grey hair, wearing a dark suit and tie, gesturing with his right hand, stands in front of an American flag.

4664910e56,Financial Times,Joe Biden fights for his political future - Financial Times,"Good morning and welcome to US Election Countdown — it’s great to be back with you after the long weekend! Today, let’s talk about:

Biden’s counterattack

The Trump family’s Middle East aspirations

How to lose an election in two hours

Joe Biden is trying desperately to salvage his campaign. And make no mistake — this week is critical for his political future.

The president kicked off a combative new offensive to hold on to his candidacy yesterday as he attacked his Democratic critics, vowed to stay in the 2024 race and called for renewed party unity [free to read].

Biden stressed in a letter to congressional Democrats that he’s committed to “running this race to the end”, warning that “any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps [Donald] Trump and hurts us”.

There’s no way around it: his hold on the Democratic leadership is still slipping after his recent media appearances assuaged no one. The party is divided between those who’ve called for him to drop out, those who’ve promised to stand by him and those who haven’t said either way.

As the counterattack began and lawmakers were back on Capitol Hill following the holiday weekend, one Democratic powerbroker suggested that we may be approaching the end of Biden’s candidacy:

Unless there are data that show our chances of success in the House and Senate haemorrhaging, I think it would be very hard to move the President and his family off of where they are.

But I think that we will see that.

For his part, the president is fed up with his debate performance dominating the conversation, even though he’s failed to quell the party and donor rebellion that has formed in its wake.

“The question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now,” Biden wrote. “And it’s time for it to end.”

He’s “getting so frustrated by the elites” in the party who want him out, and even dared them to put forth another candidate: “Run against me. Go ahead. Announce for president. Challenge me at the convention,” Biden told MSNBC, the cable television network watched by many Democrats.

But every move he makes will be scrutinised like never before — especially his expected press conference during this week’s Nato summit in Washington, where he will be unscripted.

Behind the scenes

The Trumps want to do more business in the Middle East, reviving concerns about potential conflicts of interest should the family patriarch make it back to the White House.

The Trump Organization, founded by the ex-president and run by his sons Donald Jr and Eric, has struck deals with Dar Global — a London-listed Saudi Arabian real estate group — for a luxury resort in Oman and a Trump Tower in Jeddah.

Eric Trump told the FT’s Chloe Cornish that:

We will definitely be doing other projects in this region . . . This region has explosive growth, and that’s not stopping anytime soon.

Trump already has a golf course in ritzy Dubai with local developer Damac.

Along with these projects, Jared Kushner, the candidate’s son-in-law, has a hedge fund that has raised $2bn from Riyadh, leading critics to say that a re-elected Trump could be susceptible to foreign influence.

Eric Trump also argued that the family company was undamaged by the civil and criminal cases against his father in the US, and that lenders Deutsche Bank and Axos had stood by the company.

The younger Trump claimed:

We’re sitting on virtually no debt . . . I paid off somewhere in the magnitude of 400 million bucks worth of debt over the last couple years, built an absolute war chest of cash.

Datapoints

Polling since the debate has shown a steep drop in support for Biden. His rival is now ahead of him in every swing state — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — according to averages from FiveThirtyEight.

Trump’s national polling lead has also grown.

On June 27, the night of the debate, Trump was polling at 41.1 per cent to Biden’s 40.9. By July 6, Trump was up to 42.2 per cent, while his successor fell to 39.6 per cent.

The White House has blamed Biden’s abysmal debate performance on a cold and exhaustion from a gruelling international travel schedule in the weeks before the face-off.

He’s since appeared stronger and more with it in campaign stops in North Carolina and Wisconsin — but those events featured a teleprompter. Instead, supporters want him to prove himself without teleprompters as a crutch.

Trump’s campaign staff and surrogates will be licking their lips, hungrily waiting to pounce on any Biden flub this week that can be clipped into a viral video about his age.

2e7ffe6415,The Guardian,European People’s party declines to sign letter condemning far-right political violence - The Guardian,"A row has broken out among political parties in Europe after the centre right group to which Ursula von der Leyen belongs refused to sign a letter condemning the far right and a spate of attacks on politicians in Germany, Belgium, Spain, Sweden and Ireland.

The open letter calls on von der Leyen to “reject any normalisation, cooperation or alliance with the far right and radical parties” and denounces a physical assault on the German centre-left politician Matthias Ecke. Ecke was “seriously injured” after allegedly being attacked by four young men while putting up campaign posters.

The letter has been signed by five of the main political parties in the European parliament, including the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, Renew, representing the liberals, the Greens and the Left.

But the European People’s party (EPP), the largest group in the parliament representing conservative-leaning parties throughout Europe, declined.

The French MEP Valérie Hayer, the head of Renew, said her group, which is backed by Emmanuel Macron, regretted that the EPP had not signed. She said: “This puts their commitment to the common fight against destructive, far-right forces into question. We urge the EPP to reconsider and to join this pro-European commitment.”

Tensions have been building since a leaders’ debate in April over which alliances the mainstream parties are prepared to form after the European elections in June. Von der Leyen, who is running for a second term as president of the European Commission, was guarded at the debate about closing down alliances with the rightwing ECR group, which includes the party of the Italian prime minister, Georgia Meloni, as well as extreme right parties such as Éric Zemmour’s Reconquête in France, Spain’s Vox and the Sweden Democrats.

At the time, Von der Leyen criticised the far-right Identity and Democracy group which unites France’s National Rally, Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) and the Danish People’s party, condemning them as “Russian proxies”, but her more equivocal position on the ECR group drew fire from critics.

The EPP reacted furiously to the open letter row, saying the political parties that had signed were playing a “nasty” game, and suggestions that von der Leyen would work with the far right were “bullshit” and “fake news”.

Von der Leyen had frequently ruled out working with the far right, the EPP added.

On Wednesday, von der Leyen restated her intention not to work with the far right. In a speech in Germany, she said she would only work with parties that had “a clear commitment to the rule of law, a clear commitment to Ukraine and against the crimes of the Kremlin, and a clear commitment to our Europe.

She said: “With the servants of the Kremlin, despisers of democracy and extremists, there is no state and no European Union either.”

Sources said the EPP had balked at the use of the term “far right” in the letter. It is understood the EPP had wanted the letter to condemn the “far left” and to add a paragraph restating that the group of parties would only, as the EPP has declared, work with parties that are pro-Ukraine, pro-Nato and pro-rule of law.

The signatories of the letter wrote: “Once more the far right is attempting to bring back the darkest pages of our history, challenging everything we built and poisoning our democracies.”

They went on to “strongly condemn the constantly growing [number of] cases of harassment, vandalism, spread of disinformation, defamation and hate speech by far right parties” across all member states.

The EPP leader in the European parliament, the MEP Manfred Weber, said: “Our principles are clear: we only cooperate with parties that are pro-European, pro-Ukrainian and pro-rule of law.”

Attacks on politicians on social media are now commonplace across Europe but there is mounting concern over physical assaults and harassment at their private homes.

The motive for the attack on Ecke on Friday remains unclear. None of the teenagers has so far spoken, according to police, who have said they are being investigated for grievous bodily harm. But Nancy Faeser, the federal interior minister, has blamed the far right for stoking a climate of violence with hate-filled rhetoric, including on social media.","A woman in a pink blazer stands at a podium with a microphone, gesturing with her right hand.

82347da765,The Globe and Mail,U.S. House Oversight panel subpoenas Secret Service director to testify on Trump assassination attempt - The Globe and Mail,"The Republican chairman of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee issued a subpoena Wednesday to Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle compelling her to appear before the committee on Monday for what is scheduled to be the first congressional hearing into the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump.

Rep. James Comer said initially that the Secret Service committed to her attendance but that Homeland Security officials appear to have intervened and there has been no “meaningful updates or information” shared with the committee.

Comer said the “lack of transparency and failure to cooperate” with the committee called into question Cheatle’s ability to lead the Secret Service and necessitates the subpoena.

Cheatle has said the agency understands the importance of a review ordered by Democratic President Joe Biden and would fully participate in it as well as with congressional committees looking into the shooting.

“The assassination attempt of the former President and current Republican nominee for president represents a total failure of the agency’s core mission and demands Congressional oversight,” Comer wrote in a letter to Cheatle.

The subpoena was just one of a series of developments that occurred Wednesday in the wake of the Saturday assassination attempt.

The fact that a shooter was able to get so close to the former president while he’s supposed to be closely guarded has raised questions about what security plans the agency tasked with taking a bullet for its protectees put in place and who is ultimately responsible for allowing the 20-year-old gunman to climb a roof where he had a clear line of sight to a former president.

Earlier, House Speaker Mike Johnson announced he would be setting up a task force to investigate security failures that occurred during the assassination attempt. He also said he would be calling on Cheatle to resign from her post as director of the Secret Service, saying on Fox News Channel without elaborating, “I think she’s shown what her priorities are.”

He said the task force would be made up of Republicans and Democrats and its formation would speed up the investigative process.

“There’s not a lot of the procedural hurdles, and we’ll have subpoena authority for that task force as well,” Johnson said.

Johnson said he has not received satisfactory answers from Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas or leaders at the FBI.

“We must have accountability for this. It was inexcusable,” Johnson said. “Obviously, there were security lapses. You don’t have to be a special ops expert to understand that. And we’re going to get down to the bottom of it quickly.”

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment on the subpoena.

Cheatle said during an interview Monday with ABC News that the shooting should never have happened, but also said she has no plans to resign.

When asked who beares the most responsibility for the shooting happening, she said: “What I would say is the Secret Service is responsible for the protection of the former president.”

“The buck stops with me. I am the director of the Secret Service,” she said.

So far, she has the support of the administration.

“I have 100% confidence in the director of the United States Secret Service. I have 100% confidence in the United States Secret Service,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Monday.

But in addition to the Congressional inquiries, Cheatle and the Secret Service are also facing an inquiry by the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general.

In a brief notice posted to the inspector general’s website, the agency said the objective of the probe is to “Evaluate the United States Secret Service’s (Secret Service) process for securing former President Trump’s July 13, 2024 campaign event.”

There was no date given for when the investigation was launched. The notice was among a long list of ongoing cases that the inspector general’s office is pursuing.

Biden on Sunday said he was ordering an independent review of the security at the rally. No one has yet been named to lead that inquiry.

Since the shooting, Cheatle and the Security Service have come under intense scrutiny over how a gunman could get in position to fire at a former president.

The shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was able to get within 135 meters (157 yards) of the stage where the Republican former president was speaking when he opened fire. That’s despite a threat on Trump’s life from Iran leading to additional security for the former president in the days before the Saturday rally.

A bloodied Trump was quickly escorted off the stage by Secret Service agents, and agency snipers killed the shooter. Trump said the upper part of his right ear was pierced in the shooting. One rallygoer was killed, and two others critically wounded.

Cheatle said her agency was working to understand how Saturday’s shooting happened and to make sure something like it never does again.

The agency of roughly 7,800 staff members is responsible for protecting presidents, vice presidents, their families, former presidents, their spouses and their minor children under the age of 16 and a few other high-level Cabinet officials such as the Homeland Security secretary.","A person is raising their fist in front of an American flag, with another person in the background, possibly speaking into a microphone.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6B7F034550>,2024-07-17 13:11:23.420000+00:00,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-homeland-security-inspector-general-investigates-secret-service/,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/82347da765.png
b836012825,Financial Times,Clash of the new Republican visions for America’s global role - Financial Times,"The writer directs the Center on the US and Europe at the Brookings Institution

Sweltering heat notwithstanding, Nato’s 75th anniversary summit in Washington went off with no disasters and some moderate successes. Ukraine got no closer to joining, but was told its entry path was “irreversible”; it did get €40bn and badly needed fighter jets and anti-aircraft systems. Two-thirds of Nato’s states are now spending 2 per cent or more of gross domestic product on defence. Nato called China a “decisive enabler” of Russia’s war. Above all, President Joe Biden, 81, presided over this secular high mass of transatlanticism in a strong, unfaltering voice.

At an accompanying conference, administration officials, European leaders and non-MAGA Republican senators intoned messages of resolve. Asked about support for Ukraine after the US election, Idaho’s Jim Risch, senior Republican on the Senate foreign relations committee, remarked soothingly: “America generally does the right thing.”

But does it? Outside the air-conditioned Nato bubble, the US capital is consumed by an overpowering sense of constitutional crisis. A growing chorus of Democrats is voicing fear and rage at Biden’s insistence that his disastrous debate performance last month is immaterial to his fitness to serve a second term. His confusion of Putin and Zelenskyy’s names at his press conference on Thursday evening only amplified the calls.

The GOP’s Make America Great Again camp, meanwhile, appears gleefully certain of victory in November — and aware of the need to look prepared. Washington’s summit week saw several efforts at conservative counter-programming. The goal: to stake out ownership of the murky terrain of MAGA foreign policy, to discipline a churning hard-right movement and project coherence (hello, swing voters), to normalise its foreign policy proposals, to cordon them off from the movement’s more disruptive domestic policy ideas — and, most daringly, to attempt to contain Donald Trump, the party’s mercurial candidate.

On Monday, House Speaker Mike Johnson laid out his views at the conservative Hudson Institute. Mellifluously, he executed a series of pirouettes that positioned him on both sides of his party’s divides: Reagan-style internationalist and America Firster; a firm Nato supporter who sees China as the main long-term challenge; hard-nosed realist and scripture-quoting Baptist.

That day, his party issued a platform resembling a 5,400-word social media post from Trump himself: idiosyncratically capitalised, vague on content and promising to “PREVENT WORLD WAR THREE, RESTORE PEACE IN EUROPE AND IN THE MIDDLE EAST”. Like practically every other recent Republican foreign policy uttering, it invoked Ronald Reagan’s mantra of “peace through strength”.

Yet this MAGA vision has little in common with the 40th president’s belief in America as a shining city upon a hill, or his trust in alliances, markets and civil society. This was in evidence when Republican senator Josh Hawley of Missouri spoke at the opening dinner of a conference of the NatCons, or National Conservatives, who dream of establishing themselves as the west’s dominant rightwing movement.

Hawley called himself a “Christian nationalist” and compared today’s America to the year 410, when imperial Rome fell to the Visigoths. It was left — in his telling — to the Christians to lead the west through the Dark Ages. (For the declining empire, read “establishment Republicans”, and for the invading barbarians the “woke left”.) But the senator knew his audience. He also warned of conservatives hankering after “an established church, ethnonationalism, a ‘protestant Franco’”.

Some NatCon speakers such as Elbridge Colby, an evangelist for prioritising China, and Sumantra Maitra, who has advocated that Washington “pivot away” from the European alliance, stressed they did not want to see the US leave Nato. (Trump, meanwhile, posted that Europeans owed “at least 100 Billion” to “EQUALISE” US support for Ukraine.)

But in an assembly that was notably pale and male, the collective focus was not on foreign policy, or for that matter on moderation. In a shrill mixture of venom and victim-playing, movement leaders instead inveighed on behalf of those “demonised” by “the regime” — “1. Whites 2. Men 3. Christians,” according to one speaker.

Ohio senator JD Vance, a leading hopeful for the about to be named vice-presidential pick, closed the conference by criticising US support of Ukraine and decrying immigration as the greatest danger to national security. The NatCon movement was winning, he said, and Trump would be its president.","A man in a suit stands at a podium with a microphone, gesturing with his right hand, in front of a backdrop with the 'People's Choice' logo.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA1ED48B0>,2024-07-12 16:00:48.686000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/c45c906a-b5a1-467d-a73a-22dd9977815c,['Politics' 'International'],[0.9 0.9],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/b836012825.png
0f32841117,Financial Times,"University students in England face ‘cost of learning crisis’, data suggests - Financial Times","University students in England are facing a “cost of learning crisis”, with the share of their living expenses covered by government maintenance support sinking to its lowest level for at least a decade, according to think-tank research.

Undergraduates receiving the maximum loan entitlement this year will confront a shortfall of £8,400 to meet the “minimum income standard” needed “to have the opportunities and choices necessary to participate in society”, said the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi).

The gap has grown rapidly in recent years as inflation has eroded the value of the maintenance loan, a form of means-tested support available to students to help their living expenses.

In 2010, maintenance support covered almost 74 per cent of the minimum income standard outside London. In 2024-25, the figure fell to 55 per cent of the standard — worth £18,632 a year — assuming the same student spending patterns.

The maximum maintenance support covers 61 per cent of the minimum income standard for students studying in London, calculated at £21,774 a year.

The research by Hepi, published on Thursday, warned that increasing financial pressures were affecting the studies of poorer students, while middle-income families were expected to provide an ever greater share of student support.

The maximum maintenance support available to undergraduates studying outside London in 2024-25 was £10,227, in real terms the lowest level since 2015-16.

Vivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK, which represents more than 170 institutions, said the failure of the government support to keep pace with inflation had left students on average £1,903 worse off, in real terms, than four years ago.

UK consumer price inflation peaked at a 42-year high of 11.1 per cent in October 2022. In March of this year the figure stood at 3.2 per cent.

“It is imperative we look again at how well the current system is supporting students and what changes need to be made to continue widening participation in higher education for all learners, regardless of their background,” she added.

The minimum income standard for undergraduates in England, devised by researchers at Loughborough University and based on a survey of second- and third-year students, worked out at £366 a week.

The calculation drew on an assumed weekly basket of goods and services, including £88 for food, £6 for alcohol, £30 for travel costs, £55 for social activities and £122 for rent.

University leaders have warned for several years that financial pressures are becoming unsustainable for many students.

Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the Russell Group of research universities, said that despite universities spending “tens of millions” on undergraduate support annually, the government need to contribute more.

“Given the parental earnings thresholds for maintenance loans have been frozen since 2008, this will have a bigger impact on lower-income households,” he said.

The Department for Education said the finance system targeted the highest levels of support at lowest-income families, including a 2.5 per cent increase in loans and grants for 2024-25.

It has also added £5mn to the £286mn student premium fund that universities can use to top up hardship grants.

“We are increasing loans and grants for living and other costs, along with freezing tuition fees for the seventh year running to reduce the amount of debt students will take on,” a spokesperson added.

The Hepi report found that without parental support, a student would need to work 19 hours a week at the minimum wage of £8.60 an hour to reach the basic standard — more than the 15 hours that most universities estimate will not harm studies.

Rachel Hewitt, head of MillionPlus, which represents a group of former vocational colleges and polytechnics that became universities in 1992, said that without changes, access to higher education would start to slide backwards.

“Unless action is taken, and soon, it risks reversing any progress seen in higher education to drive social mobility and widen opportunities for all,” she added.

What To Expect From an Online Radiology Tech Program

An online radiology tech program is often a bachelor’s completion program, serving students who are already registered with the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT). As such, these degrees typically do not include hands-on experience or courses in basic radiography procedures, as students are expected to have completed these requirements through prior education in the field.

An online radiology tech bachelor’s degree completion program is often accelerated, allowing students to graduate more quickly than the typical four-year timeline. Entry-level rad tech degrees that cater to students without professional experience are typically offered on campus due to in-person lab and clinical requirements.

Admission Requirements

Typical admission requirements for a rad tech program include the following:

High school transcripts

College transcripts (if applicable)

Proof of American Registry of Radiologic Technologists registry

Essays and personal statements

Letters of recommendation from former teachers or professors

Common Courses

Since rad tech bachelor’s degree completion programs assume prior knowledge and experience in the field, coursework is often advanced and specialized. Below are a few examples of courses you may encounter.

Radiologic Operations: This course focuses on how radiology departments function in various healthcare facilities. Possible topics include procedures, budgeting, supervision and administration.

Advanced Imaging: This course covers advanced diagnostic imaging techniques in the field. Topics may include MRI and ultrasounds, digital fluoroscopy and digital image manipulation.

Vascular/Interventional Procedures: Interventional radiologists use fluoroscopic equipment to guide medical teams during minimally invasive vascular procedures. Possible topics and procedures in this course may include embolization and angiography.

Research Methods and Information Literacy: In this course, students learn about scholarly research methods and resources specific to the medical imaging field.

What Can You Do With an Online Bachelor’s in Radiologic Technology?

Most students who graduate from online rad tech programs work as professional radiologic technologists. Possible workplaces include the following:

Hospitals

Medical centers

Clinics

Outpatient centers

Private practice physician offices

Most rad techs hold an associate degree and ARRT registration as opposed to a four-year degree. One of the main advantages of a bachelor’s degree in the field is that it typically covers more advanced and specialized diagnostic medical imaging techniques.

As such, a bachelor’s degree in the field may help you increase your earning potential, advance to a managerial role, or specialize in a specific radiology subfield, such as interventional radiology, computed tomography or MRIs.

Salary Outlook for Online Bachelor’s in Radiologic Technology Grads

Rad techs typically earn higher-than-average salaries. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, radiologic and MRI technologists earned a median annual salary of $76,020 as of 2023—nearly $30,000 higher than the median annual wage for all occupations ($48,060).

How To Find the Right Online Radiology Tech Program for You

Consider Your Future Goals

If you enroll in a radiology tech program, make sure you want to pursue a career in diagnostic imagery. Because these degrees are highly specialized, they only qualify graduates for a specific set of jobs in the medical field.

However, if you are certain you want to—or already do—work as a radiologic or MRI technologist, an online radiology tech program can help you achieve your professional goals. A bachelor’s program can prepare you to earn the credentials you need to advance into supervisory and leadership positions in radiology.

Keep in mind the only bachelor’s program in radiologic technology that qualified for our ranking requires you to be registered with the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT), meaning you must already work in the field. Delivering radiology tech programs online presents a problem for schools because of the heavy hands-on requirements to learn this profession, so it’s not feasible for this type of program to cater to total beginners.

If you have no experience or relevant prior education, an on-campus associate or bachelor’s degree in this field may be the best radiology tech program option for you.

Understand Your Expenses and Financing Options

ULM charges a per-credit tuition rate of $400 for its radiology tech online program. The degree requires 82 credits after the 38-credit award for ARRT registration, equating to a total tuition cost of approximately $32,800.

According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the average annual tuition at a four-year college was $17,709 in the 2022–2023 school year. Since most bachelor’s degree students take 30 credits per year, the average cost per credit of tuition nationwide is around $590—more expensive than ULM.

You can also pursue financial aid opportunities through your school and third-party scholarship providers, including radiology-related nonprofit organizations.

Should You Enroll in a Radiology Tech Online Program?

Enrolling in an online program in any field, including radiologic technology, may suit some students better than others. To determine if online learning is the right fit, ask yourself the following questions:

What are your other commitments? Online learning can benefit students who work full time or have caregiving responsibilities, as the additional flexibility of asynchronous coursework is more conducive to balancing multiple commitments.

What’s your budget? Per NCES data, tuition rates for ULM’s online radiology tech program are lower than the average cost of tuition nationwide, and the school does not charge out-of-state tuition for distance learners. Additionally, online students save on costs associated with relocation and commuting, making the degree more affordable than similar on-campus programs.

What’s your learning style? Online learning requires a great deal of organization, self-discipline and time management. If you thrive in more structured environments or prefer more frequent interaction with instructors and peers, on-campus learning may better suit your needs.

Accreditation for Online Radiology Programs

There are two types of accreditation: institutional and programmatic.

The U.S. Department of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) oversee the accrediting agencies that manage and administer the institutional accreditation process. These agencies send representatives to evaluate schools for the quality of their programs, finances and faculty, among other areas.

To check a school’s accreditation status, you can use CHEA’s searchable directory or visit the school’s website.

Programmatic accreditation provides similar quality assurance in specific fields and departments. There is no programmatic accreditation agency for radiology, but ARRT maintains a list of recognized educational programs on its website.

4df4674b2b,The Guardian,‘A massive relief and a change of mood’: how did Keir Starmer’s first week in power go? - The Guardian,"When the new British prime minister, Keir Starmer, invited Wes Streeting into Downing Street to appoint him health secretary on Friday 5 July, the exchanges behind closed doors were entirely cordial.

But things rarely run 100% smoothly in the first days of a new administration as a complete government jigsaw is put together, piece by piece.

According to a well-placed source, when Streeting left the prime minister’s office, Bridget Phillipson was waiting her turn outside. A very senior civil servant was helping to oversee the process and, ushering Streeting out and Phillipson in, is said to have mistakenly referred to the former as “education secretary”.

“Not surprisingly, it did not go down well [with Phillipson], until he corrected himself,” said the source. “Bridget got the job she expected, but for a second or two, things were apparently a bit tense, to say the least.”

Broadly speaking, however, the transition from Tory to a Labour administration has gone as smoothly as anyone could have hoped for. In some instances, it has gone rather too well.

When Ed Miliband walked into the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero and addressed civil servants for the first time, there was so much cheering and “whooping” that a senior mandarin in the department had to tell those making the noise to pipe down, fearing it sounded more like a political rally than a respectful welcome from an entirely neutral Whitehall machine.

“I think the intended message was that you can’t, as civil servants, make it sound too much like you are thrilled to have the Tories out, even though it felt like everyone was,” said an insider.

Similarly rapturous welcomes were given to other new ministers: Liz Kendall at work and pensions, Phillipson at education and Shabana Mahmood at justice.

On Monday afternoon, when Streeting addressed staff assembled in the canteen at the Department of Health and Social Care, the place was stuffed to overflowing. Streeting had invited NHS England employees to be there too, to show that he wanted everyone to work together to mend what he has called a “broken” service.

Streeting told them he wanted to be challenged and presented with hard truths. “There was an incredible atmosphere,” said one person who was there. Another said: “It was like a massive, massive relief and change of mood.”

This weekend, the new government is enjoying, and feeding off, a wave of positivity, not just in Westminster and Whitehall but across the country.

Somewhat fortunately for Starmer and his ministers, their moment – and the arrival of 334 new MPs in Westminster – has coincided with a patriotic frenzy caused by England reaching the final of Euro 2024 and some better economic news. Friday’s Financial Times led with the headline: “Sterling surges as GDP data buoys Labour growth agenda” – wrapping the themes of political and economic optimism into one.

Members of the new government seemed genuinely excited and encouraged last week by the public response to Westminster’s changing of the guard. “The most striking thing for me,” said one front-rank Labour minister, “is how many people have just come up to me in the street or on the train and said: ‘So glad you are there, good luck – so pleased to have seen the back of the Tories.’”

In parliament, the new intake arrived on Monday and Tuesday in massed ranks, symbols of a new political era, many of them youthful, wide-eyed and in awe.

Vikki Slade, the new Liberal Democrat MP for Mid Dorset and North Poole, could not believe how her workplace functioned and the reverence with which she was treated from the off. “I was walking towards the members’ lobby [outside the chamber] and two officials just opened the doors for me, on either side, to let me through. I couldn’t believe it,” she said.

Her colleague James MacCleary, who won Lewes for the Lib Dems, felt he was suffering from “impostor syndrome” when he was shown a round the Commons chamber. “I said I presumed I was not allowed to sit down on the green benches yet and they said: ‘You are an MP now – of course you are allowed to sit there.’”

Some long-serving MPs, veterans of the previous parliament, said they felt a little left out, as if tainted by association with discredited political times. “The new intake is getting all the attention. We have to do something to show it is not just about them,” said one. “It is all a bit weird.”

Recently appointed Labour ministers who had worked for their moment for years struggled to sum up their feelings. Speaking to the Observer after a day in post, one said: “I have gone from a pokey office in Portcullis House to a floor of a major department with the civil servants all around. It is quite extraordinary. Suddenly, I feel like we have this massive opportunity to get things done.”

But will they succeed? Behind the euphoria, there is trepidation. Labour ministers and MPs know full well that the honeymoon will not last.

They are asking themselves how, given the dire state of public services – overcrowded prisons, an overburdened and understaffed NHS, schools with crumbling buildings and a shortage of teachers – and the lack of money in Treasury coffers, can they turn things around before the public mood sours again?

Another new minister said there was absolutely no time to waste. “I would say we have two and a half years to make an impression before the nerves set in again,” he said. His point was after that juncture, his party, which secured just under 34% of the vote on 4 July despite gaining a huge majority, would be too fearful of threats from the left and right to do bold things and would start worrying about the next election.

Over recent days, a good start has been made. The new chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has pledged a return to compulsory housebuilding targets and Miliband has revoked the Tories’ de facto ban on onshore windfarms.

Very deliberately, however, much of the emphasis has been on demonstrating the extent of the mess left by the Conservatives. Streeting’s remarks about the broken NHS, and Starmer and Mahmood’s decision to approve the release of thousands of prisoners to prevent a total breakdown in law and order, were not only designed to discredit the past regime but also to buy Labour time.

“The more we can show how badly they left everything, the more people will realise it is not easy to fix and how important responsible government now is,” said a Labour strategist.

In a column for Friday’s Guardian on his first week running the country, Starmer wrote of the Tory record: “Like a Downing Street party, they’ve left a mountain of mess for this government to clean up.”

Confidence among the new team of Labour ministers and MPs has been bolstered by the way Starmer has settled in so fast, seeming at ease with so much power and responsibility at his fingertips.

As opposition leader and throughout the election campaign, the adjectives “dull” and “wooden” stuck to him like glue. “Now he looks like he was absolutely made to be prime minister,” said one of his senior ministers.

On his first overseas trip as the nation’s leader, to a Nato summit in Washington DC, Starmer looked and sounded the part, appearing centre stage in team photos, easefully handling a meeting with the increasingly frail US president, Joe Biden, joking about the football and, afterwards, effortlessly batting away questions about the president’s mental state.

On the way to Washington, Starmer had oozed confidence, risking a comment about England never having missed a single penalty under this Labour government. He and his wife, Victoria, have also received positive photo spreads in the pages of the Daily Mail, the Times and the Daily Telegraph. On Saturday, in an article in the Daily Mail, the rightwing columnist Leo McKinstry wrote: “As an unwavering opponent of Labour I was dreading Labour’s socialist new dawn. But even I am reassured by Starmer’s promising first week after years of chaos and division.”

This week, King Charles will unveil the new government’s legislative programme for the forthcoming session of parliament. Amid great pageantry, Starmer and Rishi Sunak will walk side by side from the House of Commons to the Lords before the speech is read out. What they will discuss on the short journey will be the subject of much speculation among the commentators.

The king’s speech will contain a range of important bills on the NHS, standards in schools, mental health, energy and the environment. The message will be one of continued momentum, improving the nation’s key public services and the pursuit above all of economic growth.

The following day, Starmer will host more than 45 European leaders at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire for a meeting of the European Political Community.

Much of the emphasis will be on closer defence cooperation between the UK and EU. But it is also expected that Starmer will use the occasion to start rebuilding relations with our European neighbours in a broader sense, both economically and politically, post-Brexit.

One minister with some knowledge of the brief remarked: “I don’t think you will hear anything dramatic but there will be a change of tone. It will be another indication that this government wants to show it is serious about changing the country for the better.”","A large group of people in business attire, with the logo of 'The Observer' at the bottom.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BA364C3A0>,2024-07-14 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/14/a-massive-relief-and-a-change-of-mood-how-did-keir-starmers-first-week-in-power-go,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/4df4674b2b.png
91a0ee06d2,CNN,Opinion: The other former president who used Trump’s playbook – and lost - CNN,"Editor’s Note: Sean Jacobs is full professor of international affairs at the New School and the founder and editor of the website Africa is a Country. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.

I arrived in South Africa shortly before last month’s national elections. I was attending a conference on the country’s 1994 transition from white minority rule to democracy in Stellenbosch, a university town about a 30-minute drive east of Cape Town.

The conference participants were mostly local academics in our early to mid-50s; all of us had voted for the first time in our 20s in 1994, the year of South Africa’s first free election.

Riding the shuttle from the airport, we saw very few campaign posters on the streets; still, the upcoming elections were on everyone’s mind. Most of us rightly assumed the African National Congress (ANC) – the party of Nelson Mandela – would lose its majority after 30 years and be forced to govern via a coalition.

But the figure of former President Jacob Zuma and his new political party uMkhonto – or simply “MK” – provoked more reaction.

The group discussed him – and his Zulu-nationalist-flavored populism – with a mix of dark humor and trepidation.

After the conference, I met up with a close friend, Herman Wasserman. We started our journalism careers together in the early 1990s, and later, both went into academia. These days, Herman is a professor of journalism at Stellenbosch University, where he researches disinformation.

We discussed the upcoming elections and the parallels between Zuma and Donald Trump’s attempted comeback as president of the United States, where I have lived with my family for the past two decades.

We now have two former presidents with questionable ethics, legal troubles and significant evidence of misogyny, their children thrust into the spotlight to defend and work for them, casting doubts on the electoral system and slippery principles, running on personalistic populism with a base that includes people unafraid to engage in political violence.

Moreover, according to Herman, pro-Zuma conspiracy theories and propaganda, some with Russian fingerprints, had been flooding South African social media in the lead-up to the election.

Still, despite the parallels, there are key differences that tell a bigger story of how these countries perceive democracy. And even as Zuma takes pages from Trump’s playbook, South Africans may be telling a different narrative.

Zuma’s rise, fall and comeback. Sound familiar?

Zuma was renowned for his resistance against apartheid. He was arrested at 17, sent to Robben Island – where Mandela was also imprisoned – for 10 years, then spent a long time as an ANC operative, mostly in exile.

Rising (and falling and rising again) in the ANC, he became president in 2009, but his tenure was marred by economic decline and further corruption scandals (what South Africans call “state capture”).

Facing pressure, Zuma resigned as South African president in 2018. Three years later, he was convicted of contempt of court for defying a commission investigating corruption and served a brief stint in jail.

His imprisonment triggered violent protests by his supporters. Zuma was released on medical parole after two months, marking the end of a tumultuous era in South African politics.

Since then, miraculously, he has recovered enough to start a political party. (Though he himself is barred from running for parliament because of his 2021 conviction.)

Policy-wise, Zuma’s MK is a mixed bag. Most alarmingly, it plans to abolish the constitution, which forms the cornerstone of South Africa’s democracy, and return to apartheid-era parliamentary sovereignty with the addition of an upper house of traditional leaders.

It taps into economic populism, promising radical changes like reclaiming land without compensation to address historical disparities, and seeks to solve the country’s energy crisis (planned periodic blackouts, or “load shedding,” have become common), by dumping plans for safe, green energy in favor of coal and nuclear power.

Other proposals tap into cultural conservatism; the party proposes reinstating the death penalty and curtailing LGBTQ+ rights.

A lesson in how (not) to accept defeat

Predictions that the ANC would lose its majority were quickly confirmed. Ultimately, the ANC received just over 40% of the vote, down from 57% in 2019. The real surprise of this election and the largest beneficiary of the ANC’s slump was MK. They finished third with just over 14% of the vote.

Since neither the ANC nor MK is inclined to cooperate, the ANC is now poised to govern in a coalition with three other parties. These parties, including the white-run Democratic Alliance (DA), favored by elites, have historically been to the right of the ANC in terms of economic and social policy. The DA opposes affirmative action and a minimum wage, and in the Western Cape, the provincial government and municipalities like Cape Town governed by the DA, they have not built a single public housing unit in a former white area since 2009. For most, however, this is preferable to bringing Zuma’s brand of politics back into government.

Some parties complained about minor discrepancies in the results, but all except the MK endorsed them.

On the eve of the announcement of the final results, Zuma and his daughter Duduzile arrived with a large entourage at the electoral commission headquarters.

Duduzile told reporters that MK’s goal was to return the country to the “nine amazing years” of her father’s presidency. For his part, Zuma announced (falsely) that, in fact, his party had won with a two-thirds majority, warned the commission not to announce any other result, and that doing so would “provoke” him and his party and “and start trouble when there is no trouble.”

When the country’s chief justice declared that the new parliament would have to convene on June 14th to elect a new president and senior parliamentary offices, form a government, and announce a cabinet, Zuma notified the media that his party would ask the constitutional court (ironically, the very court MK wants to abolish) to prevent Parliament from sitting because of supposed electoral fraud. (No evidence of such fraud was produced and the court declined his request.)

Even though Zuma’s threats have previously led to violence, as in July 2021, most people looked at Zuma and MK’s latest antics with amusement and dismay. Zuma is 82 years old, and in media interviews, he appears tired, incoherent and confused.

Zuma’s cries of a rigged election made the Trump comparison even more inescapable than it already seemed. (Indeed, this past March, Duduzile tweeted an unmistakably doctored video depicting Trump endorsing her father and urging “all South Africans to vote for uMkhonto weSizwe.”)

On various social media platforms, exasperated South African voters jestingly liken Donald Trump to the Jacob Zuma of America. Moreover, it’s striking how swiftly Zuma’s supporters, just like many Trump supporters, align themselves with Putin and Russia, often endorsing conspiracy theories surrounding Covid-19 or expressing general opposition to medical science, facts-based politics and journalism.

Where the Zuma-Trump comparison ends

However, South Africa isn’t the United States. Despite Zuma’s disruptive, wrecker campaign, South Africans prioritize political moderation over populism. Even though only roughly half of registered voters participated, citizens still trust social and political institutions as the vehicle for social progress rather than reject them entirely.

Indeed, even though Zuma has borrowed so heavily from Trump’s playbook, the outcome of this election seems to me to signal the United States’ waning influence on South Africa’s popular consciousness.

Under Apartheid, some Black South Africans looked to the United States, especially its Black community operating in the heart of American capitalism, for inspiration.

For Black South Africans, despite our very radical political vision, America was the idealized place they saw in films and TV, a place of the American dream. For others like me, the radicalism of African Americans attracted us to the US.

A year after I voted for the first time, I received a Fulbright Fellowship to complete an MA in political science in the US. I returned at the end of 1996 to a newly confident South Africa governed by President Nelson Mandela.

Over time, increased travel, 24-hour news channels and the rise of social media gave South Africans a different view, an unfiltered insight, into the US’ many dysfunctions.

Though some South Africans still admire the US’ capitalist spirit, I find that the South African friends who visit me in the US don’t always feel at ease anymore.

They also notice how shamelessly America treats its poor, sick, low-waged and homeless. There’s no safety net, unlike in South Africa, where social grants (what Americans call welfare) are a permanent fixture of our politics; the government recently signed into law a national health insurance scheme and is contemplating introducing universal basic income.

And unlike in the US, South Africa is less anxious about this year’s historic change in our electoral politics. The fact that the ANC, the party of Mandela associated with liberation, is bloated and corrupt and, for the first time, did not secure a parliamentary majority is not seen as a failure – but proof of our democracy in action.

South Africans are busy forging their own alliances in the world – increased trading with China, hosting the BRICS summit of major emerging economies, charging Israel with genocide at the International Court of Justice, and positioning themselves as a continental and Global South leader.

When Trump was elected US president for the first time in November 2016, I watched the results with American friends and family in New York City. They were devastated. But my honest reaction was: “I’ve lived through apartheid. We can get through this.”

I wouldn’t wish a Trump victory on the US, but whether it’s Biden or Trump, the next US president won’t figure as significantly in South Africans’ lives as they did when South Africa first became a democracy.

There’s something to note about our homegrown political horizons – we’ve always had our vision of a prosperous society, distinct from the “American dream.”

This uniqueness, while advantageous, also leads to our own strains of exceptionalism, now tested by political fragmentation. Hopefully, figures like Zuma, who mimic American politics, won’t figure as significantly either.",A black and white photo of a person holding a microphone with a sign that reads 'The other former president who used Trump's playbook - and lost - CNN'.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA4FE78E0>,2024-06-26 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/26/opinions/south-africa-jacob-zuma-trump-former-president-jacobs/index.html,['Opinion/Editorial' 'Politics' 'International'],[0.95 0.85 0.8 ],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/91a0ee06d2.png
f60a324d8e,The Globe and Mail,Opinion: Phil Donahue had an impact on many. That includes me - The Globe and Mail,"Phil Donahue made my mother uncomfortable.

When he began to make a name for himself as a morning TV talk show host in the 1970s, she often sat on the end of the living room couch, unsure about the subject matter on Mr. Donahue’s show.

Abortion. Cross-dressing. Lesbianism. These were not topics she was interested in exploring to any great degree. She liked celebrity interviews. “Why doesn’t he just stick to those?” she would say.

And yet, she did acknowledge one thing about the man: he was a full-throated supporter of the feminist cause. He was on women’s side, without hesitation, on almost every outstanding issue of the day. That, she quietly admired.

I, meantime, was an unabashed Phil Donahue fan. I loved that he was not afraid to stir things up, tackle hard subjects that heretofore were seen as taboo. He was a liberal, through and through. Yes, he was a talk show host, an entertainer, but at his heart he was a journalist, always probing, challenging conventional wisdom, asking the uneasy question.

For those lucky enough to get a seat in his audience, there was always a chance you might get asked for your opinion on a particular topic or asked to pose a question to a guest.

Most often the audience members he put a microphone in front of were women, whose opinions back in the ‘70s and ‘80s were too often ignored.

Mr. Donahue died on Sunday at the age of 88 after a lengthy illness, according to his family. The moment unleashed a torrent of prepared obituaries that chronicled his amazing, consequential life. Talk show legend Oprah Winfrey conceded that without Phil Donahue there would have been no Oprah. He was a trailblazer.

Sometimes you don’t think about someone for years and then, suddenly, their past presence in your life rushes to the surface. That’s what happened when I began to recall the impact Mr. Donahue had on me and my decision to become a journalist.

Watergate was the seminal event that led to that decision but Phil Donahue was the person who regularly stirred my interest in the events of the day, the hot topics. His easy charm and beguiling personal style made him easy to like. Looking back, he was the first real male feminist I knew.

As much as my three sisters helped shape my view of the feminine world, Mr. Donahue worked on my brain in this regard too. “If Sigmund Freud had watched Phil Donahue he would never have wondered what women want,” Nora Ephron wrote in her 1983 best-selling novel Heartburn.

My views on the Catholic church were also shaped by Mr. Donahue. He was raised Catholic like I was. But he seldom held back from offering often withering criticism of the institution, calling it “unnecessarily destructive.” I wasn’t surprised to read in the New York Times obituary of Mr. Donahue that he had years ago left the church over his differences with it.

Of course, I did not watch Donahue daily. It was hit and miss. But whenever I did tune it, he seldom disappointed me, seldom didn’t make my late-teenager, early-twenties-self, think a little.

He wasn’t perfect. It did seem that he began to chase ratings a little bit, especially late in his 29-year run. He likely began to feel pressure from upstart rivals such as Geraldo Rivera and Jerry Springer, whose sensation-seeking, over-the-top shows began attracting wider audiences. (Mr. Donahue would later refer to them as his “illegitimate children.”) Perhaps rattled by their success, Mr. Donahue wasn’t above stooping down to their levels, although he never seemed particularly at ease doing it.

In 1996, he packed it in.

Six years later, he was lured back to television when MSNBC offered him a primetime interview show. It happened at a difficult time in American history, as the contentious, U.S.-ignited Iraq war was unfolding. Mr. Donahue was not a fan of the incursion, and much to the consternation of the suits who ran NBC seldom held back from expressing those views on air. The network bosses wanted his show to be more onside with the war, something Mr. Donahue wasn’t able to do.

Six months into his new gig he was fired.

While it was considered by many an ignominious end to a brilliant career, I viewed it much differently. Phil Donahue left the business with his dignity intact. If anything, his view of the war proved to be the right one. His firing should be regarded as a badge of honour.

Phil Donahue was a giant of the talk show world who left an indelible, inspiring imprint on many. While he’ll certainly be missed, his legacy will live on.","An older man in a suit and tie speaks into a microphone in front of a crowd, with some audience members looking attentively at him.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BC793E350>,2024-08-20 13:35:31.677000+00:00,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-phil-donahue-had-an-impact-on-many-that-includes-me/,['Opinion/Editorial' 'Entertainment'],[0.95 0.85],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/f60a324d8e.png

But the Trump campaign is also executing an unconventional strategy: In the final days, it’s reducing traditional ground-game operations to focus more on rallies, calls and texts, per the AP. Trump has spent most of the past month at Mar-a-Lago, relying on surrogates instead of campaigning himself, NBC’s Vaughn Hillyard, Jake Traylor and Dan Gallo report from Des Moines. He’s choosing to head to court in D.C. and New York two days this week instead of Iowa.

Today’s conservative evangelicals are less likely to be regular churchgoers than in generations past; the single-minded focus on issues like abortion has diminished.

9e55dec8d4,The Guardian,Netanyahu’s political survival in hands of far-right ministers - The Guardian,"Israel’s national security minister presented himself before the television cameras to make a statement on Sunday, shortly after leaving a meeting with the country’s prime minister.

Invoking divine support, Itamar Ben-Gvir said he had “warned the prime minister that if God forbids it, Israel will not enter a ceasefire”. He said Benjamin Netanyahu “promised that Israel would enter Rafah, that the war would not end, and promised that there will be no irresponsible deal”.

The following Tuesday, Israeli troops had entered the Philadelphi corridor on the southern border with Egypt and taken control of the Rafah border crossing, hoisting Israeli flags from the terminal.

The sequencing of the two events was revealing. Faced once again with the threat posed by a fringe and extremist politician – who Netanyahu had elevated into government – the prime minister had given every appearance of blinking, underlining his reliance on far-right coalition allies such as Ben-Gvir and the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich.

The two are widely assessed to hold Netanyahu’s future political survival in their hands. While Netanyahu could survive them quitting his coalition over a ceasefire deal with Hamas or the failure to launch a full-scale assault on Rafah, the politics of the Israeli right threaten him in more fundamental ways.

During the course of the war, the uncompromising position of Ben-Gvir in particular has widened support for his extremist brand of politics, attracting some on the right of Netanyahu’s Likud party.

A settler and lawyer, Ben-Gvir was cleared by Israel’s high court to serve as a cabinet minister despite convictions for incitement to racism and for supporting a terror group – Meir Kahane’s banned Kach party. In 2015, in the immediate aftermath of the murder of members of the Palestinian Dawabshe family in an arson attack on a West Bank village, he was filmed as an attender at a wedding party of a radical settler along with now sanctioned anti-Arab activist Bentzi Gopstein.

In the footage, guests could be seen stabbing a picture of Ali Dawabshe, a toddler who died during the attack, waving guns and firebombs and singing. Netanyahu, who described the images as “shocking”, would later give Ben-Gvir a portfolio with responsibility for Israel’s police.

The conditions of Israel’s illegal occupation of the West Bank have become ever more extreme under the influence of Ben-Gvir and Smotrich, prompting an escalating round of international sanctions against those involved in settler violence.

Smotrich was arrested in 2005, with three others, during the Israeli evacuation of the Gaza settlements by the Shin Bet domestic security agency on suspicion of terrorism, although he was released three weeks later without charge.

He has described himself as a “proud homophobe” and stated that Israel’s judicial system should be based on Torah law.

During the seven months of the war in Gaza, Ben-Gvir and Smotrich have pushed the most hardline positions.

According to reports in the Hebrew media last month, Ben-Gvir demanded of the Israeli chief of staff at a briefing: “Why are there so many arrests [in Gaza]?

“Can’t you kill some? Do you want to tell me they all surrender? What are we to do with so many arrested? It’s dangerous for the soldiers.”

An unnamed Israeli minister quoted by Ynet said Ben-Gvit had not explicitly suggested killing individuals who had surrendered.

What seems increasingly clear, however, is that in bending to the bidding of the far-right fringe, including over Rafah and a ceasefire, Netanyahu is increasingly out of step with the majority of Israelis.

A series of polls in recent days, including for the Israel Democracy Institute, has found that 56% of the Jewish public believe that a deal to secure the release of hostages should take top priority, compared with a third who believe that an offensive against Rafah should be the government’s main focus.

A poll for Israel’s Channel 13 tells a similar story of scepticism in the Israel public, with 52% believing a Rafah operation will not deliver victory against Hamas, compared with 30% who believe it will. Perhaps most striking, however, is a poll by rightwing newspaper Israel Hayom, which found that 28% thought the “preferred victory picture” would represent the hostages’ release, while 17% chose an image representing the destruction of Hamas.

ca882b6d90,Financial Times,Companies count the cost of compliance with green regulation - Financial Times,"Europe’s Green Deal to tackle climate change has produced plenty of red tape for businesses. Since it was agreed in 2019, with the aim of achieving climate neutrality by 2050, dozens of laws have been introduced.

Companies have new obligations to audit their supply chains for environmental damage and human rights violations, to prove that commodities such as beef and coffee do not come from deforested land, and to ensure more products can be repaired.

Richard Sterneberg, head of global government relations at law firm DLA Piper, says the volume is unprecedented. “There is a lot of regulation coming down the track at the same time. The compliance costs are high and it is easier for the bigger companies to comply.”

Some companies have decided simply to ditch suppliers in countries that may not be able to assemble the data needed to comply with the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive. Passed by the European parliament last month, and due to come into force by 2027, the law requires EU and non-EU companies with significant turnover in the bloc to ensure that their supply chains do not harm workers or the environment.

Other companies may quit the EU, instead. “Legislation is having an impact on investment flows coming into Europe,” Sterneberg says. “The EU wants to set the agenda, globally, but other countries are not following suit so there is not a level playing field.”

Continuing with business as usual is condemning our economy as well as people’s health and the environment to a grim future

The Green Deal has created a bonanza for his industry, however. Thomas Delille, a partner in the EU public policy practice at law firm Squire Patton Boggs, says his team has been expanding fast.

“Various pieces of EU legislation have placed a new generation of obligations on economic operators, centred on the concept of due diligence,” he says. “Very often, companies need to start working on their compliance despite a lack of guidance on how to interpret and implement the law.”

Many companies are reluctant to talk about costs. But one multinational, which did not want to be identified, tells the FT that the only cost-effective way to comply with the 2023 Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive is to digitalise everything — which can be difficult in some developing countries where suppliers still provide paper invoices.

The CSRD, which will apply to reports published from next year, demands information about companies’ impact on people and the environment, allowing investors to assess the financial risks and opportunities arising from sustainability issues.

The company estimates it has spent $18mn in the past three years on automating its carbon emissions data, and expects to spend another $50mn-$60mn over the next three to five years to comply fully with the CSRD. On top of this, it anticipates millions of dollars in annual costs for data compliance and auditing.

The company will also have to comply with the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, at a cost of at least $500,000 a year. The CBAM is intended to protect EU heavy industry, which must pay for its carbon emissions under the bloc’s emissions trading scheme, from being undercut by producers in countries with more lenient rules. From 2030, it will levy a charge on imports of steel, cement and other products to account for the carbon emitted while making them.

Importers are responsible for providing the information. The first reports were due this year but only 10 per cent of German companies, for example, complied by the initial January deadline.

In a recent analysis of EU policymaking, Zach Meyers, assistant director of the Centre for European Reform think-tank, says the European Commission, in its attempts to deal with crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic and climate change, “has become a more political body”.

This means, he argues, that the EU “has lost one of its strengths: having a technocratic lawmaking body focused on designing laws based on evidence and good practice, and which is less beholden to short-term politics than the European parliament and European Council”.

He says the commission has rushed consultation with industry, often uses emergency procedures to avoid impact assessments, and increasingly uses so-called delegated acts, which are not scrutinised by the other institutions or subject to open debate.

NGOs, however, support the changes, although many proposals were watered down by EU governments before they approved them.

Amandine Van Den Berghe, lawyer with environmental organisation ClientEarth, says: “The climate, biodiversity and pollution crises are here now and already causing business disruption. Continuing with business as usual — or, worse, deregulating — is condemning our economy as well as people’s health and the environment to a grim future.

“The CSDDD is not reinventing the wheel — it turns voluntary international standards that have existed for over a decade into binding rules. The law was developed in response to requests from the private sector to bring clarity and harmonisation to a fragmented EU legislative landscape, as well as calls from civil society for more responsible business conduct.”

She says many companies and investors support it.

We need a consistent and predictable policy, which is not changing all the time

Indeed, some businesses say it is not the amount of legislation that is the problem but the constant changes, often at national level.

Among them is Netherlands-based boiler company BDR Thermea, owner of brands such as Baxi and De Dietrich, which began transitioning from making gas boilers to electrically powered heat pumps a decade ago.

However, after protests in Germany, the government there scrapped plans to oblige householders to adopt heat pumps. Meanwhile, other countries ended subsidies or policies that mandated heat pumps in new homes. As gas prices have dropped, so has demand.

BDR Thermea, which operates globally but manufactures mainly in the EU, is now switching staff back from heat pumps to gas boilers to match demand.

“The market for heat pumps is going down,” says chief executive Tjarko Bouman.

“We need clarity on the regulations . . . and a consistent and predictable policy, which is not changing all the time,” he adds. “It creates uncertainty with consumers.”

He welcomes the CSDDD, despite its cost. “We are a key player in the energy transition. And, as such, I believe we should be a frontrunner, in being a sustainable corporation ourselves. It’s the right thing to do.”",A person in a green shirt is reaching out to a branch of a tree with green leaves.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA5C7E470>,2024-05-16 04:00:58.435000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/276028dc-a492-44ec-9eee-58d9fb51c159,['Business and Finance' 'Politics'],[0.9 0.7],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/ca882b6d90.png
405b94a36e,CBC.ca,WATCH — Nick Eh 30 is joining the Fortnite Icon Series. We asked him about it | videoclip | Kids News - CBC.ca,"We asked him to demonstrate his Fortnite emote IRL

A Canadian streamer is leaving his legacy in Fortnite in a big way.

Nick Eh 30, or Nicholas Anymoony, is joining the Fortnite Icon Series.

The Fortnite Icon Series features influential creators and celebrities. Some examples are MrBeast, Travis Scott, Ariana Grande and Ninja.

Nick Eh 30, who is from Halifax, Nova Scotia, is only the second Canadian to join the series, after The Weeknd.

“This is literally the biggest moment of my entire career.” - Nick Eh 30

The set includes:

A Nick Eh 30 outfit.

An alternate outfit style called “The King,” which features a crown (keep reading to find out why).

The “Eh Crown Pickaxe.”

The “Never Back Down Back Bling.”

An emote called “You Think You’re the King?” (Keep scrolling to watch Nick do the emote IRL!)

An “Eh Theme Wrap” to put on your gear.

Gamers will also be able to access Nick Eh 30 decals for the Cyclone Car body.

So, what does Nick Eh 30 think about joining Fortnite Icon Series?

We wanted to hear from the streaming star himself.

KN contributor Ainara Alleyne met with Nick Eh 30 over a video call to ask him some questions.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Q: How does it feel to become a Fortnite icon?

I’d say it’s not an overexaggeration to say this is literally the biggest moment of my entire career.

For almost seven years now, I’ve been dedicated to just making the best content that I can make.

I think it’s just a testament to how enjoyable Fortnite is.

So, to be recognized in this way with an Icon outfit and everything that Epic did for me with this release … it’s what I like to say, eh-mazing.

Watch Nick Eh 30 talk about the meaning behind his Icon Series set ⬇️⬇️⬇️

Q: How does it feel to be repping Canada in the Fortnite scene?

It’s a dream come true.

I feel like I’m never going to move away from Nova Scotia because my family's here, my extended family, like, everyone that I consider my friends from high school, and from junior high to university. Everyone is just so kind.

And to be able to represent a place like Nova Scotia, where I feel like there’s not many creators coming out from this spot, I think it’s amazing and I’m very grateful.

I’ll always continue to work as hard as I possibly can.

And funny enough, there’s actually a lot of cool little Easter eggs. And we have some ehs sprinkled in on the pickaxe and different things like that. So, a lot of cool shout-outs to Canada.

Watch Nick Eh 30 answer some rapid-fire questions ⬇️⬇️⬇️

Q: Talk to me about the look of your Icon Series avatar and the set.

The main thing that people are going to notice right away is the “Never back down, never give up” on the actual outfit itself.

This is like my iconic catchphrase. And it’s the motto that I live by.

We also have a king edit style.

So basically, I do these little custom games with my community where everyone can join the same match. Sometimes we make fun stories, sometimes we do Simon Says.

In one particular instance, there was a viral clip where I acted like a king, and now there's a [Fortnite outfit] where I have a crown … and I look really, really tough.

Q: Since the back bling is supposed to give players motivational messages, what’s your motivational message for kids out there watching you?

I would say the classic saying is never back down, never give up.

I think with hard work — if you really, really work hard at anything — you will see results.

Always keep working and put your best foot forward. Try to be the best version of yourself that you can possibly be.

We asked Nick Eh 30 to demonstrate his Fortnite emote ⬇️⬇️⬇️

Q: More kids might be considering careers in YouTube or streaming. What advice would you give to them?

It’s very, very important to stand out and to try to do something that no one else is doing.

It’s always good to have inspiration, and it’s always good to have those ideas from people that you enjoy. But work your hardest to bring your own twist to whatever it is that you do to give people a reason to want to watch you.

I also think it's super important to edit your own videos and to learn.

POLL — Do you think Fortnite skins are worth the money?

As you edit your own videos, you’re going to realize, like, what did I do wrong, what did I do right, when I got eliminated or when I got that win? So you improve at the game.

But then also you’re learning as you’re commentating: Did I sound confident there? Was that joke really funny? Like, can I watch back my content?

I just think there’s so much that you can learn when you're analyzing and editing your own videos.

Q: You focus a lot on positivity. What do you have to say to people who log on just to put other people down, like the haters? And what advice would you give to kids for navigating hate in online gaming?

Focus on the positive no matter what.

I try not to draw attention to any negativity. I think there's a lot of positivity if you really, really look for it.

I think that it’s always good in your life to have balance.

I always give the analogy of a house being supported by four beams as opposed to a house that’s being supported by one beam.

Let’s say that one beam is gaming, for example, and that’s the only thing that maybe you’re doing. Well, if that goes wrong, then you might feel a little down.

WATCH — Kids battle YouTuber as they research the evolution of Fortnite

But if you go back to the four beams, and you have gaming, and then you have your family as another support beam, and then you have fitness, and then you have a hobby.

If there was negativity or anything out there … it wouldn't affect you because, like, hey, I still have my family, or I still have my friends. And then you have other things going for you.

Just know that you can work hard and prove the haters wrong. So focus on you and just be the best version of yourself you can be.

5f29f416a9,TIME,"Amid TikTok Ban Threats, ByteDance Surges In Profit | TIME - TIME","While TikTok faces an uncertain future in the U.S., its Chinese parent company continues to rake in cash. On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that ByteDance’s profit jumped 60% in 2023 to more than $40 billion, compared to $25 billion in 2022, citing people familiar with the matter. Despite a slowed Chinese economy, ByteDance has been buoyed by TikTok’s massive global popularity, especially in the U.S.—TikTok has 170 million American users, and a Pew study from January found it was the fastest-growing social media platform in the country. This marks the first time that ByteDance has outpaced its rival Tencent in revenue and profit. Last fall, ByteDance unveiled TikTok Shop in the U.S., in which entrepreneurs can sell products directly from the app itself. In China, ByteDance’s app Douyin has rolled out e-commerce and food delivery features. The company is also building on its own chatbots and its own large language model in the hopes of competing with OpenAI. But as TikTok has grown in influence and usership in the U.S., backlash has also ballooned. In March, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill giving ByteDance two choices: sell the app, or face a ban in the U.S. The bill has received wide bipartisan report: New York Democrat Chuck Schumer indicated that working on the bill was a priority, and President Biden said he would sign the bill if it landed on his desk. Read More: What to Know About the Bill That Could Get TikTok Banned in the U.S. But Republican leaders have been especially vocal in speaking out against TikTok recently, arguing that the app is a haven for Chinese propaganda. Former Vice President Mike Pence has spent millions via his policy organization on a campaign to pressure the Senate to pass the bill, and called its passage a “vitally important national security measure.” Mitch McConnell called TikTok “one of Beijing's favorite tools of coercion and espionage.” ByteDance admitted in 2022 that former employees “misused their authority” to surveil American journalists on TikTok. But the bill has slowed in the Senate, and faces criticism from free speech advocates and TikTok users. Defenders of the app bombarded Congressional offices with calls urging them not to ban the app. And many entrepreneurs who have come to rely on the app for their businesses have also begun speaking out. “Cutting through the connective tissue of the app will sever important ways that Americans—especially young Americans—are speaking at a time when those conversations are as rich as ever,” wrote Scott Nover in a TIME ideas essay. In the event that the bill passes the Senate, ByteDance faces several major obstacles to actually sell their prized app. The Chinese government has signaled that it will not allow a forced sale of TikTok. And given that the app is likely worth tens of billions of dollars, that price tag is only feasible for a handful of American tech giants like Google or Meta—which brings antitrust concerns into play. It is unclear which presidential candidate would be tougher on TikTok following the election. Both have sent mixed messages: Donald Trump reversed his calls for a TikTok ban, saying in March that banning the app would only increase the size of Facebook, which he called an “enemy of the people.” Biden’s National Security Council called the anti-TikTok bill “an important and welcome step.” But his campaign also recently joined TikTok in an attempt to drum up younger voter enthusiasm. Bloomberg wrote that ByteDance’s internal figures had not been independently audited. A representative for ByteDance declined to comment: “We don’t comment on market speculations,” they wrote.",The image features the TikTok logo with a dark background and grass in the foreground.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x137 at 0x7D6BD81883A0>,NaT,https://time.com,https://time.com/6965464/tiktok-profit-bans-2024/,['Business and Finance' 'Politics' 'Technology'],[0.9  0.85 0.8 ],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/5f29f416a9.png
a56b4d154f,The Associated Press,Biden beats long-shot challenger Dean Phillips in the congressman's home state of Minnesota - The Associated Press,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — President Joe Biden dealt challenger Dean Phillips a Super Tuesday defeat in the Minnesota congressman’s home state, while former President Donald Trump beat Nikki Haley in the state’s Republican primary. Minnesota has 75 Democratic and 39 Republican national convention delegates. But as one of the smaller of 16 states and one territory holding Super Tuesday primaries, Minnesota received little attention — even from Phillips, who represents a congressional district in the Minneapolis suburbs but enjoyed hardly any home-field advantage. Haley was the only candidate to put in an in-person campaign appearance. Her rally at a Bloomington hotel last week drew several hundred people, but it wasn’t enough for her to catch up to Trump. For Phillips, the only elected Democrat to challenge Biden in their party’s primary, the results from Minnesota and other Super Tuesday states extended his string of defeats. “While Democratic Party loyalists are clearly, consistently, and overwhelmingly registering their preference for Joe Biden, it doesn’t alter the reality which compelled me to enter the race in the first place; Donald Trump is increasingly likely to defeat him in November,” Phillips said in a statement. “I’ll be assessing tonight’s results and all available data over the coming days before making a decision about how I can best help prevent that tragedy.” Among nearly two dozen interviews conducted by The Associated Press over three days with Democratic voters in Phillips’ own district ahead of the primary, the three-term representative got barely a mention. Beating Trump was the most common theme they expressed. What to know about the 2024 Election Democracy: American democracy has overcome big stress tests since 2020. More challenges lie ahead in 2024.

Read the latest: Follow AP’s complete coverage of this year’s election. At a public library in suburban Eden Prairie on Tuesday, Molly Menton said she didn’t consider voting for Phillips even though he’s her congressman, saying he’s less qualified than Biden. Menton, a health care executive who leans “pretty progressive,” said her top priorities are nominating liberal judges, gun control and climate change. Eden Prairie retirees Chuck and Carol Thomas, who formerly worked as creative directors in advertising, also said after voting that they never considered voting for Phillips. Biden has wisdom, experience and a track record of beating Trump, Chuck Thomas said. The Biden campaign last week sent Doug Emhoff, Vice President Kamala Harris’ husband. He appeared at a fundraiser, visited Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport to highlight the administration’s investments in transportation infrastructure, and paid his respects to three slain first responders in Burnsville. Trump didn’t visit Minnesota for the primary, but he raised eyebrows during a phone interview with KNSI radio in St. Cloud on Monday when he claimed that he thought he won the state in the 2020 general election, echoing his false claims that he was the rightful winner nationwide. Trump actually lost Minnesota by more than 7 percentage points to Biden, but he came within 1.5 points of defeating Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016, and told KNSI he intends to take a “big shot” at winning the state this November. No Republican presidential candidate has carried Minnesota since Richard Nixon in 1972. Pam Hulstrand, of Eden Prairie, voted on the Republican side — for Haley. “It’s time for a woman,” Hulstrand said. She said Haley is a new leader with experience and confidence. “The fact that she’s not giving up says a lot about her resiliency,” she said. Hulstrand, a minister, also said she likes Haley’s conservative stance on “moral issues.” But she also said she’s prepared to vote for Trump in November, if it comes to that. At Crosspoint Church in the next-door suburb of Bloomington, Craig Brandt said he voted for Trump, “because I think he’s the best hope we have for getting our country back on track.” Sarah Alfaham, of Bloomington, said she voted “uncommitted” in the Democratic primary, as many anti-war and Muslim activists locally and nationally have urged. She said and doesn’t know for whom she’ll vote in November, except that it won’t be Trump. But she said she’s so disappointed with Biden that she might consider a third-party candidate. “I believe that the war in Gaza, and the genocide that Israel is committing, is unacceptable,” Alfaham said. “And Joe Biden has not done enough to earn my vote and not done enough to stop the war, stop the massacre.” ___ This story has been corrected to show that Trump claimed he thought he won the state in the 2020 general election, not the 2022 election. It has also been corrected to show that Trump came within 1.5 points of defeating Hillary Clinton in 2016, not 2018. ___ Ahmed reported from Eden Prairie and Vancleave from Bloomington.

a2f5daac0f,Newsmax,Trump in West Palm Beach to See Son Barron Graduate - Newsmax,"Former President Donald Trump joined his wife Melania in West Palm Beach, Florida, Friday morning to see their 18-year-old son Barron graduate from high school.

According to the Daily Mail, two police snipers kept a close eye on the events at Oxbridge Academy, with U.S. Marshals officers and deputies from the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office patrolling the highway and cordoning off the sidewalk in anticipation of Trump’s arrival.

Chatting and smiling, students’ families reportedly took their seats in the bleachers of the elite college prep school as the student band played Verdi. According to the Mail, they were asked to arrive several hours early to be screened by Secret Service prior to the event.

Trump’s 10-vehicle motorcade pulled up to the school just minutes before the ceremony began, according to the Mail, and a quick glimpse of the former president before he entered a heavily-guarded area revealed he was wearing a dark suit, white shirt and blue tie.

The crowd reportedly gave Trump a round of applause and he took his seat next to Melania and her father, Viktor Knavs, at the front of the bleachers. The former first lady was wearing a navy blazer and a straw hat, according to the Mail.

With the current court schedule for his New York paperwork trial keeping him in Manhattan four days a week, Trump’s ability to attend his youngest child’s graduation was initially uncertain. Late last month, Judge Juan Merchan granted the former president’s petition to pause the trial so that he could attend the 10 a.m. ceremony.

Oxbridge, an exclusive school for students in grades six through 12, was founded in 2011 by billionaire William Koch, the brother of Republican mega-donors Charles and David Koch.

With graduation completed, Barron’s next course has yet to be charted.

Trump had told Megyn Kelly last year that Barron was “thinking about” attending his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, where older children Ivanka, Donald Trump Jr. and Tiffany also attended.

Rumors had also circulated that Barron was considering attending New York University, which could prompt Melania to move back to New York with him. Nothing has been confirmed, however.

During an event on May 9 at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Trump suggested that the anti-Israel protests on college campuses could influence Barron’s decision about where to ultimately enroll.

“Right now, he's doing a great job,” Trump said in a clip posted on X. “He has great marks. He's going to be going to college soon. And we're looking at some colleges that are different [than] they were two months ago.”",A man in a blue suit and tie waves to the crowd while standing next to a woman in a floral dress.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x187 at 0x7D6BA3F4AD40>,2024-05-17 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.newsmax.com,https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/donald-trump-barron-trump-oxbridge-academy/2024/05/17/id/1165150/,['Politics' 'Local/Regional'],[0.85 0.75],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/a2f5daac0f.png
62f5f34296,Financial Times,Thames Water’s credit rating slashed to ‘junk’ - Financial Times,"Thames Water has had its credit rating slashed to “junk” status by Moody’s, threatening to put the troubled UK utility in breach of its licence and piling more pressure on its £16.5bn debt pile.

US credit rating agency Moody’s on Wednesday downgraded Thames two notches to Ba2 — putting it below investment-grade and into so-called “junk” territory — citing the water company’s “weakening liquidity position” and the potential for covenant breaches on its debt.

The water utility needs to maintain two investment-grade ratings in order to comply with its licence, unless water regulator Ofwat makes an exception and allows a degree of leniency. Rating agency S&P said earlier this month that it could also downgrade the utility’s safest class of bonds, which have the lowest investment-grade rating.

Thames Water said that it had alerted Ofwat “to the possibility of potential credit rating downgrades in April 2024 and continues to work with Ofwat to maintain the ongoing financial resilience of the business”.

The ratings downgrade could also raise the cost of borrowing for the company, which provides water and sewage services to about 16mn households and is seeking to avoid being taken over by the government’s special administration regime — a form of temporary renationalisation.

The Sar could be triggered if the company is unable to repay its debts or is found to be in breach of its main duties to provide efficient water supply and sewerage systems.

The company says it has enough cash to last until next May but needs to raise £750mn in equity from investors by then, and a further £2.5bn by 2030.

Thames Water’s shareholders — which include pension funds Omers of Canada, Britain’s USS universities scheme and several sovereign-wealth funds — in April declared the business was “uninvestable” and backtracked on a commitment to invest a further £500mn.

While Thames Water is seeking new investors, it could struggle to attract fresh capital due to limitations Ofwat placed on potential bill rises for consumers. In a draft ruling earlier this month, Ofwat proposed water bill increases of around a fifth, far short of the average 33 per cent requested by UK water companies.

Moody’s on Wednesday noted that without a fresh equity injection Thames Water “forecasts a breach in its trigger event financial ratios”, meaning it will have to seek approval from bondholders to borrow more money.

The financing model used by Thames Water, in which cash flows service different tiers of debt, tends to result in higher investment-grade ratings for top-ranked bonds than standard corporate bonds at companies with similar levels of debt.

Moody’s ratings action means that the utility’s top-ranked “class A” bonds are now ranked just below investment-grade, while its second-ranking “Class B” bonds have slipped deeper into junk territory.

Some of Thames Water’s class A bonds are now trading at less than 70p in the pound, suggesting that even top-ranking bondholders are braced for deep haircuts, while its Class B bonds are quoted at just a quarter of face value.

On top of the £16.5bn of debt at Thames Water’s regulated utility, its parent company has further borrowings, taking the group’s overall debt burden to over £18bn.

Bonds at parent company Kemble Water — named after a village in the English countryside near the source of the river Thames — are already in default with investors braced for near-total losses.

Sir Keir Starmer told the House of Commons on Wednesday that the government would meet the bosses of failing water companies “to hold them to account for their performance”.

“Customers should not pay the price for mismanagement by water companies and we’ve already announced steps to put water companies under a tougher regime,” the prime minister said.

Matthew Topham, of We Own It, which campaigns for renationalisation, said:

“Special Administration must be deployed to defend the public interest by transferring Thames into permanent public ownership.

“Only then can the government stabilise the business by unlocking faster and cheaper investment — while protecting the public from paying the costs of privatisation failures.”","A woman stands next to a Thames Water van, looking at her phone.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA2ECABC0>,2024-07-24 13:45:47.946000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/7d79cf75-8f67-4f27-a6a1-507640b77f7e,['Business and Finance' 'Local/Regional'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/62f5f34296.png
220720d5c9,Financial Times,US to redirect Patriot air defence orders to Ukraine - Financial Times,"The US is pausing the delivery of Patriot interceptor missiles to other nations so it can fast-track orders for Ukraine to bolster its air defences against Russian attacks.

US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby on Thursday confirmed that the US had made the “difficult but necessary decision” to prioritise delivering Patriot and NASAM missiles to Ukraine, delaying deliveries to other countries that had purchased them so that Kyiv can maintain its stockpiles “at a key moment in the war”.

“We’re going to reprioritise the deliveries of these exports so that those missiles rolling off the production line will now be provided to Ukraine,” he added, saying the shipments were expected to begin in the late summer.

“This . . . demonstrates our commitment to supporting our partners when they’re in existential danger,” Kirby said.

The decision to bring Kyiv to the front of the production queue, as reported by the Financial Times earlier on Thursday, follows President Joe Biden saying last week that he had secured commitments for the delivery of additional air defence systems to Ukraine.

Biden said several nations had agreed to send Patriot and other air defence systems to Kyiv, and that other countries expecting deliveries would have to wait because “everything we have is going to go to Ukraine until their needs are met”.

Standing beside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after the two signed a 10-year defence pact on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Puglia, Biden added that Kyiv would begin receiving more systems “relatively quickly”.

Zelenskyy said he was “deeply grateful” to Biden and the US “for prioritising Ukraine in the delivery of air defences that we critically need to defeat Russian attacks”.

“These additional air defence capabilities will protect Ukrainian cities and civilians,” he added.

Kirby confirmed that countries that had already ordered the missiles would receive them, but “on a delayed timeline”.

Washington has briefed all affected countries privately; air defence exports to Taiwan are not expected to be affected. The White House looked at re-sequencing the delivery of air defence systems as well as interceptors and was open to doing so. But ultimately it opted to pursue a “parallel” and “intensive” effort to get Ukraine additional existing air defence systems, a senior White House official said.

Romania on Thursday decided to donate one Patriot system to Ukraine, according to the office of President Klaus Iohannis. Zelenskyy thanked Romania for its “crucial contribution”.

Spain and Greece also have Patriots in their arsenals, but have declined to authorise transfers of launch systems to Ukraine. Poland has said its Patriots are protecting the infrastructure used to ship western weaponry across its border into Ukraine, and thus are already deployed to help protect the war-torn country.

In addition, Italy said this month it would send Kyiv a second SAMP/T air defence system, a European-made alternative to the Patriot.

The US-made Patriot systems are Washington’s most advanced air defence weapons. They consist of a radar system and mobile launchers that can fire interceptor missiles at incoming projectiles or aircraft.

Zelenskyy has called them “the most effective air defence system in the world today” and said they were capable of shooting down all Russian missiles, including ballistic ones. He said in April that “to protect Ukraine completely, in the future, Ukraine would need 25 Patriot systems with six to eight batteries each”.

He and foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba have since told Nato allies that Ukraine needs a minimum of seven Patriot systems to effectively cover the country’s airspace.

Ukraine has at least four Patriot systems at present, provided by the US and Germany. Since Zelenskyy made a plea for additional deliveries this spring, Germany has said it would send an additional battery, and the Netherlands announced an initiative to send another based on components supplied by multiple countries. Biden then approved the deployment of another Patriot air defence system to Ukraine last week.

The Patriot systems and their interceptor missiles have helped protect crucial government buildings and critical infrastructure in Kyiv and other cities across the country.

In at least one instance, a Patriot missile downed a Russian A-50 airborne early warning and control aircraft over the Sea of Azov in January, according to two Ukrainian officials with knowledge of the operation and Colonel Rosanna Clemente, assistant chief of staff at the US 10th Army Air and Missile Defense Command, speaking on a panel this month.

Russia has knocked out or captured more than half of Ukraine’s power generation, causing the worst rolling blackouts since its full-scale invasion in 2022. Moscow’s latest wave of missile and drone attacks has targeted Ukraine’s critical infrastructure, including thermal and hydroelectric power plants, which are much harder and more expensive to fix, rebuild or replace.

“Addressing the ammunition shortfalls and coverage gaps in Ukraine’s air defence is essential for the country to defend critical infrastructure, and no less important than stabilising the front line,” said Michael Kofman, a senior fellow in the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

“Russian strikes have significantly damaged Ukraine’s non-nuclear power generation capacity, and Russian drones are increasingly able to target Ukrainian positions behind the front lines because of a lack of air defence coverage.”

54bbf2d6d4,Newsweek,"J.D. Vance Could 'Outshine' Trump as Vice President, Ex-Aide Warns - Newsweek","Former President Donald Trump might want to avoid picking Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio as a running mate due to the potential for Vance to ""outshine"" him as vice president, according to ex-Trump aide Alyssa Farah Griffin.

Vance, who wrote the memoir Hillbilly Elegy before entering politics, has repeatedly been floated as Trump's potential VP pick, alongside names like North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. The former president told reporters on Saturday that he had already decided on his running mate but had not told anyone.

Trump also said that his choice would ""most likely"" be in attendance for his televised debate with President Joe Biden in Atlanta on Thursday, which will not have an audience. He previously hinted that he could announce his choice during next month's Republican National Convention.

Griffin, who has been an outspoken critic of the ex-president since leaving the Trump administration in its final months, warned during a Monday night appearance on CNN's The Source With Kaitlan Collins that choosing Vance could backfire on Trump.

""J.D. Vance—my fear there, or my analysis there—is that I think he could outshine Trump,"" Griffin said. ""I think he's somebody who has a big persona. And there could be real skepticism of having him in the West Wing.""

Vance expressed concerns that Trump could become ""America's Hitler"" years before becoming the former president's staunch ally while launching his political career. He told Fox News last week that Trump had ""not asked"" him to be his running mate.

Griffin said that she suspected Trump would likely choose Burgum as his running mate, although Rubio represents the greatest ""electoral"" threat to Biden's chances in November. Bookmakers have recently made the North Dakota governor a betting favorite.

""Honestly, my money's starting to lean towards Burgum,"" said Griffin. ""He's in many ways like [former Vice President] Mike Pence with a higher net worth. He's somebody who's not going to come crossways with Trump, he's somebody who's steady ... And I think that the former president genuinely likes him.""

""From an electoral standpoint, I think Marco Rubio is the scariest for the Biden-Harris team,"" she continued. ""That's somebody who could make inroads with Latinos ... For sort of Trump-skeptical Republicans—they trust him, they know him—and that could bring them back into the fold.""

Newsweek reached out for comment to Trump's office via email on Monday night.

Burgum challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination last year but dropped out of the race in December and endorsed the former president soon after.

While Burgum has said that he would have ""no concerns at all"" about serving under Trump, he has repeatedly refused to directly pitch his candidacy for vice president when asked in recent interviews.

""That's up for President Trump to decide, and President Trump alone,"" Burgum told Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum last week when asked about his potential future as Trump's running mate. ""He's got a lot of great choices.""

Trump has already ruled out running alongside former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who was his closest competitor in this year's GOP primary elections.","Two men in suits stand at a podium with microphones, one gesturing with his right hand.

d8f8c4a95b,Financial Times,Jay Powell sends mixed interest rate signal to borrowers — and Joe Biden - Financial Times,"Federal Reserve officials had bad news for Joe Biden and would-be homeowners on Wednesday — borrowing costs would not fall as soon, or as far, this year as even the central bank itself had expected in the spring.

At least that was the news, revealed on Wednesday afternoon in Washington, in the Federal Open Market Committee’s so-called dot plot, a visual display of officials’ expectations for interest rates. It was something of a surprise too.

Hours earlier, a fall in the consumer price index inflation report for May had sparked a stock market rally, as investors priced in two quarter-point cuts by year-end and put the odds on the first coming in mid-September — before the US election — at more than 80 per cent.

The dot plot said no. Price pressures remained a problem, Fed officials indicated, and the central bank would cut by just a single quarter-point this year.

Worse still — for president Biden and for borrowers — Fed officials raised their inflation forecasts, as they held rates at a 23-year high of 5.25-5.5 per cent.

If it all holds true, it means that even as other central banks around the world begin trimming rates, the Fed’s first cut may still be almost six months away — after November’s presidential election.

It is a delay that could prove consequential for Biden as he battles low approval ratings for his handling of the economy.

“By having put just one quarter point cut as the appropriate action, a move in December is perfectly understandable,” said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at Dreyfus and Mellon, and a former FOMC official. “If you’re awaiting greater confidence in disinflation, then why wouldn’t you wait until your last meeting, when you have all the data that you’re going to get for 2024?”

Yet others are less convinced. The dot plots, like market bets, have changed in recent months too — in March, officials’ forecasts were for three cuts this year. And even after Wednesday’s meeting, traders continued to price in a 64 per cent chance that the Fed would cut in mid-September.

Fed chair Jay Powell also seemed at pains in the news conference after Wednesday’s meeting to leave things more open than the dot plot suggested, saying officials’ predictions were “a very close call”.

“Fifteen of the 19 [projections] are clustered around one or two [cuts]. I would look at all of them as plausible,” he said. No one “brings to this or takes away from it a really strong commitment to a particular rate path”, he added.

Some Fed-watchers detected dissonance within the central bank’s ranks.

Krishna Guha, vice-chair at Evercore ISI, said he believed that many of the Fed’s most influential rate-setters, Powell included, were likely to have supported two cuts.

“It’s a 1.5 cut signal,” he said — leaving the decision in September, the Fed’s last meeting before the election, in play.

Powell also downplayed rate-setters’ upwards revision to their forecast for core inflation this year, from 2.6 per cent to 2.8 per cent, saying it reflected “a slight element of conservatism”.

“Do we have a high confidence that that’s right? No, it’s just a kind of conservative way for forecasting things. If we were to get more readings like today’s reading, then of course that wouldn’t be the case,” he said, referring to the softer CPI reading for May.

More “welcome” inflation data like the May CPI numbers, or signs that high borrowing costs were softening the US jobs market, could bring more cuts than the dot plots suggested on Wednesday.

Powell also picked out housing as a segment of the inflation picture the Fed would be watching, sensitive to signs that high rates were causing too much pain.

Alongside credit card debt, high mortgage rates have been especially troublesome for younger Americans trying to get on the housing ladder — and according to polls a major source of dissatisfaction.

While the White House has been reluctant to undermine the Fed’s independence and publicly call for cuts, Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren and Jacky Rosen said on Monday that high borrowing rates were driving up housing costs.

The “best thing we can do for the housing market is to bring inflation down, so that we can bring rates down”, Powell said.

The resilience of the US economy will continue to complicate that task.

Next month will mark a year since the Fed raised rates to their 23-year high range, following 500 basis points worth of increases to stem the worst bout of inflation for a generation.

It has had far less impact on the economy than some feared, and it is still not clear that inflation will keep falling or unemployment rise enough to accelerate the Fed’s rate cut schedule, or satisfy Biden’s hopes for a reduction in borrowing costs in time for the election.

On Wednesday, Powell was eager to let the data decide — leaving September open for cuts.

“I do think [the Fed] will be deliberating a lot about whether they’re looking political. But it will be at the margins,” said Blerina Uruçi, chief US economist at T Rowe Price. “If it’s very clear that [a rate cut] is what the economy needs, I don’t think they’re going to worry about the elections.”","A man in a suit stands in front of a podium with the Federal Reserve logo, with two flags behind him, one of the United States and one of the European Union, and a blurred background.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BCA9CC4C0>,2024-06-13 04:00:15.746000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/570a7565-0bcd-4a3c-ac1c-d96d7291bb23,['Politics' 'Business and Finance'],[0.9 0.8],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/d8f8c4a95b.png
ff9b4e7fa4,Global News Toronto,Hunter Biden pleads guilty to federal tax charges months after gun conviction - Global News Toronto,"Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to federal tax charges Thursday in a surprise move that spares President Joe Biden and his family another likely embarrassing and painful criminal trial of the president’s son.

Hunter Biden’s stunning decision to guilty plea to misdemeanor and felony charges without the benefits of a deal with prosecutors came hours after jury selection was supposed to begin in the case accusing him of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes.

The president’s son was already facing potential prison time after his June conviction on felony gun charges in a trial that aired unflattering and salacious details about his struggles with a crack cocaine addiction. The tax trial was expected to showcase more potentially lurid evidence as well as details about Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings, which Republicans have seized on to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt.

Although President Joe Biden’s decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential election muted the potential political implications of the tax case, the trial was expected to carry a heavy emotional toll for the president in the final months of his five-decade political career.

“Enough is enough,” defense attorney Abbe Lowell told the judge before Hunter Biden entered his plea. “Mr. Biden is prepared, because of the public and private interest, to proceed today and finish this.”

Hunter Biden quickly responded “guilty” as the judge read out each of the nine counts. The charges carry up to 17 years behind bars, but federal sentencing guidelines are likely to call for a much shorter sentence. Sentencing is set for Dec. 16.

More than 100 potential jurors had been brought to the courthouse in Los Angeles on Thursday to begin the process of picking the panel to hear the case alleging a four-year scheme to avoid paying taxes while spending wildly on things like strippers, luxury hotels and exotic cars.

Prosecutors were caught off guard when Hunter Biden’s lawyer told the judge Thursday morning that Hunter wanted to enter what’s known as an Alford plea, under which a defendant maintains their innocence but acknowledges prosecutors have enough evidence to secure a conviction.

Prosecutors said they objected to such a plea, telling the judge that Hunter Biden “is not entitled to plead guilty on special terms that apply only to him.”

“Hunter Biden is not innocent. Hunter Biden is guilty,” prosecutor Leo Wise said.

Hunter Biden walked into the courtroom holding hands with his wife, Melissa Cohen Biden, and flanked by Secret Service agents. Initially, he pleaded not guilty to the charges related to his 2016 through 2019 taxes and his attorneys had indicated they would argue he didn’t act “willfully,” or with the intention to break the law, in part because of his well-documented struggles with alcohol and drug addiction.

Hunter Biden had agreed to plead guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses last year in a deal with the Justice Department that would allow him to avoid prosecution in the gun case if he stayed out of trouble. But the agreement imploded after a judge questioned unusual aspects of it, and he was subsequently indicted in the two cases.

His decision to change his plea Thursday came after the judge issued some unfavorable pre-trial rulings for the defense, including rejecting a proposed defense expert lined up to testify about addiction.

Scarsi, who was appointed to the bench by former President Donald Trump, also placed some restrictions on what jurors would be allowed to hear about the traumatic events that Hunter Biden’s family, friends and attorneys say led to his drug addiction.

The judge barred attorneys from connecting his substance abuse struggles to the 2015 death of his brother Beau Biden from cancer or the car accident that killed his mother and sister when he was a toddler.

The indictment alleged that Hunter Biden lived lavishly while flouting the tax law, spending his cash on things like strippers and luxury hotels — “in short, everything but his taxes.”

Hunter Biden’s attorneys had asked Scarsi to also limit prosecutors from highlighting details of his expenses that they say amount to a “character assassination,” including payments made to strippers or pornographic websites. The judge has said in court papers that he will maintain “strict control” over the presentation of potentially salacious evidence.

Prosecutors had said they want to introduce evidence about Hunter Biden’s overseas dealings, which have been at the center of Republican investigations into the Biden family often seeking — without evidence— to tie the president to an alleged influence peddling scheme.

The special counsel’s team had planned to have a business associate of Hunter Biden’s testify about their work for a Romanian businessman, who prosecutors say sought to “influence U.S. government policy” while Joe Biden was vice president.

Sentencing in Hunter Biden’s Delaware conviction is set for Nov. 13. He could face up to 25 years in prison in that case, though he is likely to get far less time or avoid prison entirely.

0c7e6dfbf2,The Globe and Mail,Four bodies retrieved from inside yacht that sank off the coast of Sicily - The Globe and Mail,"Four bodies were found on Wednesday aboard the sunken wreck of a yacht belonging to the wife of British tech magnate Mike Lynch, sources close to the rescue operation said.

The identities of the victims were not immediately given by the authorities. Three of the bodies were brought ashore and taken to nearby hospitals for formal identification. The fourth corpse was being taken to land as evening set in.

Britain’s Daily Telegraph reported that two of the dead were Lynch and his 18-year-old daughter. Local authorities in Sicily declined to comment on the report.

The British-flagged Bayesian, a 56-metre-long (184-ft) superyacht was carrying 22 people and anchored off the port of Porticello when it was hit by a fierce, pre-dawn storm on Monday.

Lynch, 59, was one of the U.K.’s best-known tech entrepreneurs and had invited friends to join him on the yacht to celebrate his recent acquittal in a U.S. fraud trial.

Besides Lynch and his daughter, the other people unaccounted for after the disaster were Judy and Jonathan Bloomer, a non-executive chair of Morgan Stanley International; and Clifford Chance lawyer Chris Morvillo and his wife Neda Morvillo.

Specialist rescuers have been searching inside the hull of the sunken yacht for the past two days. The victims were believed to have been trapped in cabins, which have proved extremely hard to get to, with divers only able to stay in the vessel for 8-10 minutes before having to resurface.

Fifteen people managed to escape the yacht before it capsized in the pre-dawn tempest, while the body of the onboard chef, Canadian-Antiguan national Recaldo Thomas, was found near the wreck hours after the disaster.

The Bayesian is lying on its side at a depth of around 50 metres, apparently largely intact.

Besides the diving team, the coast guard has deployed a remotely operated vehicle to scan the seabed and take underwater pictures and videos that it said may provide “useful and timely elements” for prosecutors looking into the disaster.

What we know so far about the sinking of a luxury yacht off the coast of Sicily and those aboard

The coast guard has been questioning survivors, including the captain of the Bayesian, and passengers on the yacht that was moored next to it who witnessed the ship going down, judicial sources said.

No one is under investigation at the moment, sources added.

Experts have been at a loss to explain how a large luxury vessel, presumed to have top-class fittings and safety features, could have sunk within minutes, as recounted by witnesses. The yacht anchored next to it was unharmed by the storm.

The Bayesian, which was owned by Lynch’s wife, was built by Italian shipbuilder Perini in 2008 and last refitted in 2020. It had the world’s tallest aluminium mast, measuring 72 metres, according to its makers.

Lynch has been referred to as Britain’s Bill Gates. He built the UK’s largest software firm, Autonomy, which was sold to HP for US$11-billion in 2011, after which the deal spectacularly unravelled with the U.S. tech giant accusing him of fraud, resulting in a lengthy trial.

He was acquitted on all charges by a jury in San Francisco in June. Morvillo had represented him at the trial, while Bloomer was a character witness on his behalf.

Bayesian’s captain James Cutfield, a 51-year-old New Zealander who survived the shipwreck, was a “very good sailor” and “very well respected” in the Mediterranean, his brother Mark told The New Zealand Herald.

Matthew Schanck, chair of the Maritime Search and Rescue Council, a U.K.-based non-profit organization that trains sea rescuers, said the Bayesian was the victim of a “high impact” weather-related incident.

“If it was a water spout, which it appears to be, it’s what I would class as like a black swan event,” he told Reuters, meaning a rare and unpredictable phenomenon.","A white boat with 'CP 524 GUARDIA.

8325c01716,Financial Times,How to build a supercharged Bentley - Financial Times,"Before Formula One and Ferrari, Red Bull and multimillion-pound endorsement deals, there were the Bentley Boys. In 1923, the inaugural 24 Hours of Le Mans kicked off a spectacle that would become one of the greatest races on the motoring calendar. Manufacturers would soon sign up their factory teams to compete in the French countryside. By 1931, Alfa Romeo, Mercedes-Benz, Aston Martin and Bugatti were on the grid. But throughout the 1920s, it was all about Bentley, which won five out of the first eight races. A gallivanting group of aristocrats, adventurers and war heroes – among them the likes of Frank Clement, John Duff, Woolf Barnato and Tim Birkin – were responsible for much of Bentley’s early motor-racing success.

When they weren’t pulling all-nighters in London’s Grosvenor Square, they were obsessed with winning. Sir Henry Ralph Stanley Birkin, 3rd Baronet, was the most inventive. By 1928, halfway through a run of four consecutive Bentley victories, he came up with the idea of supercharging his 4.5-litre car. The resulting Bentley Blower became one of the most famous Bentleys ever made. It’s also, nearly a century later, Petersen Engineering’s bestselling car.

Based in a small town in Devon, Petersen has become the main destination for vintage Bentley enthusiasts. Founded by Bob Petersen and his wife Sally in 1988 as a coachbuilder and restorers, the company continues the work Birkin and WO Bentley were doing in the ’20s and ’30s. Each car is built to order, starting with a donor chassis before everything is completely overhauled. Petersen’s own archive contains many period-correct parts, but new elements are often dreamt up and manufactured from scratch. Everything, from the Connolly leather seats to the dashboards, pistons and nuts and bolts are assembled in its Devon workshops.

My dad restored this guy’s Bentley just off the cuff

Looking at a Petersen car, you might think it’s taken a lifelong dedication to Bentley to get to this point. The company was in fact founded by chance. Bob trained as a graphic designer, but his passion for tinkering was impossible to quash. The first vehicle he worked on was a double-decker London bus. His next was an old Bentley. “A local guy used to drive a vintage Bentley to the pub, but he could never get it home again as it would always break down,” says his son Jesse. “So my old man suggested he could make it more reliable by just modernising a few things. This was in the early ’80s, and he restored this guy’s Bentley just off the cuff. He then fell in love with Bentley, having not known a great deal about them before.”

Things built quickly from there and, deciding to pursue it full-time, Bob and Sally moved from High Wycombe to Devon. The majority of work is still completed on site where they live but, having expanded, Petersen now has workshops and storage in a nearby industrial estate. Bob, 70, is still heavily involved, but Jesse is now slowly taking over the reins. “In the beginning, it was just Dad on his own,” says Jesse. “Now we’ve got 16 guys that work for us full-time. Dad realises he isn’t getting any younger, but he’s still majorly in charge of things. My sister and I are partners in the business, and she does all the upholstery herself.”

Petersen has built more than 100 cars to date, with the current output being, at best, six cars a year. “We’ve had some that we’ve dragged out of orchards, and one that we pulled out of a lake in America,” says Jesse. Each one takes between 18 months and two and a half years to build, with prices starting at £350,000 and rising to £600,000 depending on the model and customisations requested. Each one is made to the client’s specifications, and nearly anything is possible – we’ve built a Mercedes ‘Trossi’ replica on a Bentley chassis before.”

In 1930 Woolf Barnato raced a train across Europe in a Bentley, which became known as the Blue Train car. “We’ve done six of those, one being supercharged.” Engines can be swapped around, and Petersen often uses later 1950s engines, which its engineers have fuel-injected to make them more reliable. And then there’s the Meteor-engined cars.

“It’s basically a Spitfire engine. Meteor engines are based on the Merlins and were used in tanks, but come without the supercharger. So we source them rather than the Spitfires, as those are about half a million just for the engine. We built one for a crazy customer up in Sunningdale. We’d already done a car for him and he said, ‘What about sticking a Meteor engine in?’ A few people had done these Meteor cars before, but this guy wanted a Bentley Blower replica with the 27-litre Meteor engine. We managed to shoehorn the engine in there somehow. It took about four years to build. After we finished the build, Top Gear found out about it and did a big show on it. Chris Evans went on to own that car. He bought that after the show and then sold it to Jay Leno.”

What about other requests? Anything particularly weird? “We’ve had a few, but nothing too dodgy. Some people want to be able to pull the carpet up and have a little lock box in there. They keep their passports in it and things like that. We built a car that went to Mexico.

d127324e65,The New York Times,"Supreme Court, for Now, Allows Louisiana Voting Map to Move Forward - The New York Times","The Supreme Court on Wednesday temporarily reinstated a congressional map in Louisiana that includes a second majority-Black district, increasing the likelihood that Democrats could gain a House seat from the state in the November election.

The move could be particularly significant in an election cycle in which the balance of power in the House is likely to be determined by a handful of races.

The order was unsigned, as is the Supreme Court’s custom in ruling on emergency applications. It came in response to a challenge to a lower-court decision that had blocked the map drawn by Louisiana’s Republican-controlled Legislature, deeming it a racial gerrymander.

The justices said that their decision would remain in effect pending an appeal or a ruling by the Supreme Court. The court’s three liberals said that they would have left the block in place. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan did not explain their reasoning, but Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, in a dissent, wrote that she believed the court had intervened too soon.

Although a majority of the justices appeared swayed by concerns about courts making changes to elections procedures close to an election, Justice Jackson wrote, she did not believe that was an issue in the case.

“There is little risk of voter confusion from a new map being imposed this far out from the November election,” she added. “In fact, we have often denied stays of redistricting orders issued as close or closer to an election.”

Justice Jackson wrote that the intense focus on the voting map was proper since “the question of how to elect representatives consistent with our shared commitment to racial equality is among the most consequential we face as a democracy.” But she said the question before the judges was “far more quotidian.”

That question, she wrote, was merely to decide when Louisiana needed a map in place for the coming election, and she pointed out that a lower federal court had determined that deadline to be early June.

The case has a long and tangled history, unfolding over more than two years of litigation and involving challenges by separate groups of voters, first under the Voting Rights Act, then under the Constitution.

In asking the Supreme Court to weigh in, Louisiana’s attorney general, Elizabeth B. Murrill, had urged the justices to act quickly.

The Louisiana secretary of state had set a deadline of May 15 to prepare for the 2024 elections, she wrote, adding that the lower-court ruling had left the state with “no congressional map.”

“Louisiana’s impossible situation in this redistricting cycle would be comical if it were not so serious,” Ms. Murrill wrote.

A group of voters, pointing to the Constitution’s equal protection clause, argued for the new map to be blocked. They contended that the map, approved by the state’s Republican-controlled Legislature after it had been directed to redraw it, “imposed a brutal racial gerrymander” on millions of voters.

The new district was a “jagged, narrow, 250-mile scar” linking majority-Black precincts in Baton Rouge and Shreveport and weaving “with surgical efficiency to encircle pockets of Black voters and exclude whites and other races,” lawyers for the plaintiffs wrote in their brief.

Ms. Murrill and a group of Black voters welcomed the court’s decision, saying it would pave the way for a fair election.

“The hope of achieving a map with two districts where Black voters can finally have fair representation has been our North Star and guiding light for years now,” said Ashley Shelton, the president of the Power Coalition for Equity and Justice, who was among the plaintiffs who had asked the justices to reinstate the new map.

Lawyers for the group of voters who sought to block the new map expressed confidence that they would eventually prevail.

“The State of Louisiana enacted a brutal racial gerrymander that segregates its voters based on their race,” the lawyers, Edward Greim and Paul Hurd, said in a statement. “Louisiana politicians passed the law at the last minute, lost in court, and then cynically ran out the clock on a replacement map.”

The dispute is part of a broader fight over voting rights that has come before the Supreme Court.

The challenge in Louisiana began after the 2020 census showed an increase in the number of Black voters. The state’s Republican-controlled Legislature drew a new map that included only one majority-Black congressional district out of six seats, igniting a court battle.

In 2022, a federal judge barred the state from using that map, finding that it probably violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

A federal appeals court upheld that ruling last year after the Supreme Court, in a surprise decision, found that Alabama had diluted the power of Black voters in drawing its voting map. In January, Louisiana lawmakers began drafting a new map for the upcoming election and approved a version that added a second district with a majority of Black voters.

Under the new map, the second district links communities in Baton Rouge, the state’s capital, in the southeastern part of the state, with Shreveport, in the state’s northwest.

A group of Louisiana voters, known in court filings as the “Callais plaintiffs,” challenged the map, arguing that it was racially gerrymandered, violating the equal protection clause.

In late April, a panel of federal judges sided with that group of voters, temporarily blocking the state from using the new map.",A 'VOTE HERE' sign is displayed in a hallway with a person walking in the background.

a663c6bcaf,USA TODAY,Joe Biden is old. So is Donald Trump. So are millions of other American workers - USA TODAY,"On Thursday night in Atlanta, President Joe Biden, 81, and presumed Republican nominee Donald Trump, 78, will become the oldest U.S. presidential candidates to ever spar in a debate.

Perhaps their collective 160 years of life experience isn’t news. Biden and Trump will be breaking the record they set in the 2020 campaign. And either would be the oldest president on Inauguration Day in January 2025.

What might make news are the questions a CNN moderator or others may raise in months ahead about Biden's or Trump's capacity to lead because of their ages.

Trump's VP options:Sizing up their pros and cons from J.D. Vance to Kari Lake

On Nov. 20, 2022, Biden broke new ground by becoming the first 80-year-old commander in chief, but consider how many of his and Trump’s peers also are still working.

Only about a quarter of Americans 65 and over are in the workforce, but nearly 2 million people over 75 are still working, based on estimates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The BLS projects the number of workers older than 75 could grow to 3.3 million, or 2% of the workforce, by 2032.

Maybe more significant to those in the ageism camp: CEOs who lead four of the 500 largest U.S. companies are older than both candidates, according to a Madison Trust Company analysis.

Number of older workers projected to jump by 2032

Perhaps some of these 75-year-old American workers aren't running companies and are pursuing less stressful second careers. But it's also likely some are working in the same job they have for years, and a few undoubtedly are still running organizations.

Trump with his business interests and Biden with his decades in Washington politics might be outliers. But you don't need to look too far down Pennsylvania Avenue to see 47 other elected officials who are over 75 years old:

Senate: 14 | Oldest: 90 – Chuck Grassley, R-IA

House of Representatives: 33 | Oldest: 87 – Grace Napolitano, D-CA, Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-DC, and Bill Pascrell Jr., D-NJ

From 26 to 90: Ages of the lawmakers elected to the 118th Congress

Admittedly that's not necessarily the representation that Americans say they want.

USA TODAY and Suffolk University polled 1,000 registered voters in October. The respondents overwhelmingly supported setting a maximum age limit for members of Congress, but they differed on what those limits should be.

Is Biden or Trump the best fit for the job?

Yes, the elephant and, er, the donkey in the room are the gaffs – real and concocted. Those on either side of the aisle have promoted and replayed videos, suggesting either Trump or Biden might not be capable of the complexities of the office.

Maybe both aren't. Maybe both are. Should it come as a surprise if either candidate slips up during the course of the presidential marathon?

The CDC says for those over 65 years old, memory lapses are not uncommon in healthy adults. Memory changes can show up in a variety of ways. A few which might attributed to either candidate:

b736971415,Financial Times,How Harris turned the tables on Trump - Financial Times,"Using Beyoncé’s pop anthem “Freedom” as a soundtrack, Kamala Harris made her clearest pitch yet for the White House in a slick video posted to social media on Thursday.

“There are some people who think we should be a country of chaos, of fear, of hate,” the vice-president said, as images of Donald Trump flashed on the screen. “But us? We chose something different. We choose freedom.”

With around 100 days to go until November’s US presidential election, Harris’s first official campaign video allowed the vice-president to reintroduce herself to the American electorate, and previewed some of the messages that will underpin her nascent campaign.

But it also laid bare the stark choice that Americans will face when they head to the ballot box in November.

Last week, the majority of US voters were dreading a rerun of the 2020 election that pitted the current and former president — two ageing white men — against each other. Now voters are being presented with a much sharper set of contrasts that cut across generations, gender and race.

While the Republicans will seek to frame Harris as a dangerous radical, Democrats will highlight the distinction between a 59-year-old one-time prosecutor and a 78-year-old former president who this year was found guilty by a jury of 34 criminal charges.

A Democratic establishment that was despondent in recent weeks is now elated at the possibility of elevating the first female president, the first Asian-American president and only the second Black president in US history.

Harris’s late entry into the race this week has shaken up an already historic US presidential contest. Joe Biden’s decision last weekend to suspend his re-election campaign and endorse his vice-president as his successor so deep into an election year is virtually unprecedented in modern political history. The last time a US president decided to forgo running for a second term was Lyndon B Johnson in March of 1968.

At the same time, Biden’s momentous choice to step aside came just one week after Trump narrowly survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The last time a current or former US president had been shot was Ronald Reagan in 1981.

“There are decades when nothing happens, and days when decades happen,” says Bob Shrum, a professor at the University of Southern California and veteran of Democratic presidential campaigns. “We are living through the days when decades happen.”

The tumult of the past few weeks makes analysts and forecasters wary of drawing any snap conclusions about what Harris’s candidacy could mean for November’s election result.

“There is no good historical precedent for what is happening right now,” says Kyle Kondik of the non-partisan University of Virginia Center for Politics. “We are flying blind.”

But Harris’s bid for the White House has undeniably injected energy and enthusiasm into a Democratic party that for weeks was plagued by infighting over Biden’s age, fitness for office and plummeting poll numbers. In the first four days of her campaign alone, she raked in more than $126mn in campaign contributions and signed up more than 100,000 new volunteers.

Even the most exuberant Democrats acknowledge Harris faces a steep climb if she is to defeat Trump in November, in part because she has long suffered relatively low approval ratings — the latest Real Clear Politics average shows just 39 per cent of Americans approve of the job she is doing as vice-president. Trump has for months led in nationwide opinion polls, which tilted even more in his favour after Biden’s disastrous showing in the televised debate last month and the attempt on Trump’s life.

Yet surveys conducted this week suggest Harris is already performing better than Biden, narrowing Trump’s lead to within the margin of error. A New York Times/Siena College poll out on Thursday showed Harris trailing Trump by just one point, 48-47, among likely voters — a virtual tie. Earlier this month, in the aftermath of the debate performance that ultimately led to Biden’s downfall, the president trailed Trump by an eye-watering six points.

“Democrats needed a boost of optimism, and they got one,” says Kondik, adding: “[They] turned death into a fighting chance to live.”

Harris faces several significant political tests on the horizon, starting with the selection of a running mate, a decision that could come as soon as next week. The vice-president is reportedly vetting several possible partners, including Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and several Democratic governors, namely Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro, North Carolina’s Roy Cooper and Andy Beshear of Kentucky.

In mid-August, she will take centre stage and formally accept the Democratic nomination for president at the party’s national convention in Chicago.

And in September, she could face Trump on the debate stage, although the two campaigns are feuding over the date, moderators and format.

In the meantime, Harris faces a more immediate challenge: defining herself and her candidacy for the American public.

“The vice-presidency is an important office, but it is not the most visible office in the country,” notes Charles Franklin, a veteran pollster and director of the Marquette Law School Poll. “This is an opportunity for her to reintroduce herself to voters.”

“We have a candidate who is well known in terms of her name identification, but she is not really very well defined,” Amy Walter, editor-in-chief of the Cook Political Report, said at an event this week at the University of Chicago Institute for Politics.

“She can deliver the message certainly much better than Biden did,” Walter added. “But how credible is she as a messenger? That is the real thing that will be tested.”

So far, Harris has echoed Biden’s arguments, albeit with a sharper message. Her pitch to voters has been largely focused on making the case against Trump, and depicting herself and the Democratic party as the guardians of liberty, especially when it comes to abortion.

The issue of reproductive rights has proved to be an election winner for the Democrats since the US Supreme Court struck down the constitutional right to an abortion in 2022.

But party insiders believe Harris will be a more effective champion of reproductive rights than Biden, an observant Catholic who earlier in his career favoured more restrictions on access to abortions.

While Trump has tried to moderate his position on the issue, Democrats are also likely to highlight the record of JD Vance, his running mate, who in the past has supported a national ban on terminations and opposed exceptions in the case of rape or incest.

Harris has largely inherited the Biden campaign apparatus and said this week that she would keep Jen O’Malley Dillon, the architect of Biden’s successful 2020 campaign, as chair of her own run for the White House.

One of the many problems that had been facing Biden’s campaign was Trump’s growing support among Black and Latino voters. In a memo this week O’Malley Dillon insisted that Harris, the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, would be able to galvanise support from Black voters, Latino voters, Asian-American voters and women voters in particular.

If the Republicans do their job and define her as being a radical Democrat, she will come back to Earth and sink like cement in water

“This campaign will be close, it will be hard fought, but Vice-President Harris is in a position of strength — and she’s going to win,” O’Malley Dillon wrote.

The other contrast to Trump the Democrats are looking to highlight is her law and order background. In remarks to campaign staffers on Monday, Harris made clear that she would be leaning on her credentials as a San Francisco prosecutor, and later attorney-general of California, to go after Trump.

“In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds: predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain,” Harris said, in what has become a fixture of her stump speech. “So, hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump’s type.”

Trump and the Republicans have also wasted no time in going after Harris, whom they have sought to paint as a dangerously leftwing Democrat whose politics are out of step with the mainstream. Many have pointed to a 2019 ranking from GovTrack, a firm that tracks congressional voting records, that named Harris the “most liberal” US senator.

“I really believe she’s a San Francisco radical. She’s actually, I think, a much worse, in a way, a much worse candidate than [Biden],” Trump told Fox News on Thursday. “She also wants to defund the police, and she really wants to do it more than any other person. She’s the most radical person probably that we’ve had in office, let alone the office of the presidency.”

Republican pollster Whit Ayres says that “the way they run against her is as a San Francisco liberal” who once held positions on energy and healthcare “that are way to the left of most Americans”. He adds: “Their least effective message is to go after her race and gender . . . That is going to blow up in their face. It is totally unnecessary.”

Trump and his allies have also sought to blame Harris for inflation and the influx of migrants at the US-Mexico border, two of Biden’s biggest political vulnerabilities.

“If the Republicans do their job and define her as being a radical Democrat and tie her to Joe Biden’s record . . . she will come back to Earth and sink like cement in water sometime after Labor Day,” says Florida Republican strategist Ford O’Connell, in reference to the US bank holiday at the start of September. “The Democrats are trying to rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic, and at the rate things are going, it will still be the same outcome.”

Harris ran for president once before, in a Democratic primary bid that began with great expectations at the start of 2019, but fizzled before the year was done. The then US senator dropped out of the race two months before the 2020 Iowa caucuses amid middling poll numbers, a cash crunch and an inability to make a compelling case for her candidacy.

But Democrats insist Harris has learnt the lessons from that campaign, when her history as a “tough on crime” prosecutor worked against her as she tried to win over progressive Democratic voters. As a general election candidate this time around, Harris needs to win over moderates in the middle — and allies insist she has grown as a communicator and a candidate during her time in the Biden administration.

“Harris gave an extraordinary speech when she announced her run for president in 2019. But she never had a message,” recalls Shrum. “That is not a problem now. The message is about what is wrong with Trump, and about how she is fighting for people.”

8a32ccc79a,CNN,Supreme Court prepares to issue ruling on Trump immunity and final cases Monday - CNN,"The Supreme Court is expected to hand down its final opinions of the term on Monday morning, resolving the question of whether former President Donald Trump may claim immunity from federal election subversion charges.

Overstepping their unofficial end-of-June deadline by a single day, the nine justices will assemble on the bench for a final time before rising for their summer recess – likely leaving in their wake a flurry of legal wrangling over their last decisions.

By far, the case of greatest consequence that is still outstanding is the question of whether Trump is entitled to the sweeping immunity he is seeking from special counsel Jack Smith’s election subversion charges.

Trump has argued that without immunity, presidents would be hamstrung in office, always fearful of being second-guessed by a zealous prosecutor after leaving the White House. That position appeared to have some purchase on the 6-3 conservative Supreme Court during oral arguments in April.

The answer to the question could have profound implications for both Trump and future presidents. During the CNN debate on Thursday, Trump claimed President Joe Biden “could be a convicted felon with all of the things that he’s done.” That answer came in response to a question from CNN’s Jake Tapper about whether Trump would seek retribution from his political opponents. Trump first responded by saying his “retribution is going to be success,” but then launched into a series of accusations against Biden.

The immunity case appears likely to come down to whether Trump’s post-election actions were “official” – that is, steps pursuant to his presidential duties – or whether they were “private,” which would not likely receive immunity.

The court will also decide two cases at the intersection of the First Amendment and social media. At issue are laws enacted in Florida and Texas aimed at stopping social media giants like Facebook and X from throttling conservative views. The state laws ban online platforms from removing or demoting posts that express opinions, such as political content.

The Republican governors who signed the laws said they were needed to keep the social media platforms from discriminating against conservatives.

In some ways, the underlying dispute isn’t as salient as it might have been when the cases were first filed. Since Elon Musk bought X and changed the company’s content moderation policies, conservatives have been less likely to accuse the social media giant of throttling their views. But the case nevertheless raised fundamental First Amendment questions that could have a broad impact.

At the center of both disputes is whether the curation of posts is protected speech – in the same way that news outlets are entitled to First Amendment protection in how they design their front pages or guest lineups – or whether the social media platforms are simply carrying third-party posts to readers in a way that would allow the government to regulate them more closely.

A final case to be decided deals with a North Dakota truck stop that is challenging the fees banks can charge for debit card transactions in a ruling that could have deeper implications for other government regulations. The issue before the Supreme Court is whether the truck stop may sue in the first place, given a six-year statute of limitations on challenging government regulations.

It’s a technical question but with potentially important ramifications. The federal government has warned that if the court sides with the truck stop, it could open the floodgates for similar challenges to government rules.

The decisions will cap a term in which the high court has largely ducked the underlying questions of two major abortion matters. It has sided with the Biden administration on one gun regulation and tossed out a federal ban on bump stocks in another. On Friday, the court narrowed a charge prosecutors had filed against hundreds of people who took part in the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.

Beyond the decisions, the court’s term was also plagued by controversy off the bench, including a series of stories documenting that controversial flags – including an upside-down US flag – had flown at properties owned by Justice Samuel Alito. An activist who represented herself as a religious conservative at a Supreme Court event released secret recordings of Alito and his wife, as well as Chief Justice John Roberts, discussing a range of politically sensitive topics.",The Supreme Court building is visible with a vehicle parked in front and a fence in the foreground.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA4FE7100>,2024-07-01 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/01/politics/final-rulings-supreme-court/index.html,['Politics' 'National' 'Other'],[0.95 0.85 0.75],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/8a32ccc79a.png
cb16355efd,The New York Times,Opinion | The Tiniest Words Generate the Biggest Uproar - The New York Times,"As a linguist, I pay close attention to debates about language. But I won’t be telling you anything you don’t already know when I say that in recent years pronouns have become a subject of intense interest for reasons that have nothing to do with grammar. Across the country, debates rage about the effects of letting people decide whether to be called “he,” “she,” “they” or anything else they choose.

My own opinion on the matter makes no sense whatsoever — at least not the opinion that A.I. recently attributed to me. I checked the other day after seeing a social media post that described me as not approving of trans people. Figuring maybe something I wrote about gender-neutral pronouns had gotten lost in translation, I searched and got this: “He found the use of ‘they’ to replace gender-specific pronouns to be clumsy, disruptive, and unnecessary, and that it could sometimes reduce clarity. McWhorter also suggested other gender-neutral pronouns, including ‘que, ‘s/he, and ‘one.’”

Hmm, not a word of that is true. I wouldn’t be caught dead endorsing the ungainly, unpronounceable “s/he” or the hopelessly wooden “one,” and God knows what “que” is.

In reality, I am very much in favor of the new prevalence of gender-neutral pronominal usage. As conceptions of gender become more fluid, we need a pronoun that allows for more possibility. Plus, “they” had already been used in a singular, gender-neutral way (“Each student has an hour to complete their test”) for several centuries. Shakespeare did it in “The Comedy of Errors”: “There’s not a man I meet but doth salute me / As if I were their well-acquainted friend.” Many sticklers consider it incorrect, but it is native to casual speech (including, I suspect, that of many of the sticklers).

The most heated arguments about gender-neutral pronouns, however, render a different objection: They claim that allowing people to choose their own pronouns is a gateway to things like gender-affirming surgery, gender-neutral bathrooms and trans women on women’s sports teams. People who regard such things as dangerous write me to tell me this all the time.

I’m not here to engage in a debate about those outcomes, and I’ll leave biology to the experts. But this idea — that pronouns can encourage people to become trans — reflects a grave misunderstanding of how language works.

You can see what I mean if you look at other cultures. Gender in the Thai language is entirely binary — “he” and “she” — yet the people known as kathoey, sometimes described as a third sex, have an established place in Thai culture. In fact, the five countries that U.C.L.A.’s Williams Institute has determined to be the most accepting of L.G.B.T.I. people speak languages that distinguish “he” from “she.” On the other hand, spoken Mandarin Chinese has only nongendered pronouns, yet China has no high-profile transgender community.

The lesson from these other languages applies to English, too: New pronouns arise in the wake of new identities. They are not the causes of new identities.

In the English language, gender works in idiosyncratic ways. Its third-person singular pronouns are gendered, but its nouns and verbs do not get assigned to random genders the way they do in so many other languages. The way that plays out can be fascinating to witness. Especially when it’s in flux, which language always is.

“They” is but one facet of a broader current trend toward gender neutrality. Think about how ordinary it is to hear English-speaking women address one another as “dude” and “you guys,” with no specific masculine meaning intended. A great many other languages are creating gender-neutral pronouns: French has combined “il” and “elle” into “iel,” and Portuguese’s “elu” is so pretty, I wish we could use it just because. Languages in the Balkans region, such as Bulgarian and Romanian, are also experimenting with gender-neutral options.

Meanwhile, in English language slang, people gender objects as if the language were Spanish or German, with things being marked as “she” to convey admiration, warning or judgment: of a burrito “Whoa, she’s spicy!” or of a hill “Watch out, she’s steep!” This usage, which some of my students alerted me to, began as gay slang but is becoming ever more common.

Each of these changes is sure to infuriate someone. If the sound of the singular “they” works on you like nails on a chalkboard, well, you won’t have to look far before finding someone to commiserate with. And when it comes to debates over “he” and “she” and “they,” plenty of people pile on who couldn’t care less about apostrophe placement or the order of tenses, because gender is more than grammar; it’s part of the way we see ourselves in the world. When the rules change, it can seem that the ground is shifting beneath our feet.

The solution is not, however, to try to stop people from using pronouns in new ways. That effort will never achieve what the sticklers want it to. It can’t stop social change, but perhaps more to the point, it can’t even stop linguistic change. People, in the end, are going to talk more or less the way they want to, and poxes on what to say will only spark ways to get around it. I’d rather take an interest in the possibilities of the new than scowl about the loss of the old and the familiar.

Of course, another person might see things differently, and that’s … their prerogative.","Fig 1. They/Them and Fig 2.

Philip Sellinger, now the US attorney for the District of New Jersey, said that in late 2020, he went to Menendez hoping for the senator’s support in his bid to be nominated to the post. During the conversation, Sellinger testified, Menendez mentioned that Fred Daibes, a New Jersey real estate developer and co-defendant in the case, “was being treated unfairly” by prosecutors who had indicted him on bank fraud charges.

“Sen. Menendez hoped that if I became US attorney, that I would look at (the Daibes case) carefully,” Sellinger said.

That testimony came up again Tuesday when Menendez attorney Avi Weitzman pressed Sellinger on the nature of that interaction.

“I did not believe that (Menendez) was asking me to do anything other than my official duty,” Sellinger, a longtime friend and political supporter of Menendez, told the court. “I didn’t believe he was asking me to do anything.”

At that, Weitzman asked Sellinger if it was “fair to say that he didn’t ask you to put your thumb on the scales of justice?”

Sellinger nodded in agreement.

Now in its sixth week, the trial has shifted its focus from allegations that Menendez, along with his wife, Nadine, accepted bribes from a New Jersey businessman to charges that the senator was part of a corrupt deal involving Daibes and the government of Qatar.

The trial resumed Tuesday following a three-day delay after Daibes tested positive for Covid-19 last week.

The Menendezes, Daibes and Egyptian American businessman Wael Hana are accused of engineering a complex and multifaceted bribery scheme. All four have pleaded not guilty.

Nadine Menendez will be tried separately this summer. A fifth alleged co-conspirator, Jose Uribe, pleaded guilty and testified for the government as a cooperating witness.

Sellinger was not initially recommended by Bob Menendez for the US attorney nomination, a decision prosecutors suggest was tied to his unwillingness to entertain the senator’s concerns about the Daibes case. Sellinger testified last week that he told Menendez he would have to recuse himself from any issues relating to Daibes because of a past legal entanglement with the developer.

Former Menendez adviser Michael Soliman described the behind-the-scenes push for an alternative to Sellinger in his testimony Tuesday. Ultimately, Soliman said, Menendez decided to recommend then-Hudson County Prosecutor Esther Suarez to the White House. But that choice faced harsh and immediate blowback centered on Suarez’s handling of a rape accusation a volunteer for Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy’s 2017 campaign made against Murphy staffer Al Alvarez. Suarez did not bring charges against Alvarez, whom she had known for more than a decade.

A subsequent probe by then-New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal found that Suarez had not acted inappropriately. (Grewal testified earlier in the trial that Menendez tried to meddle in a separate case, although he too said under cross-examination that the senator did not ask him to put his thumb on the scales of justice.)

Soliman described to the court in excruciating detail his work to fend off critical press reports about Suarez and manage the public perception of Menendez, who was coming under fire for backing her. After a few ham-handed attempts by Suarez to defend herself to local media outlets and, eventually, the Biden administration’s refusal to nominate her, Solimon said he and Menendez went searching for a “Plan B.”

Around that point, in the spring or summer of 2021, Solimon said he had another conversation with Sellinger. This time, Sellinger told Solimon that he would not, after all, need to recuse himself from the Daibes case if he was nominated and confirmed. Sellinger, though, was having difficulty getting an audience with Menendez, so he passed the message along to Solimon, he testified.

“If you call Sellinger,” Solimon said he told Menendez after the meeting, “you’ll be comfortable with what he says.”

With Suarez’s chances sunk, Menendez recommended Sellinger for the job he had wanted all along. The White House nominated Sellinger, who was confirmed and took office in December 2021. But in an about-face, Sellinger did recuse himself from the Daibes case.

Solimon told the court that Menendez asked him to find out why Sellinger changed his mind, describing the senator as “inquisitive” and “confused” but not angry when told of the decision. Solimon told Menendez he would contact Sellinger, he testified, but never did.

Sellinger and Solimon would, however, eventually get together for a meal. But before they could sit down, Solimon recalled, Sellinger warned him against bringing up any specific, ongoing criminal case, telling him he would have to report anything of the sort to the Justice Department. Solimon said he never raised the Daibes case.

Menendez, after being told about the interaction, expressed some regret, Solimon said.

“I’m sorry you had to go through that,” he told his close aide, then dropped it.

Menendez, though, remained frosty toward Sellinger, who testified that the senator rejected an invitation to his investiture ceremony.

“I’m going to pass,” Menendez said, according to Sellinger, adding: “The only thing worse than not having a relationship with the United States attorney is people thinking you have a relationship with the United States attorney – and you don’t.”

Prosecutors said in court Tuesday morning that they plan to rest their case on June 25. Defense lawyers said they hope to rest their case in time for the jury to be charged by the week of July 8.

e8890600d3,The Globe and Mail,"KC vets report to training camp, where the rookies are already trying to make an impact - The Globe and Mail","Kansas City knows exactly what it has returning from last season.

It is quite familiar with how much tight end Travis Kelce means to the offence. And it knows that its defence, which allowed the second-fewest points in the NFL last season, returns mostly intact after shutting down San Francisco in their latest Super Bowl triumph.

So as veterans reported to training camp Friday at Missouri Western State University, the reality for Kansas City might be this: Its chances of a record third straight Lombardi Trophy could hinge on players that are new this season.

Specifically the rookies, who reported to camp Tuesday for a few extra days of work before the veterans arrived.

“There’s no easing,” Mahomes said of the first-year players. “It’s time to go now.”

Like most general managers, Brett Veach often preaches about taking “the best player available” during the NFL draft, and if that was the case, KC was mighty fortunate in April. The players it selected also filled some of their biggest needs on both sides of the ball, and they are being counted to step into important roles almost immediately.

Tops on the list is Xavier Worthy, the fleet-footed wide receiver out of Texas, who broke the record in the 40-yard dash at the scouting combine but was slowed throughout voluntary summer workouts by a nagging hamstring injury.

Worthy pronounced himself ready to go this week, and he has been getting plenty of reps with a compression wrap on his still-recovering hamstring. That is good news for Kansas City, which plans to use his game-breaking speed to stretch defences down the field in a way that Mahomes has not been able since Tyreek Hill was running routes for him.

“I definitely feel like there’s no time to ease in. I mean, it’s all go,” Worthy said. “Once you’re here, you’re here. I understand what Pat’s saying, and just to build that connection with him is going to be key here.”

KC may not know just how important that will be for a while.

As it stands, Worthy is expected to line up as the No. 3 wide receiver alongside second-year pro Rashee Rice and Marquise Brown, one of Kansas City’s big-name free-agent acquisitions. But with legal trouble hanging over Rice stemming from a car crash in Dallas, and a potential NFL suspension to go with it, KC might be playing without him at some point this season.

That would mean more pressure on Worthy to produce.

Kansas City is much deeper at the position than it was last season, when it was the team’s biggest weakness. But backups such as Mecole Hardman, Justin Watson and Kadarius Toney do not offer the same kind of big-play upside of the three starters.

The other big hole for KC is at left tackle, where they let penalty-prone Donovan Smith hit free agency. While competition could last much of training camp, the front-runner to start appears to be second-round draft pick Kingsley Suamataia.

His biggest obstacle is Wanya Morris, who showed some positive signs as a rookie last season.

“I’ve known Wanya as a player. He’s a great guy. He’s friends with a lot of guys that I know,” Suamataia said. “We are boys on and off the field, just trying to gain that job. We’re both just working hard, the best that we can, and whoever comes out on the top – we’re still boys, but it’s business out here.”

While KC returns a slew of veterans, and that means precious few competitions for jobs, there are a couple of spots where rookies could work their way into the mix before the opener against Baltimore on Sept. 5.

Fourth-round pick Jared Wiley could give Kelce a break at tight end. Another fourth-rounder, Jaden Hicks, has a shot at backing up the safety positions. Fifth-round pick Hunter Nourzad could earn time at both centre and guard. And defensive back Kamal Hadden could soak up some of the snaps at cornerback that left with L’Jarius Sneed for Tennessee.

“The vets have been extremely helpful in everything since the rookies have gotten here,” Nourzad said. “Not just football stuff, but personal stuff – stuff about Kansas City, including us in stuff they do when it comes to charity and stuff like that.

“Everybody, all the older vets, have just been such a great resource for all of us.”",A football player in a red uniform with the number 1 is walking on a grassy field with a path in the foreground.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6B7D99E5C0>,2024-07-19 23:12:42.668000+00:00,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/football/article-kc-vets-report-to-training-camp-where-the-rookies-are-already-trying/,['Sports' 'Local/Regional'],[0.95 0.75],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/e8890600d3.png
f0c6df5637,Financial Times,"Alma Mater, Almeida Theatre review — culture wars flare up in college harassment drama - Financial Times","Jo was in Nikki’s position once. As a student in the 1980s, Jo was an ardent feminist, a firebrand campaigner, one of the first women to study at her prestigious college. She opens Kendall Feaver’s new play by reading aloud some of the choice insults with which the male students “welcomed” her and her peers.

Now, still pioneering, Jo has returned to the same college as the first “female master” (the title itself feels revealing). So when Nikki, an earnest third-year undergraduate, turns up in her office with a complaint about male students studying online photos of freshers to select the hottest, you might expect action.

But Jo is a pragmatist. This is small beer, she reckons, compared with the huge struggles of earlier feminists. She advises Nikki to select her battles more judiciously, to go and relax. Then Paige, a female fresher, is raped. Paige doesn’t want to report the assault, which leaves Jo unable to act within the rules and Nikki determined to take action somehow. The stage is set for a messy and heated confrontation

Feaver dives headfirst into the current culture wars. The arguments rage back and forth. Should Jo have acted straight away? Was Paige the victim of “rape culture” at the university? What is it about current society that makes her still feel, shockingly, that she is somehow to blame? Should Nikki press on with action anyway, given Paige’s reluctance to talk? What happens to all the individuals involved once the story gets into the public domain?

Feaver’s play, like Robert Icke’s The Doctor before it, turns the Almeida stage into a cauldron of debate. Alma Mater is not quite as subtle as that play, but it’s still gripping, uncomfortable and fiercely topical, examining how microaggressions are linked to more serious assaults, each twist adding another layer of complexity.

Polly Findlay’s production emphasises its gladiatorial nature, delivered on a bare stage surrounded by benches (design by Vicki Mortimer) and led by two blazing performances. Justine Mitchell, who took over the part at short notice because of ill health, is excellent as Jo: funny, sharp, brusque. We see the fierce intelligence and tough, fighting spirit that have driven her forward, but we also see how that has hardened into intransigence. Opposite her, Phoebe Campbell’s Nikki is similarly determined, brimming with anger and passion but, as Campbell subtly brings out, also struggling with pain.

There’s lovely work too from Liv Hill as Paige, a young woman forced into an impossible position, and from Nathalie Armin and Nathaniel Parker as Jo’s colleagues caught up in the whirlpool. It’s not a perfect play — it is too schematic in places — but it’s a compelling, sharply resonant ethical workout.

6287a0c672,Financial Times,Yorkshire Water boss receives £1mn as bonus ban announced - Financial Times,"Yorkshire Water has handed its chief executive a £1.03mn pay package despite leaving thousands of households with disrupted water supplies for a fortnight and “severe” sewage pollution failures.

Nicola Shaw, the chief executive of the water utility, received a base salary of £585,000 and a total pay package of £1.03mn — including a £371,000 bonus; 42.2 per cent of the maximum allowed — according to the 2023-2024 annual report published this week.

Last year Shaw did not receive a bonus and took home £718,000 for the 10-month period, after joining in May 2022.

The payout comes after Yorkshire Water, which serves 5mn households in the north of England, was rapped by the regulator in April after a burst water pipe seriously limited water supply for a fortnight late last year.

Ofwat said 12,700 households were affected with customers left struggling “to go about their daily lives”, and the regional monopoly failing to provide adequate support such as bottled water.

The new Labour government meanwhile laid out plans during Wednesday’s King’s Speech to make bosses of water companies face personal criminal liability for breaking laws on water quality. The bill will also give new powers to Ofwat to ban bonuses if environmental standards are not met.

Yorkshire Water said in its annual report that the board “recognises that the business did not achieve the level of performance required”, and that there were a number of “serious pollution events”.

According to Environment Agency data, it was the second-worst company for sewage spills last year and received a downgrade in its environmental performance rating, from three to two stars.

Shaw, a former chief executive of the HS1 high-speed railway line, will also receive undisclosed pay from her roles at Kelda Holdings, Yorkshire Water’s Jersey-registered parent company. She also holds an additional role as non-executive director at International Airlines Group.

Kate Bayliss, an academic and water expert at the University of London Soas, said water companies are “clearly not reading the room, given the public outrage at their performance, especially when these pay packages are funded by customer bills and there is a cost of living crisis”.

“There is clearly no evidence that higher CEO salaries lead to better performance when it comes to environmental and social outcomes,” she added.

Ofwat has provisionally agreed a 25 per cent increase in bills for customers of Yorkshire Water, which would see households pay £537 a year by 2030, up from the current £430. A final decision will be made by December as part of the regulator’s five-year settlement with water companies.

Yorkshire Water paid £84.1mn in dividends within the group structure, up from £62.3mn over the previous 12 months.

The company said its “ultimate shareholders have not received a dividend for the last eight years”. Its owners include Singaporean wealth fund GIC, Corsair Infrastructure Management, DWS and SAS Trustee Corporation.

Other water companies have also paid out bonuses. Thames Water awarded its new chief executive Chris Weston a £195,000 bonus and total pay of £437,00 for the three months to the end of March.

Severn Trent chief executive Liv Garfield received a £584,000 bonus and total pay of £3.2mn in the year to the end of March, while Southern Water chief executive Lawrence Gosden received a £183,000 bonus for the year to March 31, increasing his total pay for the year to £764,000.

Yorkshire Water said its bonus scheme takes into account “customer service and environmental measures, as well as considering the wider performance of the business in the round.”

176303d96b,CBS News,"Ohio voters approve amendment to establish right to abortion in state constitution, CBS News projects - CBS News","Washington — Ohio voters have approved a ballot measure to amend the state constitution to establish a right to abortion, CBS News projects, delivering a crucial victory for abortion rights and adding momentum behind efforts to protect abortion access through citizen-led initiatives in the wake of the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade.

The projected success of the ballot initiative in the red state of Ohio is likely to buoy Democrats' hopes that reproductive rights will continue to be a salient issue for voters nearly 17 months after the Supreme Court's decision rolling back the constitutional right to abortion. Voters' approval of the measure Tuesday, which is known as Issue 1, extends the winning streak for abortion rights proponents, who saw success in all six states where abortion-related measures were on the ballot last year.

With 99% of the vote in, the measure was passing by a margin of 56.6% to 43.4%.

The proposal to enshrine abortion access in the Ohio Constitution was the only one involving reproductive rights directly before voters this election and the first in which voters in a Republican-controlled state were asked to affirmatively guarantee the right to an abortion in the state's founding document.

In a statement released Tuesday night, President Biden celebrated the results and reiterated that his administration will work to protect access to reproductive health care. The president again called on Congress to codify the right to abortion in federal law.

""Ohioans and voters across the country rejected attempts by MAGA Republican elected officials to impose extreme abortion bans that put the health and lives of women in jeopardy, force women to travel hundreds of miles for care, and threaten to criminalize doctors and nurses for providing the health care that their patients need and that they are trained to provide,"" Mr. Biden said. ""This extreme and dangerous agenda is out-of-step with the vast majority of Americans.""

Abortion-rights advocates also cheered the ballot initiative's approval as a victory for reproductive freedom.

""This election, Ohioans chose hope. They chose a future for Ohio where people have control of their own bodies and lives, without government interference. And they did so even in the face of state officials — from the governor's office down — spouting lies, purging the voter rolls, and meddling in the fairness of this election,"" Alexis McGill Johnson, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement.

After the Supreme Court overturned Roe, Ohio was one of several states where abortion rights advocates looked to citizen-driven ballot initiatives to protect abortion rights after stringent restrictions were allowed to take effect. Efforts are already underway in several more states, including Florida and Arizona, to put access to abortion directly before voters in the 2024 election.

The question before voters in Ohio was whether to amend the state constitution to create an individual right to reproductive freedom, which includes decisions on abortion. A majority ""yes"" vote was needed for the ballot measure to pass.

A CBS News poll conducted before Election Day found that 57% of Americans believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, compared to 42% who think it should be illegal. Additionally, 74% of Americans are concerned that pregnant women may be more at risk in states with restrictions on abortion, 60% are worried about hospitals and maternity care centers closing, and 52% are concerned about doctors leaving those states.

What is Issue 1?

Issue 1 was a ballot measure to change the Ohio Constitution to include protections for abortion access. According to ballot language, the measure would establish in the state constitution ""an individual right to one's own reproductive medical treatment,"" including to make decisions on abortion, contraception, fertility treatment, continuing one's own pregnancy and miscarriage care.

The amendment, titled ""The Right to Reproductive Freedom with Protections for Health and Safety,"" protects any person or entity that helps a patient receive reproductive medical treatment and prohibit Ohio from ""directly or indirectly burdening, penalizing or prohibiting abortion"" before viability, generally considered to be between 22 and 24 weeks of pregnancy.

The proposal allows the state to ban abortion after viability, except when it is considered necessary to protect the life and health of the mother. Fetal viability is defined in the amendment as ""the point in a pregnancy when, in the professional judgment of the pregnant patient's treating physician, the fetus has a significant likelihood of survival outside the uterus with reasonable measures.""

Under the measure, the patient's physician is granted the authority to determine ""on a case-by-case basis,"" whether the fetus is viable.

Abortions would be allowed at any stage of pregnancy if necessary to protect the life or health of the mother.

How did Issue 1 get on the ballot?

Abortion rights advocates began their effort to put the issue directly before voters after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022. Months later, Kansas voters rejected a proposed constitutional amendment that would've affirmed there is no right to abortion under the state constitution.

The abortion rights position succeeded in five other states where the issue was directly on the ballot: In California, Michigan and Vermont, voters approved measures to enshrine abortion access in their state constitutions, and in Kentucky and Montana, proposals to restrict abortion rights failed to win the necessary support.

The outcomes in red states like Kansas, Kentucky and Montana buoyed efforts by abortion rights supporters to pursue ballot measures in states like Ohio, where the group Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights submitted its proposed amendment to establish a constitutional right to abortion in February.

The group collected and submitted more than 700,000 signatures in July, of which nearly 496,000 were deemed valid by Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, more than the roughly 413,000 needed to put the proposed amendment before voters.

Ohio's five-member ballot board adopted language for the ballot measure in August, but it was challenged in state court by Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, which argued the board's approved language sought to improperly mislead Ohio voters and persuade them to oppose the proposed constitutional amendment.

The board made changes including adding the term ""unborn child"" to the ballot language, even though the phrase does not appear in the amendment itself.

The Ohio Supreme Court in September ordered the state ballot board to rewrite one element of the language — involving the phrase ""citizens of the state"" — and left the rest in place, including the use of ""unborn child"" instead of ""fetus.""

How many votes were required for Issue 1 to pass?

Support from a majority — 50% plus one vote — was needed for Issue 1 to pass. The amendment will take effect 30 days after the election.

Ohio Republicans attempted earlier this year to raise the threshold for approving changes to the state constitution, which would've made doing so more difficult. Under the measure put to voters during a special election held in August, also called Issue 1, any proposed constitutional amendment would've required approval from at least 60% of voters, a supermajority.

But Ohio voters definitively rejected the ballot measure, with 57.1% voting ""no."" The outcome of the special election held Aug. 8 meant that the state's simple-majority bar, in place since 1912, would remain.

What was the argument in favor of Issue 1?

Proponents of abortion rights argued that a ""yes"" on Issue 1 is a vote for reproductive freedom and ""to keep government out of our family's personal decisions.""

In an issue guide provided by the Ohio secretary of state's office, advocates of the amendment said that a ""yes"" vote ensures Ohioans can make decisions ""that are best for them and their families"" regarding contraception and abortion and protects patients from ""extreme"" abortion bans. They warned that if the proposed amendment were rejected, abortion could be outlawed in the state, even in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother's life is at risk.

They also argued Issue 1 was backed from doctors, nurses and faith leaders, as well as voters across the political spectrum. A ""yes"" vote, the abortion rights supporters said, keeps the government from jailing patients who seek abortions or miscarriage care and doctors providing that care.

""Ohioans know that no matter how you feel about abortion personally, government should not have the power to make these personal medical decisions for the people you love,"" said members of a committee that was formed to get Issue 1 on the ballot.

In the run-up to the election, Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights has raised more than $28 million since early August.

What was the argument against Issue 1?

A trio of state Republican lawmakers argued that a vote against Issue 1 would ""save life, protect women, defend parents' rights.""

They calleid the proposed amendment a ""dangerous attack on the unborn, women and parents"" that would allow for ""abortion-on-demand"" and exclude parents from their children's medical decisions. By erasing these parental rights, a topic that has gained traction among GOP presidential candidates, the Republicans claim parents can be kept out of their child's decisions involving abortion and gender-affirming care.

""Don't enshrine late-term abortion in Ohio's Constitution. Don't erase parental rights. Don't subject women to dangerous, unregulated medical procedures,"" the lawmakers say. The amendment, though, does not mention parental rights or gender-affirmation surgery.

The Republicans claimed the proposal will lift limits on abortion to allow a pregnancy to be terminated because of the fetus' sex, race or disability and allow abortions later in pregnancy. Less than 1% of all abortions performed in 2020 occurred at or after 21 weeks gestation, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Protect Women Ohio, one of the leading groups opposing Issue 1, has raised $9.9 million since Sept. 8.

What were the abortion laws in Ohio?

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, signed a bill into law in 2019 that outlawed abortions once embryonic cardiac activity is detected, typically around six weeks of pregnancy. The law, which does not contain exceptions for rape or incest, briefly went into effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade more than a year ago, but its enforcement was blocked by state courts.

While litigation over the six-week law continued, abortions remained legal in Ohio until 22 weeks of pregnancy.","A group of people are standing behind a line of signs advocating for and against Issue #22, with a clear blue sky in the background.",<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BA27A04C0>,2023-11-06 15:16:00+00:00,https://www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/issue-1-ohio-november-2023-election-abortion/,['Politics' 'Health'],[0.95 0.9 ],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/176303d96b.png
912fe97755,The New York Times,"Man, the Last 50 Years or So Have Been a Wild Time for Statecraft - The New York Times","THE ART OF DIPLOMACY: How American Negotiators Reached Historic Agreements That Changed the World, by Stuart E. Eizenstat

When I was growing up in Catholic Ireland, books on moral and theological matters carried, near their title pages, a mark of approval from a local bishop and the phrase “nihil obstat” — a fancy Latin way of saying “all clear.” Stuart E. Eizenstat’s book on the major episodes of American diplomacy over the last half-century — from the opening of China to the invasion of Gaza — comes with nihil obstats from the secular equivalent of an entire conclave of cardinals.

It has a posthumous foreword by one former secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, and a preface by another, James A. Baker III. It carries gushing blurbs from one former U.S. president (Bill Clinton), three former prime ministers (the United Kingdom’s Tony Blair, Ireland’s Bertie Ahern and Israel’s Ehud Olmert), a galaxy of international luminaries and two further luminaries of U.S. diplomacy, Hillary Clinton and John Bolton. All of them have also been interviewed for their insights.

The improbable conjunction of those last two names — Bolton served in the administration of Donald Trump, who was, among other things, Clinton’s nemesis — is typical of “The Art of Diplomacy.” Kissinger and Baker were Republicans; Eizenstat himself served in senior positions in the Democratic administrations of Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton.

The book therefore harks back to an ideal of U.S. diplomacy as a nonpartisan arena, an essentially technocratic endeavor. Eizenstat is unhappy “when diplomacy is politicized” and he hopes to promote a “vision of bipartisan U.S. leadership.” Yet, if there was ever a time when it was possible to imagine an unpoliticized diplomacy, it is surely long gone. Eizenstat acknowledges, for example, that tackling climate change “will be a supreme test” of America’s global leadership. Whether that test is met depends utterly on which party is in power.

The folly of trying to avoid partisanship is obvious even in Kissinger’s foreword. He provides a brutal summary of his own longstanding intellectual position: In foreign policy, actions do not express “a notion of justice” but are “based on a conception of interests.” This is a false dichotomy. Any sane foreign policy must stem from an understanding that, in a radically interdependent world, global justice is also a vital national interest. The fair regulation of trade, the upholding of international laws against aggression and the abuse of human rights, the rational management of migration and saving human life on the planet are not foreign to the immediate well-being of Americans.

Those imperatives spring from collective values, which is to say from politics. It is especially odd that Eizenstat, who in addition to serving under Carter is the author of “President Carter: The White House Years,” mostly evades the obvious clash between the worldview set out by Kissinger in the foreword and that of his former boss, who insisted as president that U.S. foreign policy “is rooted in our moral values,” except to say that Carter’s election victory “signaled a shift away from Kissinger’s realpolitik.”

In a hagiographic opening chapter on Kissinger himself, Eizenstat writes that he “presided over some of the greatest triumphs of America’s foreign policy, as well as some of its tragic failures.” The triumphs — especially the opening of diplomatic relations with China and the making of peace between Egypt and Israel — are recounted in vivid and engrossing detail. The tragedies are swept under the thin carpet of an endnote: “For example, Kissinger’s support for Latin American dictators with egregious human rights policies; the massive, deadly, destabilizing bombing of Cambodia; continuing the Vietnam War,” and the “support for the Indonesian dictator Suharto’s invasion of East Timor.”

These studies are often fascinating and, based as they are on extensive interviews with participants like former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the former C.I.A. director Leon Panetta, they contain a great deal of useful research material.

By far the most interesting of them is Eizenstat’s firsthand account of his time negotiating with Swiss, German and Austrian authorities and commercial institutions to secure reparations and restitution for Holocaust survivors. In the 1990s, Eizenstat navigated pathways of compromise between “an unruly fractious group of class-action lawyers,” a “recalcitrant, unrepentant and uncooperative Swiss government” and the needs of victims. His account of these talks is animated by moral passion and gripping enough to make one wish he had written a more personal — and indeed a more political — book.

Of Eizenstat’s case studies, the one I know best is the negotiation of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which ended the long period of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles. While his description of the deal-making is broadly accurate, his grasp of the political context is weak. Discrimination against Catholics in Northern Ireland, though systematic, was emphatically not “a form of apartheid in all but name.” It is also positively insulting to suggest that John Hume’s relentlessly pacific Social Democratic and Labour Party had a “violent fringe.” (Eizenstat seems to be confusing the S.D.L.P. with the I.R.A.’s former political wing, Sinn Fein.)

Bizarrely, he further claims that Irish American politicians, including Senator Edward Kennedy, “weighed in against U.S. involvement” in the peace process. As one of his own endnotes seems to acknowledge, the precise opposite happened. Perhaps, in trying to span such a range of situations, from Vietnam and the former Yugoslavia to Angola and Afghanistan, Eizenstat has simply spread himself too thin.

He even tries to bring the book up-to-date by adding quick (and insightful) thoughts on the Gaza crisis. He appends some of them to a chapter in which he hails the success of the Trump administration’s brokerage of a package of deals between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan. This agreement (known as the Abraham Accords) has, he writes, “transformed Israel’s position in the Middle East and the future of the peace process, integrating Israel in the region for the first time.” Immediately after this, in a short section on the Hamas atrocities of Oct. 7, he writes that “Israel’s response has impeded its further integration in the region.” These terrible events make his overly optimistic conclusions about the efficacy of constricted bargains less persuasive.",An older man in a suit and tie gestures towards a woman in a black dress with a pearl necklace.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x117 at 0x7D6BA13E5F90>,2024-05-26 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/26/books/review/the-art-of-diplomacy-stuart-e-eizenstat.html,['Politics' 'International' 'Opinion/Editorial'],[0.85 0.8  0.75],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/912fe97755.png

Best Cooling Fans

Best Overall: Honeywell HYF260 Quiet Set Whole Room Tower Fan

Size: 10.4 x 9.8 x 40 inches, 10 pounds

Number of speeds: five

Honeywell has earned its reputation in the heating and cooling space for great reasons. The brand offers high quality products at a reasonable price. The Honeywell Quiet Set Tower Fan is no exception. The reason I went with it — It has more than 20,000 five-star reviews on Amazon. Customers love the slim design and near noiselessness, and I can attest that both these qualities hold true. The fan is one of the quietest I have tested at this price-point. It may not have as many power levels as the more expensive options, but the highest setting did provide enough air to cool down my entire living room in five to ten minutes. I was very satisfied with this fan, and for anyone who wants something reliable and durable, I suggest starting with Honeywell.

Our Senior Commerce SEO Manager Meaghan Roche also owns this best cooling fan and loves it.

“Honeywell is such a well known brand for home cooling, and this tower fan is the perfect example,” she said. “I bought this fan over two years ago to cool my apartment year-round, and it has held up well over time while keeping my one-bedroom comfortable.”

Roche commented on the easy setup of the cooling tower fan, as well as liking that it came with a remote. She also likes how quiet it is.

“I love that this fan is actually quiet. It’s not distracting if I’m working from home and taking a meeting, but it does provide some background white noise when used at night. The dimmable light is also a huge plus for me, as I prefer to sleep in total darkness (yes, I love my blackout curtains). Since this is a tower fan, it may not be as cooling as a box fan or proper air conditioner, but I find it perfect for spring, fall and winter to help air circulate and cool, and it’s a great value for the price.”

Best Budget-Friendly Fan: Commercial Electric High Velocity Floor Fan

Size: 22.9 x 25 x 11.2 inches, 10.7 pounds

Number of speeds: three

It’s hard to find a better deal on a high-powered floor fan with a 360° tilt range. The setup was quite simple — but it is important to attach the legs properly so you can enjoy the adjustability feature. After that, you have a fully functioning floor fan. The metal material is exceptionally durable, sturdy, and it’s powder-coated (which means rust-resistant!). I also appreciate that there is a handle on top of this fan for easy carrying. There are only three-speed choices, but I was impressed with how each mode delivered a noticeably different amount of airflow. This fan is ideal for someone who wants a straightforward fan that lasts for years.

Best Pedestal Fan: Vornado VFAN Sr. Pedestal Vintage Air Circulator Fan

Size: 15.5 x 18.1 x 55 inches, 24 pounds

Number of speeds: three

This was the only “cool” fan that didn’t break the strict aesthetic of my college apartment which was communally decorated by five 22-year-old girls. The retro-inspired pedestal fan not only looks fantastic but also has an impressive 8,300+ reviews and an impressive 4.6-star rating. Personally, my favorite part of this device is that it is adjustable. The movable tilt head allows you to direct the air where you need it, which is very refreshing when you need that extra hit of airflow in the middle of a hot summer. It does have multi-directional air flow, but I enjoy the ability to target certain hot spots within the room as well. The base is also adjustable so you can customize the height. My only gripe with this timeless, Vornado fan is that it’s not remote-controlled (guess that is part of being vintage, though).

Best Splurge: Dyson Pure Cool TP09 Purifying Fan

Behold the best air conditioning you’ve ever experienced. I had some reservations about spending so much money on a fan — until I tried the Dyson Pure Cool Purifying Fan. This fan is easily worth every penny. The machine projects over 77 gallons of air a second for cooling airflow while also purifying the air around you — standing in front of it truly feels like a spa-like experience. The tower comes in two different colors and is truly the prettiest piece of decor in my living room. According to the brand, the 360-degree HEPA filtration removes gases and 99.97% of allergens and pollutants. Reviewers have went as far to say that this fan helped reduce their asthma attacks during the night. I also love that this fan can be controlled by voice or app, for the ultimate hands-free experience. There is even a night mode, where the fan switches to the quietest settings and a dimmed display to accommodate light sleepers. For the smartest, splurge-worthy fan on the market, go with Dyson.

Best Handheld Fan: O2COOL Elite Battery Powered Handheld Water Misting Fan

Size: 3.8 x 3.8 x 11 inches, 200 grams

Number of speeds: one

While this isn’t the fan to cool down your entire room, it’s always a good idea to keep a portable, hand-held misting fan by your side. This one is battery-operated, comes with two flexible blades and is available in a variety of cool shades like bright pink. I decided to give this tiny fan a shot, and now it’s hard to go anywhere without it. To be clear, it mostly travels around in my gym bag for a nice, refreshing post-workout breeze. The water mist is a great feature for helping cool down your body, and I absolutely love that the blades are soft. For someone as uncoordinated as me, it does provide a bit of relief that I won’t be chopping off my fingers trying to turn this on after a sweaty workout. I highly recommend this little fan for someone always on the go.

Best for Outdoors: Shark FlexBreeze Fan with InstaCool Misting

Size: 13.8 x 13.8 x 37 inches, 12.2 pounds

Number of speeds: five

There is nothing more disappointing that being forced to stay inside on a summer day when the heat is unbearable. With the FlexBreeze Fan, you can enjoy outdoor weather while staying refreshed. I was thrilled to put this fan together (in just a few easy steps) and test out both the cordless and plugged-in power mode. While plugged-in, the fan works in full blow — reducing temperatures to feel up to 10 degrees cooler. It may not be quite as powerful when switched to battery power, but the 20-hour runtime makes up for that — you can enjoy a prolonged cool from the comfort of your patio. Plus, I learned that that the fan comes with a misting attachment so you can hook your fan up to a hose for an ultimate breeze boost. Sounds pretty luxurious to me.

Best Desk Fan: Hampton Bay Portable Desk Fan in Black

Size: 14 x 15.3 x 7.7 inches, 5.3 pounds

Number of speeds: three

If you’re looking for the perfect compact fan for your desk space, I would opt for this Hampton Bay model. This budget-friendly find is a great size for just about any table setting and features sturdy, slip-resistant feet so it stays in place. My favorite part about this desk fan is that it requires no tools and comes right out of the box fully assembled. For someone who hates reading directions, this is certainly the fan to go with. While it only offers three speeds, the tilt-back head allows you to direct the airflow where you like, for an optimal breeze. It’s not the most quiet fan on the market, but the sound is rather smooth and disruptive. It’s easy to work alongside.

Best Oscillating Fan: Lasko 2535 52″ Oscillating Pedestal Fan

Size: 14 x 14 x 52 inches, 12 pounds

Number of speeds: three

With a baby in the house, you start thinking about all the ways to childproof your living space. A mom friend recommended the Lasko fan for a sturdy, blade-free option that is also a bit heavier (ie. more difficult to tip over). It’s nice hybrid between a tower and pedestal fan that offers oscillation, as well as a large adjustable base that keeps the important technology off the ground and away from curious, tiny hands. The fan took about 15 minutes to assemble, and you can feel the air movement from roughly 12 feet away. Being able adjust the speed, timer, oscillation, and sleep mode right from the remote is also a huge plus. The bottom line: it’s a convenient fan for a busy household.

Other Cooling Fans We Recommend

Best Portable Fan: RowentaTurbo Silence Standing Floor Fan

Size: 7.2 D x 24 W x 20 H, 19.6 pounds

Number of speeds: 5

We love the portability of the Rowenta Pedestal Fan. Bring it into your home office during the work day, and then transfer it to the living room or bedroom when evening comes. It offers five different speed settings, including Turbo Boost for when things are extra hot. It also operates via remote control, so you don’t have to get off the couch to switch modes, because that can also work up a sweat! A timer is built-in as well, making it energy efficient for when its on at night.

Although some customers are not pleased with the light on the fan, most are happy with its overall look and performance. Note that you’ll need to have a battery handy for the remote and put the fan together. However, it’s relatively simple and once you’re through, you can sit back and enjoy the cool breeze.

Customers are saying: “I was looking for a fan that was quiet and moved a lot of air. This one does both. I can comfortably circulate cool air through my home without the need to blast the volume to hear the TV. It’s such a huge improvement over the old box fans I had been using for years. I’m mad I didn’t get this sooner. Assembly was easy and intuitive and only took a few minutes, but I could see how it might be tricky if you’re not used to putting things together. The instructions aren’t the best. If I have one criticism, for the price of this fan, it’s kind of silly that the remote control doesn’t include a battery. It takes a coin-sized battery similar to what most car key fobs use, so fortunately I had an extra in the house.”

Best 3-In-1 Fan: Dyson Purifier Humidify+Cool Formaldehyde PH04

Size: 2.3 D x 12.3 W x 36.3 H, 18 pounds

Number of speeds: 1

Okay, we know this is a pricey cooling fan. It’s also a Dyson.

And when you think about its 3-in-1 design, it sort of pays for itself. Part humidifier, part fan, part air purifier, you’ll save on space and money in the long run. There’s an auto mode to set and forget the humidifier portion, plus the LCD screen alerts you when the airflow needs to be increased. The device also used a HEPA filter, which can capture 99.97% of particles — even ones that are only 0.3 microns small. While the fan won’t make you feel as cool as an AC, the circulation from the Dyson Purifier Humdify + Cool Formaldehyde-PH04 will make the heat feel less cumbersome and stagnant.

Best for Sleeping: Vornado 660 Large Air Circulator Fan

Size: 11.75 D x 13.5 W x 15 H, 7.32 pounds

Number of speeds: 4

It’s amazing how such a small fan could do such a mighty job at cooling down a hot room. However, it’s possible and this fan proves it. Capable of pushing air up 100 feet, the Vornado 660 Large Air Circulator Fan is one of our favorites for NYC apartments, as well as home offices or, if you’re lucky enough, in-office cubical. It has push button controls, which means there are no fancy apps or smart tech to deal with before cooling down. The fan moves along a chrome slide to achieve multi-directional airflow, so even if you’re not sitting directly in front of it, you’ll get a nice breeze.

Customers are saying: “I needed a fan to move cool air from elsewhere in the house into the part of the house where the wood stove generates heat. This fan gives a good solid, focused stream of air that gets the cool air all the way into the room, and you can hardly hear it! The low fan speed is the feature that makes the most difference. [It’s the] feature that makes it quiet enough to run all the time and not get worn out by a constant whine. Excellent product.”

How We Tested

For this cooling fan review, I was focused on evaluating a few main points: the strength of the airflow, style and design, as well as any additional technological features. I also took note of how long it took to assemble each of the fans, and whether there were any quality issues. It is worthwhile to note that the fans were tested in my apartment living room, which is not a very large space. Shoppers looking to cool down larger areas may need to test the fans in a space which requires more diffusion.

Airflow: While most shoppers are looking for fans with the strongest airflow, I also looked for the differences in the airflow settings — to determine whether each fan had distinct options for different cooling needs. I stood at various distances away from the fan to measure the strength and consistency of the airflow.

Design: When it comes to design and style, every shopper has their own preferences. Some prefer larger and heavier floor fans, while others look for lighter and taller tower fans. Some of the fans I have tested have a more sleek, modern design while others have a vintage, retro look to them. I took note of all of these differences, as well as the color options.

Technology: Each of the fans I tested featured very different technology. Some of the more advanced options, like the Dyson, feature voice control. Many offered remote control. Some had automatic settings to turn off, or flip to a quieter ‘night mode.’ I’ve made note of all the unique features in my review.

What type of fan is best for cooling?

The best type of fan for cooling is a floor fan. Here’s why: they’re designed to circulate airflow throughout the room, which is exactly what you want when the temperature rises.

A floor fan can also:

Make air feel less stagnant

Help evaporate moisture from your skin

Cool surfaces

They’re also typically more energy-efficient and budget-friendly than AC units, making them a great, portable option when the weather is hot.

One of our favorites — okay, our favorite cooling floor fan that we reviewed is the Honeywell QuietSet Oscillating Tower Stand Fan. Along with having five speeds, it has dimmable features and touch control, so it’s breezy (pun intended) to control.

Additionally, tower fans, in general, are slim, so they don’t take up a lot of space.

If you’re looking for something a bit lower to the ground, we also recommend the Vornado 660 Large Air Circulator Fan. It’s less than 15 pounds, so it’s easy to move from room to room. More importantly, it can move air up to 100 feet, which means it can cool a bedroom, living room or office space without issue.

Does putting ice in front of a fan work?

Yes, putting ice in front of a fan works. It acts as a coolant. The air moves over the ice, making it more chill — literally.

However, there are some safety things to consider, mainly that water and electricity don’t mix. It’s important to keep ice far enough away from the fan (use a bucket or bowl) to avoid accidents.

If that’s too much of a hassle, try placing your cooling fan in front of a large piece of furniture. No, really. The position will force air to circulate and move over the piece. This will also balance the overall room temperature, making it feel more comfortable.

dbb3e5c2b2,The Globe and Mail,"Wednesday’s analyst upgrades and downgrades for July 3, 2024 - The Globe and Mail","Inside the Market’s roundup of some of today’s key analyst actions

The investor pessimism swirling around Air Canada (AC-T) and its peers feels “overdone,” according to National Bank Financial analyst Cameron Doerksen.

“We appreciate that the market is concerned about the sustainability of air travel demand and pricing as well as the ongoing contract talks with Air Canada’s pilot union,” he said. “However, we believe that the current share price reflects an overly dire scenario for Air Canada.

“On our updated 2024 forecast, which assumes a 3.0-per-cent decline in passenger unit revenues and non-fuel unit costs towards the high end of Air Canada’s guidance range, Air Canada shares are trading at just 2.9 times EV/EBITDA and 7.0 times P/E. This is below the historical average forward multiples (excluding the pandemic years) of 4.3 times EV/EBITDA and 9.0 times P/E. If we assumed that AC’s shares should trade at its historical average forward EV/EBITDA multiple in a trough earnings scenario, the current share price implies that 2024 EBITDA would come in at $2.5-billion, a 38-per-cent decline from the $4.0-billion Air Canada generated in 2023. We note that Q1/24 EBITDA was higher year-over-year.”

In a research report released Wednesday previewing its second-quarter financial results, Mr. Doerksen emphasized the airline’s current valuation now sits “at levels last seen during the depths of the pandemic.”

“During the pandemic, which effectively shut down air travel and forced airlines into survival mode, Air Canada saw its market cap fall from over $13-billion in January 2020 to just over $3-billion in March of that year (a decline of over 75 per cent),” he noted. “AC’s market cap rebounded late in 2020 and again in mid-2021 (briefly hovering over $10-billion, although this was partially due to two separate share issuances in Q4/20 and Q2/21) but has largely declined since then despite a dramatic financial turnaround and de-leveraging through 2023 (market cap currently sits at approximately $6.4-billion).

“In addition, compared to the U.S. peer group, Air Canada’s share price performance has largely underperformed since the beginning of 2023, only outperforming American Airlines (noting that this is mostly due to a large decline in AAL’s stock price in May after a profit warning). Delta shares have increased 42 per cent since the start of 2023 and United is up 28 per cent while AC’s stock has declined over 7 per cent over the same period.”

Mr. Doerksen thinks the primary headwind to investor sentiment for Air Canada shares in the near-term remains the uncertainty around negotiations with its pilot union, and he expects that to continue until a deal is reach. Following the disruptions caused by the strike by WestJet’s mechanics union, he predicts the federal government may get involved given Air Canada’s market position and the potential impact of the disruption to the country’s travel industry.

Believing its financial position “remains strong,” the analyst emphasized the demand for air travel “is not collapsing.”

“Based on CATSA passenger screening data at Canada’s largest airports, the most recent 7-day rolling average of passenger traffic in Canada was up 4.8 per cent year-over-year and so far this year, has largely been higher than last year. Airfares in Canada have stabilized the last three months with the most recent numbers from Statistics Canada showing prices up 4.5 per cent year-over-year in May and 15.6 per cent ahead of May 2019. We expect some yield erosion for AC in the coming quarters due mainly to tough comps, especially on Atlantic routes, but domestic prices look relatively health.”

“Overall Canadian industry domestic capacity in Q3/24, as measured by seats, is projected to be up 0.9 per cent year-over-year but down 7.1 per cent versus Q3/19. The U.S. trans-border market will see industry capacity up 13.7 per cent year-over-year in Q3 while international capacity to and from Canada is set to increase 8.7 per cent year-over-year. Air Canada should see particular strength this summer on Pacific routes where traffic was up 36 per cent in Q1 and yields flat despite a 38-per-cent increase in capacity.”

With updates to his 2024 forecast, which assumes a 3-per-cent decline in passenger unit revenues and non-fuel unit costs towards the high end of its guidance range, Mr. Doerksen trimmed his target for Air Canada shares to $28 from $30, keeping an “outperform” rating. The average target on the Street is $26.72, according to LSEG data.

Calling it “a repositioned company” as it transitions from a predominantly oil and gas company to a more industrials-oriented business, RBC Dominion Securities analyst Arthur Nagorny upgraded Mattr Corp. (MATR-T) to “outperform” from “sector perform” on Wednesday.

“As Mattr works through the bulk of its growth capex program throughout the remainder of 2024, we believe top-line growth will begin to accelerate in H2 and beyond, which we believe will be more appropriately reflected in the company’s valuation over time,” he said.

“We believe management has done a good job of repositioning Mattr from a predominantly oil & gas focused company to a more industrials-oriented business over the last few years. The company has sold off most of its oil & gas subsidiaries since late 2020, with the sale of a substantial majority of Pipeline Performance Group (“PPG”) in November 2023 marking the completion of the company’s strategic review. Today, three of Mattr’s four remaining core businesses are exposed to industrial end-markets, which we believe are substantially less volatile than the company’s historical Pipeline & Pipe Services segment businesses (58 per cent of revenue in 2019). Despite this repositioning, Mattr’s valuation (5.6 times EV/ NTM consensus EBITDA) is only modestly above its 3-year average (5.1 times) and meaningfully below peers (9.0 times/9.0 times across Connection/Composite Technologies peers) even though the company has a stronger growth outlook (we forecast 2025 EBITDA/EPS growth of 22 per cent/35 per cent year-over-year, vs. 11 per cent/15 per cent for Connection Technologies peers and 15 per cent/7 per cent for Composite Technologies peers). As Mattr executes on its growth targets, we see potential for the valuation discount vs. peers to close over time.”

Mr. Nagorny raised his target for shares of the Toronto-based company, formerly known as Shawcor Ltd., to $20 from $18. The average target on the Street is $22.78.

National Bank Financial analyst Dan Payne sees Topaz Energy Corp.’s (

TPZ-T +0.56%increase

) $100-million infrastructure deal with Whitecap Resources Inc. (

WCP-T +1.04%increase

) as a “very much an on-strategy acquisition for the company, with a number of strategic tailwinds, and the accretion of which should serve to maintain the positive momentum of shareholder value and its associated equity performance.”

Before the bell on Tuesday, Calgary-based Topaz announced the cash agreement, which centres on a 50-per-cent non-operated working interest in Whitecap’s newly commissioned natural gas and condensate facility in the Musreau area of the Alberta Montney.

“Implied transaction metrics of the transaction are forecast at around 7.0-7.5 times; these are accretive metrics, expanding its cash flow per share and FCF per share by approximately 4-5 per cent, respectively. Its infrastructure take-or-pay revenue expands by 20 per cent to a 26-per-cent proportional weighting (from 22 per cent), and which now covers nearly half of its dividend payout (from 1/3rd),” he said. “The acquisition is expected to be funded through its existing free cash and balance sheet, with leverage metrics expanding to about 1.1 times D/EBITDA at year-end (from prior 0.8 times).”

Mr. Payne thinks the acquired assets diversifies Topaz’s “regional exposure in to the high-impact Montney liquids fairway (from its preexisting TOU assets in the area that are predominantly Deep Basin oriented assets), while maintains the quality-bias of its assets (long-duration, new & high-utilization assets assigned to a quality counterparty).”

“Perhaps more importantly, the acquisition proves its proactivity in the A&D market, expanding its non-TOU infrastructure assets in an opportunistic fashion in association with one of its pre-existing (and similarly proactive) counterparties – that positive alignment of interests throughout being a significant strategic advantage,” he added.

Reiterating his “outperform” recommendation for Topaz shares, Mr. Payne raised his target by $1 to $28.50. The average target on the Street is $28.25.

“Recall, its dividend payout remains at the low-end of its target range (with upside to its cash yield to come as execution persists over the long-term), and peer comps (9.4-per-cent aggregate FCF yield vs. prevailing 10.1 per cent) suggest a near-term re-rate towards $26 is prospective,” he said.

Other analysts making target adjustments include:

* RBC’s Robert Kwan to $28 from $27 with an “outperform” rating.

“Topaz’s acquisition of interest in Whitecap’s Musreau facility is in line with strategy, and adds an additional plank of infrastructure (and incremental 13-14-per-cent yield) to the portfolio. We remain constructive on the story,” said Mr. Kwan.

* CIBC’s Jamie Kubik to $27 from $26 with an “outperformer” rating.

* Canaccord Genuity’s Mike Mueller to $29 from $28.50 with a “buy” rating.

* Jefferies’ Anthony Linton to $27 from $25 with a “buy” rating.

In response to the heap leach pad failure at its Eagle gold mine in central Yukon last week, Ventum Capital Markets analyst Alex Terentiew moved his recommendation for Victoria Gold Corp. (VGCX-T) to “under review” from “buy” previously, calling the incident, which has caused its shares to drop by almost 85 per cent, “significantly negative.”

First Nation concerned Victoria Gold, Yukon government playing down impact of Eagle mine rockslide

“Considering the limited details provided regarding the remedial costs and timeline, the impact on the mine and environment, and the Company’s eventual ability to restart operations (essentially, the future is unknown), we have changed our rating to Under Review and removed our estimate of potential future value,” he said. “Overall, we expect the Company’s share price to be under pressure and volatile as the situation at its Eagle mine unfolds.”

With a “a substantial amount” of information on the incident and the Whitehorse-based company’s next steps unknown, Mr. Terentiew thinks future cash flow forecasts are “very uncertain.”

“Following the HLP failure, we expect several months of technical and environmental assessments will be needed before a technically viable plan can be formulated to bring the mine back into production,” he added. “In addition, we expect VGCX will have to re-apply for several permits to get Eagle back into production, and with regulators on heightened alert, re-permitting could take time. We note that the Eagle mine is an important economic driver in the Yukon, and we believe the government is likely to be cooperative in the restarting process.

“Long-term value remains, but with great uncertainty in the near term. Our estimates prior to the incident used a gold price of US$2000/oz and yielded a NAV of $1,124 for the Eagle Mine. If gold prices remain strong, we see an opportunity for value creation beyond the looming debt and remediation liabilities.”

Mr. Terentiew removed a target for Victoria Gold shares. His previous target was $14, exceeding the $11.19 average on the Street.

“A larger and financially stronger miner could come in and consolidate the mines and projects in the region, but until the permitting status and pathway to reopening the mine are clarified, we expect potential acquirers to stay on the sidelines,” he concluded.

“With $233-million in debt outstanding as of March 31, 2024, we think VGCX may struggle to service its debt and also fund remedial efforts at the mine.”

Seeing its turnaround “in full stride,” RBC Dominion Securities analyst Greg Pardy thinks Suncor Energy Inc. (SU-T) is “well positioned to demonstrate ongoing operating and financial momentum, while addressing its longer term development opportunities.”

In a research note following meetings with its executive vice-president of oilsands Peter Zebedee and vice president of investor relations Troy Little, he reaffirmed the Calgary-based company as his favourite integrated energy producer in Canada and its place on the firm’s “Global Energy Best Ideas” list.

“Our recent meeting ... explored the company’s extensive oil sands portfolio, stepwise improvements in its operating performance and longer-term bitumen supply options,” said Mr. Pardy. “We have believed for some time that Suncor has been rigorously working its development plans behind the scenes. This meeting reinforced our confidence in that regard.”

“What stood out most to us from the discussion with Peter and Troy was the bitumen supply opportunities that Suncor possesses, including integration initiatives. Peter also emphasized that the rate at which its Millennium/North Steepbank mines run will be optimized well into the next decade as other barrels are added to the mix.”

Touting its organic growth opportunities and long-term production profile, the analyst kept an “outperform” recommendation and $65 target for Suncor shares. The average is $59.79.

“At current levels and under futures pricing, Suncor is trading at a 2024 estimated debt-adjusted cash flow multiple of 5.0 times (vs. our global major peer group avg. of 6.1 times) and a free cash flow yield of 11 per cent (vs. our peer group avg. of 9 per cent),” said Mr. Pardy. “We believe the company should trade at an average multiple vis-à-vis our peer group given its physical integration, attractive downstream assets, free cash flow generation, solid balance sheet and rising shareholder returns, somewhat counterbalanced by the need to address its Base Mine depletion down the road.”

In other analyst actions:

* Following its acquisition Port Huron, Mich.-based Xtreme PowerlIne Construction for US$73-million, Canaccord Genuity’s Yuri Lynk lowered his Street-high Aecon Group Ltd. (ARE-T) target to $25 from $26, keeping a “buy” rating. Other changes include: Raymond James’ Frederic Bastien to $16 from $17 with a “market perform” rating and Stifel’s Ian Gillies to $16.50 from $16.25 with a “hold” recommendation. The average is $18.64.

“This is the first acquisition for the company’s utilities roll-up strategy, and we believe it has a strong strategic rationale with a reasonable valuation (5.0 times EV/EBITDA),” said Mr. Gillies. “We find the Utilities’ roll-up strategy attractive, and this deal depicts the ability to acquire at attractive multiples (which had been in question). However, it does not outweigh our concerns over the four fixed-price legacy contracts. We have modestly increased our target price to $16.50 from $16.25, but retain our HOLD rating (despite nearly 25-per-cent upside due to higher-than-average risk).”

* CIBC’s Krista Friesen cut her target for Badger Infrastructure Solutions Ltd. (BDGI-T) to $52 from $55 with an “outperformer” rating. The average is $54.38.

* Acumen Capital’s Nick Corcoran raised his Cargojet Inc. (CJT-T) target to $175 from $165 with a “buy” rating. The average is $156.91.

“Flight data for Q2/24 shows strong momentum driven, in part, by (1) incremental scheduled charter flying for Great Vision HK Express (Great Vision), and (2) ACMI flying for DHL,” he said.

* Stifel’s Stephen Soock trimmed his i-80 Gold Corp. (IAU-T) target to $3.90 from $4.10 with a “buy” rating. The average is $4.15.

“Our recent tour through all i-80s sites in northern Nevada highlighted the amount of infrastructure in place for the company to leverage toward production,” he said. “These assets provide a floor for the company valuation which we believe the stock is near. We saw active work on all the pieces that will come together to make i-80 a 250koz/yr Nevada-only producer. The recent $115-million equity financing will allow the company to accelerate work to support the studies needed to show a clear path forward to bring the autoclave online and get to this level of significant production, generating $200-million per year in site-level free cash flow. ""

* CIBC’s Kevin Chiang reduced his Mullen Group Ltd. (MTL-T) target to $15.50 from $16 with an “outperformer” rating. The average is $17.45.

“We have tweaked our EBITDA estimates lower for AND and MTL,” he said. “The silver lining is that the revisions are modest and the general commentary from the trucking names we cover is that the freight environment has not deteriorated further—it simply continues to bounce along the bottom. We also foresee all three companies benefiting from strong liquidity positions, enabling the pursuit of inorganic growth opportunities. We expect MTL and TFII to maintain their 2024 guidance (AND does not provide guidance). Although the cyclical recovery continues to be pushed out, TFII remains one of our preferred names. First, it benefits from a number of company-specific earnings growth levers (improvement in U.S. LTL, lapping restructuring charges incurred last year, rollover benefit from M&A in 2023, tuck-in acquisitions completed this year). Second, as evidenced by updates provided by a number of U.S. LTL players, the LTL operating environment remains rational. Third, TFII has indicated it is evaluating the potential benefits of separating into two distinct public companies—one comprising the TL segment and another comprising the LTL, P&C, and Logistics segments. We believe this move would unlock significant value in TFII’s share price.”

* Mr. Chiang increased his target for Waste Connections Inc. (WCN-N, WCN-T) to US$191 from US$181 with an “outperformer” rating. The average is US$188.35.

“Waste fundamentals remain strong. Our Q2/24 EBITDA estimates for the waste names we cover are in line with consensus expectations but we recognize there is upside potential here given M&A activity, commodity prices, and the strong pricing environment,” he said. “We see GFL, RSG and WCN as positioned to raise their full-year guidance when they report results (WM raised its 2024 outlook with Q1/24 results). Fundamentally, we remain positive on the waste sector. We expect EBITDA margins to be up 104 bps year-over-year, on average, in the quarter, ranging from 51 bps to 139 bps driven by the industry’s pricing-led organic growth algorithm. We expect volumes-related commentary to remain muted. Tactically, our preferred name heading into Q2/24 results is WCN. While GFL is our other Outperformer-rated waste name and it continues to trade at a discount to its peers, the run-up in its share price since May 31, 2024 (up 26 per cent) creates a higher bar when it reports its Q2 results.”

* Jefferies’ Anthony Linton raised his Pembina Pipeline Corp. (PPL-T) target to $56 from $55 with a “buy” rating, while CIBC’s Robert Catellier bumped his target to $59 from $58 with an “outperformer” rating. The average is $55.17.

“Pembina Gas Infrastructure Inc. (PGI) has agreed to acquire a 50-per-cent working interest in the 15-07 Kaybob Complex from Whitecap Resources Inc. for $420-million ($252-million net to PPL) and to fund Whitecap’s Lator area development. The two parties have also entered into a variety of long-term take-or-pay agreements that will add value across Pembina’s integrated value chain. We see the agreement as on-strategy, as it should enhance utilization of key gas plants, increase exposure to key producing areas in the Montney and Duvernay, and support the company’s ethane supply commitments for DOW Inc.’s ethylene cracker,” said Mr. Catellier.","A white Air Canada airplane with a red maple leaf logo is captured mid-flight, viewed from below with its landing gear down, against a clear sky.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x140 at 0x7D6BA58D60E0>,2024-07-03 10:42:50.669000+00:00,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-wednesdays-analyst-upgrades-and-downgrades-for-july-3/,['Business and Finance' 'Other'],[0.95 0.05],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/dbb3e5c2b2.png

4d9d4858a5,ABC News,3 reasons why racist attacks on Harris could backfire - ABC News,"Vice President Kamala Harris has faced a barrage of racist attacks on her qualifications and background since President Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential campaign. On July 31, former President Donald Trump fanned those flames at the National Association of Black Journalists' annual convention when he falsely claimed that Harris ""happened to turn Black"" only recently. The Trump campaign has doubled down on those accusations, too, repeating them several times over the past month.

If these attacks were meant to blunt Harris’s momentum, however, they haven’t worked. Trump has clearly lost ground in the polls since his NABJ appearance, and his rhetoric at the event was heavily criticized by the news media, Democrats and even some high-profile Republicans. It turns out, this was predictable. Survey data and political science research tells us there are three big reasons why Trump’s remarks will likely hurt his presidential campaign.

Trump is emphasizing one of his biggest liabilities

First, and perhaps most importantly, Trump's attacks on Harris's racial identity refocuses attention on arguably his weakest issue. I noted back in June 2020, for example, that Trump regularly received his lowest issue approval ratings for his handling of race relations. Trump's net approval ratings (approval minus disapproval) on race were consistently around 30 percentage points underwater in 2019 surveys.

Those overwhelmingly negative assessments continued throughout his presidency. Voters gave Trump lower scores on race relations than on any other major issue in an October 2020 YouGov/Yahoo News poll. Biden led Trump by a whopping 22-point margin (53 percent to 31 percent) on the survey's question about which candidate would do a better job of handling race relations as president — his biggest advantage over Trump across nine of the most salient issues in the 2020 campaign.

Voters, however, almost always rate ex-presidents' performances more positively in retrospect, and Trump has experienced a similar ""nostalgia bump"" in retrospective approval of his handling of race and several other issues. His net approval rating for how he handled race relations during his presidency was only -11 points in an April 2024 New York Times/Siena College poll. Likewise, Biden's advantage over Trump on the issue of race had dwindled to just 10 points in a June 2024 Suffolk University/USA Today survey.

Attacks on Harris's biracial background by Trump and his allies, therefore, run the risk of reminding nostalgic voters of his presidency's unpopular approach to race relations. They could pose an even bigger problem for Trump by making his poor performance on race a more prominent voting issue. Some political science research contends that the main goal of presidential campaigns is to emphasize advantageous issues so that they might factor more heavily into Americans' votes.

Racist attacks against Harris, however, effectively do the exact opposite. Instead of emphasizing issues on which he has an advantage over the Democrats, such as immigration and inflation, Trump's false attacks on Harris's racial background refocus attention on one of his biggest political liabilities. In keeping with that contention, a clever experiment embedded in a new Fairleigh Dickinson University poll found that Harris's lead against Trump grew significantly among voters who were primed to think about the candidates' race and ethnicity ahead of time.

Rallying Black Americans to Harris

Harris was not particularly popular among Black voters when she jumped into the presidential race. As Samantha Canty and I wrote in July, Black people rated her significantly less favorably than they rated Biden throughout the first three years of their administration.

To be sure, Harris's favorability rating among Black registered voters quickly surged from 71 to 82 percent in Civiqs's daily tracking data soon after she became her party's presumptive nominee. But a 538 analysis of polls conducted July 21-Aug. 17 still showed her trailing Biden's 2020 vote margins among Black respondents. Black respondents also rated Harris 16 points less favorably than they rated former President Barack Obama in a YouGov/The Economist poll (69 and 85 percent, respectively) conducted just a few days before Trump's NABJ appearance.

My research with Canty found that Harris underperforms Obama's popularity by the widest margins among Black voters who score highest in measures of racial solidarity, such as rating Black people very favorably and saying race is very important to their identities. That's bad news for Trump since these racially conscious Black voters are also the most likely to be countermobilized by racist attacks against Harris.

Political science research shows that voters who score highest in measures of racial solidarity are both the quickest to perceive discrimination against members of their group and to politically rally in defense of them. If anything, then, racist attacks on Harris should help solidify her support among the same racially conscious Black voters who had only felt lukewarmly toward her throughout most of her vice presidency.

Mobilizing racially sympathetic whites

Racist attacks against Harris could also backfire by countermobilizing white Americans who think anti-Black discrimination is a major problem in the U.S. After all, Obama offset race-based opposition in part by activating unprecedentedly strong support from such racially sympathetic white Americans.

Racial liberalism has become an even bigger political force in American politics since Obama's presidency. The share of white Americans who viewed racial discrimination and systemic racism as major impediments to Black success increased dramatically during the Trump administration — especially among white Democrats.

But Democrats are far from the only ones who empathize with Black Americans who are treated unfairly. A new book on racial attitudes by Wellesley College political scientist Jennifer Chudy shows that most white people express either ""a great deal"" or ""a lot"" of sympathy with Black Americans who've experienced tangible instances of racial discrimination.

Overtly racist attacks against Harris should, therefore, only make her a more sympathetic figure among this large share of whites who empathize with Black people facing racial discrimination. Indeed, social science research has long suggested that explicitly racist campaign appeals are ineffective precisely because they violate most white Americans' commitment to norms and principles of racial equality. And a recent book from Williams College political scientist Matthew Tokeshi shows that rebutting racist attacks against Black candidates tends to mobilize support from racially sympathetic whites.

Wiens, from Pike Lake, Sask., finished third in Friday's preliminaries with a score of 485.25, while Zsombor-Murray, of Pointe-Claire, Que., secured 10th place with 407.20 points.

China's Cao Yuan had the highest preliminary score at 500.15, followed by Rikuto Tamai of Japan at 497.15.

The top 18 divers advanced to Saturday's semifinal.

Wiens and Zsombor-Murray won bronze together in men's synchronized 10-metre platform diving earlier at the Games.

It was Canada's first-ever medal in the event, and the first Canadian men's diving medal since Alexandre Despatie's silver in the 3m springboard event in Beijing 2008.

Wiens said he needed a mental reset before the individual event.

""Mentally, I just get rid of all the bronze medal stuff that I had in my room. You know, packed it away to bring home, and pretty much reset after two days after that, and came in like it's a new competition. A whole new event,"" he said.

Sitting in third heading into the semifinal, Wiens said he knows he must remain consistent to land a spot in the final.

""I know I've got the dive quality to get into the final, so I'm just going to try to go in and just stay comfy and do what I did in the prelim,"" he said.

China on verge of unprecedented sweep

China is seven for seven in diving gold at the Paris Olympics. Just one to go for an unprecedented sweep of all eight diving golds in the Games.

Chen Yiwen won the women's three-meter springboard on Friday for China's seventh gold medal. Maddison Keeney of Australia took silver, with bronze going to Chang Yani of China.

It was Chen's second gold in Paris after winning earlier in the three-meter synchronized with partner Chang. Both divers were cheered on by a large Chinese crowd waving China's red-and-yellow flag and shouting ""jiayou, jiayou"" — roughly translated as ""let's go"" — each time they prepared to dive.

Chen won with 376.00 points from five dives, followed by Keeney (343.10) and Chang (318.75). Chiara Pellacani of Italy was fourth with 309.60.

WATCH | Full replay of women's 3-metre springboard final:

The sweep could happen Saturday in the final diving session of the Olympics with the men's 10-meter platform.

China dominates all phases of diving but none more than the women's three-meter springboard. China has won the event in 10 straight Olympics.

The last time it didn't win was the 1984 Los Angeles Games, which is where China won its first gold medal in diving.

Chen and Chang set off joyous celebrations earlier in the Games after their synchronized gold. Chen carried Chang — many described it as a ""bridal carry""— in her arms to celebrate. They are both making their Olympic debut and have a strong friendship.

Including Friday's results, China has won 54 of 71 gold medals in diving since 1984. Since the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the country has won 34 of 39 gold medals in the discipline.

Santavy exits after attempting clean-and-jerk

Weightlifter Boady Santavy of Sarnia, Ont., was unable to finish the men's 89-kilogram competition on Friday, exiting after his second attempt in the clean-and-jerk with a right knee injury.

The 27-year-old could be heard in the back room telling his dad and coach, Dalas, about the injury before the latter encouraged Santavy to make a second attempt one kg heavier at 188.

Santavy was trying to become Canada's first men's Olympic medallist in the sport since Montreal's Jacques Demers's silver from the 1984 Los Angeles Games.

""I'm trying to make myself feel better. It might take a bit but for me, getting here was an absolute battle,"" Santavy told CBC Sports. ""So many things happened, and the biggest was surgery on my elbow in the middle of [Olympic] qualification. I managed to come back after surgery and [post] a big enough total to qualify.

""And I found out I was coming [to Paris] super late, so I haven't had really any time to train. I think strength-wise I had a little more in me, but the pain was too much on the knee.""

Santavy's elbow surgery was to repair a torn ulnar collateral ligament that is often associated with pitchers in baseball.

Earlier in Friday's event, Santavy had a best lift of 163 kg in the snatch in which he picked up the barbell and lifted it above his head in one singular motion.

Santavy was fourth in the 96 kg class at the 2021 Olympics in Tokyo, where his total lift of 386 kg was one shy of the silver and bronze medallists.

On Tuesday, he posted a video to his Instagram page of an ""easy"" 170 kg lift in the clean-and-jerk.

Last year, Santavy started losing weight in preparation to drop down to the 89 kg weight class as the 96 kg event had been removed from the Olympic program for Paris.

Santavy owns the Canadian records in the snatch, clean-and-jerk and total lift in the 89 kg, 96 kg and 102 kg weight classes.

Victorious Bulgarian sets 2 world marks

Karlos Nasar of Bulgaria won gold and broke two world records Friday, just over a year after a hotel sink fell on him and severed his left Achilles tendon.

Nasar was showering the night before an awards ceremony in May 2023 when he reached for shampoo and pressed down, causing the sink to fall out of the wall and onto him. After undergoing emergency surgery and missing six months, he returned in December and set the clean-and-jerk world record that he surpassed in this event.

A Paris native, the 21-year-old lifted 180 kg in the snatch and a world record 224 in the clean-and-jerk in his Olympic debut with a score of 404, also a world mark.

Yeison Lopez of Colombia took silver with a 390 kg total lift and Italy's Antonino Pizzolato picked up bronze (384 kg).","A male diver in a red swimsuit is captured mid-air during a dive, with his arms extended and legs bent at the knees.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BCAD59930>,2024-08-09 14:53:00+00:00,https://www.cbc.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/summer/aquatics/diving/canadian-divers-wiens-zsombor-murray-10m-platform-semifinal-1.7289990,['Sports' 'International'],[0.95 0.7 ],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/f4e3152df2.png
2a295baf78,The Guardian,Keir Starmer put on the back foot over treatment of Diane Abbott - The Guardian,"Keir Starmer began his day by taunting Rishi Sunak for the faltering start to the Conservative’s election campaign.

On a visit to Wales the Labour leader said Sunak thought he was laying a trap by calling a snap summer election but a series of blunders since meant he had “caught himself in his own ambush”.

By the evening, however, it was Starmer who was on the back foot, with the Tories crowing that he was being undermined by his own deputy, Angela Rayner, over the fate of Diane Abbott.

In an interview with the Guardian, Rayner said she saw no reason why Abbott should not be allowed to stand again for Labour now the whip had been restored, although she indicated Abbott might yet opt to retire.

That had been the original plan, according to Labour insiders, until it was jeopardised by an unauthorised briefing that she would be barred from standing again, riling her allies and leaving some senior party figures shaking their heads in despair.

“It was totally counterproductive,” one admitted. “What were they trying to achieve? We were hoping that it could all be handled with dignity but they couldn’t resist giving her a kicking on the way out.”

Starmer has been accused of blocking leftwing MPs and jetting allies into safe seats. Rayner admitted it was “unfortunate” that some selections were taking place this late but the timing was inevitable to fill vacant seats. She denied the moves were a “purge” of the left.

There were suggestions – not denied by the party – that Sue Gray, Starmer’s chief of staff, has been concerned about the handling of Abbott’s case and that, rather than ending up in a situation that suited everybody, they were now dealing with the fallout from one that suited no one.

The way Abbott’s future has been handled and the spate of Starmer allies being installed in safe seats has made some in the party uncomfortable. There is also concern it could alienate ethnic minority supporters and voters.

One insider said the decision was being made by six white men and “that’s why you end up with this kind of pickle”. But they added that there was little appetite by Labour HQ staff or shadow ministers to make a fuss during the election campaign. “I don’t think there’s the capacity or the willingness to rock the boat internally.”

Another senior Labour figure said: “I can’t deny that I’m dismayed by this by the way this is being run. The way Diane has been treated is outrageous. These people could be ministers running government departments shaping the lives of hundreds of millions of people.”

Others felt the row was a distraction from the issues that voters wanted to focus on, and risked undermining Starmer’s criticism of the Tories that a vote for them would mean more chaos and infighting.

“That’s not to say that resolving the Diane situation isn’t important but we are trying to build to the future,” one said, before adding that Abbott could have decided to cooperate sooner.

One Labour figure suggested that as a result of Rayner’s intervention, which was understood not to have been authorised by Starmer’s office, it was more likely the party would let Abbott decide her own future.

“With Rayner coming in, my gut feeling is that it’s 60/40 that they will let run [Abbott] again. It’s just not worth it. You can’t win every battle. Let’s focus on getting all the good people elected,” they said. “Though there are MPs arguing that we should buckle down for a couple more days and we’ll get through it, and by week-four of the campaign people will have forgotten about it.”

Other Labour officials suggested this was the plan all along. “We’d much rather get this news out the way now so it doesn’t distract next week,” one said. “Let this week be the controversial impositions – it’s happened under every leader.”

There are even whispers that a war with the left is one that those leading Labour’s campaign, Morgan McSweeney and Pat McFadden, wish to wage, in the hope that it once again underlines how the party has moved on from the Jeremy Corbyn era.

If Labour does decide to go ahead with blocking Abbott there will be a showdown moment at a meeting of the party’s national executive committee on Tuesday, when it rubber stamps the party’s candidates.

Alternatively, a three-person NEC panel could call her in for an interview before Tuesday to decide whether or not she should stand. If they opted to block her, there would be a last-minute process to find a replacement candidate.

One senior Labour source said that the leader’s office may have already started taking the temperature of the NEC as there could be a backlash among members even though it is majority Starmer-supporting.

The Labour NEC member Gemma Bolton, a left-winger, told the BBC she would vote to endorse Abbott and that she hoped by the time of the meeting there would be a “clear consensus Diane should be a candidate”.

But other Labour leftwing candidates are, notably, keeping their heads down. “If Keir can do this to Diane, he can do it to anyone,” one said. “But hopefully they’ll see their plans are going down terribly and will decide to stop the factionalism and focus on what the public really wants.”","An image from The Guardian showing a person in a white shirt serving food to another person in a teal shirt, with a focus on the interaction and the setting which appears to be a cafe or food establishment.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BA3030190>,2024-05-30 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/may/30/keir-starmer-put-on-the-back-foot-over-treatment-of-diane-abbott,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/2a295baf78.png
77e09682c8,Financial Times,Transcript: What happens when manufacturing goes away? With Amy Goldstein - Financial Times,"This is an audio transcript of The Economics Show with Soumaya Keynes podcast episode: ‘What happens when manufacturing goes away? With Amy Goldstein’

Soumaya Keynes

Before we begin, we would love to hear a bit more about you and what you like about this show. We are running a short survey, and anyone who takes part before August 29th will be entered into a prize draw for a pair of Bose QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones. You can find a link to the survey and terms and conditions for the prize draw in our show notes.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

What happens when a massive manufacturing plant shuts down? What happens to the people and what happens to the area? Amy Goldstein is a Visiting Fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution, after decades as a reporter with The Washington Post. Her book, Janesville: An American Story won the Financial Times and McKinsey Book of the Year, and she recently wrote a follow-up essay to that book, which is published in the FT. I wanted to talk to her about it and ask what she learned going back to Janesville, the city that experienced such an enormous economic shock during the financial crisis when the local GM car plant closed down. I wanted to ask what happens when manufacturing goes away?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

This is The Economics Show with Soumaya Keynes, and I am joined by Amy Goldstein speaking to me from Washington, DC. Amy, hello.

Amy Goldstein

Hello. It’s a pleasure to be with you.

Soumaya Keynes

Great to have you. Could you start out by telling us a bit about Janesville and what took you there?

Amy Goldstein

Well, Janesville is a small city of about 65,000 people now in southern Wisconsin. It’s in the American heartland. It’s about 100 miles north-west of Chicago, just to give your listeners some sense of where in the United States we’re talking about. And it was a city that had homegrown industrialists in the late 19th and early 20th century. It’s the home of the Parker Pen Company. A man named George Parker, invented a good fountain pen and built a global company called the Parker Pen Company, based in Janesville, Wisconsin.

Soumaya Keynes

That took me through secondary school. That was a good pen.

Amy Goldstein

That was a good pen. And a couple of decades later, there was another industrialist who was running a farm implements factory who persuaded the founder of General Motors to buy his company. And that was the beginning of General Motors in Janesville just after World War I. And the Janesville assembly plant, as it was called, made Chevrolets decade after decade after decade, until two days before Christmas of 2008, when the plant shut down right in the middle of the Great Recession, as we call it in the United States, or you would call it the Global Financial Crisis.

And I was interested in finding out the questions that you just raised: what happens to a perfectly ordinary place when good work goes away? And I wanted to tell this story focused on one place that could be a microcosm or a metaphor for what was happening during the Great Recession in many communities in the United States, and Janesville turned out to be a good place to look at all this.

Soumaya Keynes

OK. So can you tell me a bit more about the GM plant? I mean, how important was it?

Amy Goldstein

The GM plant was for decades the heart of the local economy. It had, at the heyday in the 1970s, about 7,000 workers. Its last year, 2008, it had about 3,000 workers. So it was by far the largest employer. And because it was so old, going back to the early 20th century, it was a place where families passed on jobs one generation to the next. And it also spawned suppliers locally. There were metal factories. There were all kinds of local businesses that existed because the GM plant did. And all of this was propped up by this enormous automobile plant.

GM also had kind of a social function in town. Like the American car industry at large, its workers were unionised. They were part of the United Auto Workers. And that union local had lots of fundraisers and parties and really kind of buoyed the feeling of the community. So when that shut down, along with the plant, that made a big difference too. So it was both the heart of the economy and it was heart of the sort of social life and philanthropic life of this community.

Soumaya Keynes

Yeah, that really struck me reading the book, the kind of the importance of union life to the kind of fabric of the community and also to its sort of local politics. That was one thread that you brought out, and that they were actually quite important in terms of political organising, I guess, for the Democrats.

Amy Goldstein

Well, that’s right. I mean, you know, there were lots and lots of reasons why of all the places in the United States that lost jobs during the Great Recession, I picked Janesville. In terms of the politics, I figured it was going to be an interesting place to learn about. It had this big Democratic-leaning union population that we’ve just been talking about.

Soumaya Keynes

OK, well, I want to get more into that. But before we do, can we just talk about the closure of the plant? I mean, why exactly did it close?

Amy Goldstein

Well, General Motors was in very bad financial shape at this time. As I said, it closed just before the end of 2008. And several months later, in 2009, it filed for bankruptcy, which was just an unimaginable thing for one of these big automakers. So it was cutting costs. It was closing plants, not all plants, but a number of plants at the same time that Janesville closed, and Janesville was vulnerable. It was the oldest operating General Motors plant at the time that it was shut down. And for years, people in town had this sort of dual feeling about that. They wondered whether they’d be vulnerable to closing because it was so old. But it had been going and going and going for so long, and it had escaped other sort of near-death moments that people also kind of figured to keep going forever. So, at the time that it closed, the Janesville assembly plant was making full-sized SUVs, sport utility vehicles. And if you think about the price of gas during the Great Recession, it was very, very high. It was over $4 a gallon. And SUVs were not popular cars for Americans to buy. So the market for them really was shrinking during this time. And there was another plant in Texas that was making the same kind of vehicles, and General Motors decided that it didn’t need both, and Janesville was a victim.

Soumaya Keynes

So I think this is just so fascinating because, you know, obviously you’ve got so many narratives about the decline of manufacturing in particular places. You’ve got this story of imports and those driving away manufacturing jobs. You also just have the Great Recession, right? Huge hit to aggregate demand for cars. You’ve also got these kind of product-specific trends. So, you know, SUVs and gas, as you were saying. And then also you’ve got this kind of competition between places, between places within the US, for manufacturing work. So, you know, it could be that manufacturing jobs went away from a particular place within America. And actually some of them went to a different state where perhaps the labour laws were different and more kind of favourable to employers.

Amy Goldstein

Well, that’s right. And on your point about imports, you know, many people think that the closing of the Janesville assembly plant was part of a global trend and American jobs moving to other countries. And that actually wasn’t the case. It was more the points that you were making about the terrible economy at the time, the fact that these vehicles weren’t selling well, and the fact that there were two plants making them and this company that was in very fragile financial shape itself, decided that just needed one of those factories.

Soumaya Keynes

OK. Well, look, I want to move on to one of the kind of key elements of your book, which is the stories of individual people as they were affected by this shock. So you followed people, families affected as these jobs went away. Could you share a couple of examples?

Amy Goldstein

The core people were families with autoworkers who lost work. So one was a family called the Vaughns. And like all of these families, they were multigenerational auto workers. The father of Mike Vaughn, his name was Dave Vaughn, he had worked at the General Motors plant, and he had retired. And he was the second generation of the Vaughn family who was a union leader in town. Now, Mike Vaughn, who was in his late thirties when all this work collapsed, didn’t work at General Motors. They weren’t hiring when he came of age. So he went to work at Lear Seating, the big seat-making plant that was very dependent on General Motors. And he became the top union guy at Lear. So he was the third generation of the union Vaughns, and he met his wife at Lear, they both lost their work, it was not a good situation. And Mike was one of many people in town who went back to a local technical college that was doing a lot of job retraining. He was looking for union jobs in several states in the Midwest, you know, not just in Wisconsin, but nearby, and couldn’t find anything that seemed appropriate. So he finally went back to school.

And he was trying to think about what kind of new work would make use of the union skills that he had developed. And Blackhawk Technical College, the school that was doing this retraining, was starting a programme in human resources management. And Mike Vaughn thought, well, that would make use of some of the leadership skills and organising skills, and working with people skills that he had acquired as a union leader at Lear. But if you think of the name of that field, it has the word “management” in it, and it was a very hard decision for him to switch from the union side, which had been going back generations in his family, to the management side. But he did make that transition. So that’s one family.

Another family is the Wopat family. And they also had several generations of GM workers. The older-generation Marv Wopat retired from General Motors the summer before the plant closed down. And Marv was a big figure in town. He had been somebody whose job at the plant for a long time had been kind of counselling people who might have alcoholism or mental health issues or struggles going on in their family. So he knew a lot of people at the plant and their secrets, and he had this big, big party this summer before GM closed. And by the time that party happened, he knew that his son Matt, who was working at General Motors, was going to be laid off. And Matt eventually decided that he was going to do something he had just sworn he was never going to do, and that was to become something called a GM gypsy. Now, people in Janesville were called GM gypsies because if you had worked at the General Motors plant itself, you had the opportunity to take a job if one was open at another General Motors plant elsewhere in the United States, and people did this, they would commute. And Matt was a really big family guy, he had sworn he never wanted to live away from his family, but a set of jobs opened up at a GM plant in Fort Wayne, Indiana, still in the Midwest, but a couple of states over from Wisconsin. And he very, very reluctantly decided to do that. So in the spring of, early spring of 2010, began a commuting life where he and some of his General Motors buddies from Janesville would drive early Monday morning to Indiana to work there during the week, had an apartment there, and would come home on late, late Friday night. So that was Matt’s transition.

Soumaya Keynes

Right, yeah. I mean, that really speaks to this point, that there were just so many dimensions of, you know, how good your job is, right? So maybe that job in the factories, two states over, wouldn’t have been that much worse-paid than the old one. But the deterioration in the quality of life associated with having to commute all that distance and then be away with your family, that kind of thing might not show up so easily in, you know, standard economic surveys.

Amy Goldstein

Well, that’s right. And it all kind of speaks to what my big idea was, which is I wanted to focus on families, each of which found a different answer to the big question of: what do you do when your job goes away, and there’s no obvious good solution? So I was trying to help readers understand the different choices that people made.

Soumaya Keynes

Right. So now I want to ask what you think the big lessons from Janesville were that thinking about that first period that you looked at in your book?

Amy Goldstein

Well, I think there are several big lessons. I mean, one is what I just said, which is that there’s no clear road map for what to do when work you think is going to last for ever suddenly disappears on you. And losing work is a very, very hard experience. And I think one of the things I learned is that falling out of the middle class is very different than having been poor all along. As part of the work for this book, I worked with some researchers at the University of Wisconsin and did a survey of the county. Just a one county survey that Janesville’s in. This was five years after the plant closed, to see what people’s economic attitudes and experiences were. And we asked a lot of questions about if you or someone in your home had lost a job during the Great Recession, how did it affect you? And it was really striking how many people told us that they were having disagreements in their family, they were avoiding social situations, they felt ashamed. And I thought, how powerful? Because these were people who lost work during what had been the worst period of the economy in the United States since the Great Depression of the 1930s. And all of these people around them were losing the same kind of work, and nevertheless, it felt very, very personal to them. It felt like a personal failure when objectively, that wasn’t true at all.

Soumaya Keynes

Can I ask about the effects of job retraining? Because that’s another thing that you really focused on. How effective do you think it is or can be?

Amy Goldstein

Well, I mean, job retraining is an interesting policy question, because it’s one of the few economic remedies in this country that Republicans and Democrats tend to agree on. It’s very widely embraced. And yet, what I found, at least in the context of this community at this time in the US economy, is that it wasn’t all that helpful.

I talked to a lot of people who had gone back to school, and I did another piece of quantitative work, looking at data on what happened to people who had lost work in Janesville and then did or did not retrain. And it turned out that the people who went back to school, you know, not necessarily today, but a few years after they had gone back to school, were not faring as well as people who had not gone back to school. They were less likely to be working full time. If they were working more likely to have lower incomes and those who had not retrained. These were obviously very counterintuitive findings to the common wisdom.

But talking with lots of people, both in this community and people who think about things like this for a living, I came to think that job retraining can be helpful, but it really depends on the context. If you’re in a place or a time when jobs aren’t coming back, retraining isn’t necessarily going to be the route to new work.

Soumaya Keynes

Yeah. I mean, I’m definitely aware of a study in the trade adjustment assistance space. So this is a policy helping workers who were affected by import competition. I think there was an evaluation of that during the Great Recession, and it was found to be incredibly ineffective because the people who did go straight back to work without doing the retraining, they were the ones who kind of had jobs and kept them. Whereas by the time the people who had finished their training were looking to find a job, there just wasn’t anything there. And so, you know, you do need that demand for workers for the retraining to be useful.

OK. Well, look, I want to throw to a break now, but when we get back, I want to ask you about your updated essay. Why did you go back to Janesville?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

[‘UNHEDGED’ TRAILER PLAYING]

Soumaya Keynes

We are back from the break. So you, after a few years, decided to return to Janesville. What took you there?

Amy Goldstein

Well, I hadn’t been in Janesville since the fall of 2018. That was the last time I had been there. I went back to Janesville this late winter, originally because I was invited to be part of a panel of women authors speaking in Janesville. And when I was preparing to go out there for that event, I just started looking up, well, how is the economy doing now? And I realised that that General Motors site, which was supposed to have been redeveloped by now, was still sitting fallow. There was nothing going on there. And I thought, well, that’s kind of interesting. So when I went out there for a few days, I did so with the idea that maybe I should do some more research and see what this community could tell us about the US economy today, all these years past the Great Recession. So that was my motivation.

Soumaya Keynes

So as well as the plant, how was the local economy doing?

Amy Goldstein

Well, what I found is that the answer to how Janesville’s economy is doing today is quite mixed. On the one hand, it’s recovered by some measures. The unemployment rate, which had shot up to over 13 per cent a few months after the GM plant closed, now has settled back down to where it is in the United States, at a very low level. That was about 3.5 per cent now. So people have jobs. If you look at there’s a kind of nerdy statistic called the labour force participation rate, and that’s, you know, what proportion of people who want to be working are working or looking for jobs. And that rate also looked very healthy. So by a lot of measures, Janesville recovered.

One really important thing that struck me is that manufacturing has not come back. The proportion of jobs in the county that Janesville is the county seat for, that are manufacturing jobs is much lower than it used to be. And partly because General Motors is no longer paying good salaries and providing good benefits. People, on balance, aren’t earning as much as they did back in the, you know, good old General Motors days.

Soumaya Keynes

So why was the plant lying fallow?

Amy Goldstein

Well, it’s kind of a complicated story. The company that bought this property was a company based in St Louis that specialised in rehabilitating old industrial land, and much of it polluted as this land was from all the years of automaking on that property. And they were supposed to find a new owner that would make new use of it. But they discovered that finding a new owner was really, really, really hard. And one of the things that I did was take a look at the context. So I took a look at what happened to the other auto plants, of which there were a bunch that were closed to the United States around the same time, within a year of when the Janesville assembly plant shut down. And it turns out that reusing an old auto plant is a pretty hard thing to do. It takes years, and the odds that’ll be used for automotive purposes again are very low. On the other hand, all the other properties had eventually by now found some new use, and Janesville has not. So it may be its location. The fact that a lot of manufacturing in the United States has moved to the American South, where, it’s less union-friendly terrain, so it’s easier to not pay workers quite as much and not offer them as good benefits. The Upper Midwest is no longer ground zero for the best manufacturing jobs in the United States. So that’s a factor. It’s also a huge property. So the odds that one company is going to want to make use of it all, that’s also a hard thing to pull off. There’s also kind of a bureaucratic fight going on between the state government of Wisconsin and the local government of Janesville over how much environmental clean-up needs to be done. So the state said the company that now owns this land has clean things up enough that it can be used for other industrial purposes. And the city laws disagree with that. So that’s a bit of a deterrent for anybody who wants to come in and reuse this property. So those are some of the reasons.

Soumaya Keynes

Yeah. I mean, it sounds like there are a few things going on there. I mean, in one sense, Janesville is just sounds very unlucky that they got sort of tangled up in this mess of local regulatory disagreement. But then I guess, on the other hand, there does seem to be this broader point about how, you know, I think a lot of the discussion about manufacturing jobs, the idea that there’s a big, big plant means that you’re very specialised, right? You’re not diversified. You’re very reliant on that one employer and actually. That also is sort of the case when it comes to your reliance on a physical space. Like it’s not easy to recover if for whatever reason, you can no longer use that big space for that one thing, you can’t adjust very easily.

Amy Goldstein

That’s right. Other employers have come into the area. I mean, Janesville and the county government have worked very, very hard to recruit new businesses, and they’ve succeeded to some extent. But there are different kinds of work. There’s a big Dollar General — which is like a discount store that has branches all around the United States — distribution centre that’s come in now that doesn’t pay anything like what General Motors wages were, but it’s providing jobs to about 500 people. So there’s been some progress, but there’s still this huge vacancy in the middle of the town.

Soumaya Keynes

Can I just ask a follow up about the point that the wages are down because I was looking at a chart that you put in your update essay that was describing kind of the median household income, inflation-adjusted dollars. I mean, actually, before the pandemic, it looked like it had increased relative to before the recession and recently dipped, I guess, between 2020 and 2022. But, you know, that was a weird time. I guess it’s possible that wages could rebound, I suppose, as a question of, you know, how much is that a weird Covid thing and how much actually has there been a wage increase.

Amy Goldstein

Well, Janesville, I mean, if Janesville was a metaphor during the Great Recession for what happened when work went away, it turns out that Janesville was a pretty good metaphor now for what’s happening with US wages. Because all around the country, wages had been rising in recent years. Obviously, inflation has taken a bite out of that, but they have been going up. And one of the things that I was curious about was how people in Janesville felt about the fact that pay isn’t as good as it used to be. And I asked this question of a number of people, one of whom was an old-time journalist in town, and he said something interesting to me. He said, most people don’t know what used to be was. In other words, most people in the workforce now never worked at General Motors. They’re younger and their expectations may be a little different. And as long as they’re sort of doing OK, it’s OK enough.

Soumaya Keynes

OK, well, look, can I now ask about manufacturing and I guess the special place that manufacturing has in the US political discourse at the moment. So recently on the podcast, we had Adam Posen, who’s the president of the Peterson Institute, your rival think-tank, just across the road from Brookings. And he was very critical of politicians on both sides of the aisle being obsessed with manufacturing. So obviously that’s very important for the Biden administration. But I was also really struck listening to JD Vance, a speech at the Republican National Convention recently where he promised, quote, we’re going to build factories again, put people to work, making real products for American families, made with the hands of American workers. So clearly, you know, it’s very present.

And so my question is, is what you think: do you think there is something special or important about manufacturing jobs specifically? Are they worth trying particularly hard to save?

Amy Goldstein

Well, I think you’re right that the notion of manufacturing, of America as a place that makes things is part of the credo of this country. So there’s something kind of threatening about manufacturing jobs going away. It also is very much aligned with the worries about jobs going offshore. And both parties have a strong goal of bringing back jobs to America. So, you know, I think what Janesville illustrates is that you can have a lot of jobs and people re-employed without them necessarily being as often manufacturing jobs. But that doesn’t take away the kind of psychic role of manufacturing, you know, as connected with the American dream or how this country’s economy, quote, ought to be. As for how realistic either party’s aspirations are, I mean, that will be known in the future.

Soumaya Keynes

Yeah. I mean, I guess in this kind of overall move, you’ve got the US economy moving from manufacturing to services. And, you know, for many, I suppose it seems to be working. Right? I mean, the . . . There are advantages of being more diversified and not being so exposed to these big shocks. But you know, how do people feel about that shift?

Amy Goldstein

You know, as Janesville’s manufacturing identity has attrited, its economy has diversified. And that’s something that people like the county economic development manager, who’s been in his job for a quarter century, very much has wanted to happen. And this is a point on which people disagree in town. There are people who thought that, you know, General Motors was king and the town wouldn’t be the same without it. And there were other people in town who thought that Janesville was too dependent on its auto making history and really would be economically more secure if it brought more different kinds of work into the area. So it’s a debatable point.

Soumaya Keynes

OK, so I have just one final question, which is: do you know what happened to any of the people that you spoke to for the book?

Amy Goldstein

I’ve stayed in touch with a number of people to see how they’re doing and what reflection that has on how the community is doing, and there are different answers. I’ve also been interested in what’s happened to the former GM workers themselves. And let me tell you about Matt Wopat, who is the man who reluctantly became a GM gypsy in Indiana within General Motors. If you work for 30 years, you’re eligible for a pension. Matt was nowhere near that. So to this day, all these years later, he’s doing what he began in 2010, which is getting up on Monday mornings and driving to Indiana and coming back home late, late Friday nights to spend the weekend with his family and turning around and do it all over again. This coming winter, Matt is finally going to reach his 30 years with General Motors, and will be eligible for the pension that his father began to draw the year that General Motors was about to close the plant. So he’s looking forward to finally having life home with his family.

Soumaya Keynes

And so he’s about to retire.

Amy Goldstein

He’s about to retire.

Soumaya Keynes

OK, well, maybe we should retire. On that note, Amy, thank you so much for joining me.

Amy Goldstein

I’ve really enjoyed this.

93c801657d,The Guardian,Familiar faces but not all from politics: meet the surprise Labour ministers | General election 2024 - The Guardian,"When well-known figures from the Labour frontbench made their way into No 10 on Friday to form Keir Starmer’s cabinet, there were few shocks. But since then there have been some surprises among the ranks of new ministers, several of whom are not MPs, and will take up their roles only after receiving peerages. So, who are the prime minister’s most eye-catching new team members?

Richard Hermer KC, attorney general

Hermer’s appointment was arguably Starmer’s most surprising move, as Emily Thornberry had shadowed in the role since 2021.

A human rights barrister at Matrix Chambers, Hermer, 56, has represented Afghan families in a public inquiry into the killing of 80 civilians by the SAS, and acted in inquests raising systemic failings in the custodial system.

But it will be his stance on the conflict in Gaza that will be most closely watched. Hermer has stated clearly that it is “almost impossible to conceive” how an Israeli siege that denied civilians food and water could be in compliance with international law.

He was one of several high-profile Jewish lawyers to call for Israel to be guided by the law in its response to the Hamas attacks on 7 October. Harmer warned Labour that the boycott, divestment, sanctions bill, designed to ban public bodies from boycotting Israel and other countries, would have “a profoundly detrimental impact on the UK’s ability to protect and promote human rights overseas”.

Hermer was described by his colleague Matthew Ryder as “a superb lawyer who will bring experience, judgement and legal acumen to the role”.

Sir Patrick Vallance, science minister

Vallance is perhaps the most familiar new face among Keir Starmer’s “goats” (government of all the talents). He will serve as a science minister in the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, under the secretary of state, Peter Kyle.

Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser from 2018 to 2023, became a household name during the Covid pandemic, appearing at televised briefings almost daily for a time.

At the Covid inquiry in November last year, Vallance, 64, argued that lockdown should have come sooner and revealed that Boris Johnson’s grasp of science was weak. His appointment has sparked criticism from lockdown sceptics. Richard Tice, the chairman of Reform UK and the new MP for Boston and Skegness, said it was “a major conflict of interest and as such it’s disgraceful”.

James Timpson, prisons minister

The appointment of the rehabilitation campaigner and businessman – Timpson stores are best known for shoe repairs, key cutting and dry cleaning – has created a flurry of interest and has been hailed by prison reformers.

More than 10% of Timpson’s workforce are former prisoners, while the company has an “upside-down” management style where the 5,600 employees are in charge (it also gives workers a paid day off on their birthdays and use of the company limousine on their wedding day).

Timpson, 52, has argued that only a third of prisoners should definitely be in custody, saying in a TV interview earlier this year that “the UK is addicted to sentencing and punishment”, and arguing that systems in countries such as the Netherlands which use more community sentencing have lower reoffending rates.

Responding to the news, the best-selling author known as the Secret Barrister wrote on X: “This has the potential to be an absolutely incredible appointment. I need to sit down.”

Jacqui Smith, higher education minister

Smith is one of two former cabinet ministers who served under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown to have been given junior ministerial roles by Starmer. The former home secretary, who was the first woman to hold that role, will join the House of Lords to become higher education minister – a role she first held 25 years ago.

In 2009, Smith became the first cabinet minister to quit directly because of the expenses scandal after it was revealed that she had claimed for a pornographic movie apparently seen by her husband, and designated her sister’s property in London as her main home, instead of her family home in Redditch.

After losing her seat in the 2010 election, she competed on Strictly Come Dancing and co-hosted a political podcast with the Conservative broadcaster Iain Dale. She was chair of the University Hospitals Birmingham trust and since 2021 has been chair of Barts health trust in London.

Smith, 61, has also forged a career in public affairs, joining Westbourne Communications in 2015 and Higginson Strategy in 2019 as chair of its new women’s practice, Empower.

Douglas Alexander, trade minister

The former Scottish secretary, who returned as an MP on Friday, was made trade minister by Starmer within hours. An MP for Paisley and Renfrewshire South from 1997, he had been defeated by the SNP’s Mhairi Black, then just 20, in 2015.","A man in a suit stands in front of a flag, likely the UK flag, with the Guardian logo in the bottom right corner.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BDA709F60>,2024-07-07 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/07/familiar-faces-but-not-all-from-politics-meet-the-surprise-labour-ministers,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Unlikely,Likely,sample_review/images/93c801657d.png
4c82a7aa1f,Financial Times,How Bill Ackman’s $25bn IPO dream unravelled - Financial Times,"Bill Ackman descended on downtown Omaha in early May for what UBS billed as a “special fireside chat”.

It was an opportunity to get Ackman and his partner Ryan Israel in front of the kinds of investors who had stuck with Warren Buffett for decades, investors who might be interested in the pair’s soon-to-be listed closed-end fund, Pershing Square USA.

The following day, Buffett himself would be taking the main stage across the street, with tens of thousands of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders — not to mention corporate chieftains including Citi’s Jane Fraser and Apple’s Tim Cook — flying in for the Oracle of Omaha’s annual general meeting.

An adoring crowd met Ackman at the UBS event. The billionaire would later say that he hoped to one day have an annual meeting in the same vein as Buffett’s: drawing large crowds and having the floor to wax on business and investment.

In characteristic boldness from Ackman, he planned to do it through one of the largest ever public listings — with plans to raise $25bn through Pershing Square USA — a lofty ambition for any company, let alone a fund whose structure has fallen out of favour with investors.

But the billionaire investor wanted to make Pershing Square USA a huge player in US capital markets. The fund could act as an anchor investor to another Pershing vehicle which would help companies like SpaceX and Stripe go public, while throwing its weight behind undervalued large-cap companies.

The public listing of the US vehicle was also part of a bigger scheme. It would be a precursor to an eventual blockbuster IPO of Ackman’s hedge fund — Pershing Square Capital Management, the entity that would manage his other funds — as soon as 2025, according to a person familiar with the plans.

Over the past week, that grand vision came crashing down.

Ackman pulled the IPO of Pershing Square USA on Wednesday after a startling series of setbacks, as the company slashed its fundraising target from $25bn, to $4bn, and then finally to $2bn — before yanking it entirely.

“I made the decision to withdraw the IPO this morning when I came up with a better transaction structure,” Ackman posted on social media platform X on Wednesday. “We were scheduled to price the offering this coming Monday, but we changed course this morning.”

As the IPO roadshow unfolded over the past three weeks, investors’ concerns started to emerge. Some worried that the initial $25bn target was far too large, and that the shares would trade at a discount after going public — similar to other closed-end funds, including Pershing Square’s own London and Amsterdam-listed entity.

The proposed listing was dealt a hammer blow last week when Ackman sent a letter to investors in his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, in which he said that the listing was on track to raise as much as 90 per cent less than originally anticipated.

“Bill is a once in a generation” talent, one equity investor in Ackman’s hedge fund said. But he added his “hyper honesty” about his tremendous fundraising aspirations proved to be his undoing. “The $25bn anchoring became so widely known that . . . if they only raised $2bn or $1bn everyone was going to say this is a failure,” he said.

Worse, Ackman acknowledged a number of investor concerns, including that the stock would not trade well after the IPO, saying that it required a “significant leap of faith” for investors to believe that the company would trade at a premium when “very few in history have done so”.

It was intended as a private email to partners, but his lawyers advised him that it had to be disclosed under SEC rules as part of the IPO process. The letter — and investors’ worries — spilled out into the open.

“I was shocked they did anything other than just pull it,” a senior banker at one of Pershing’s top underwriters said after the letter had been made public. “What a shitshow.”

The collapse of the public listing was presaged by the withdrawal of Boston-based hedge fund Baupost Group, which Ackman said in the letter had committed $150mn. After the letter was publicly disclosed, Baupost — whose chief executive Seth Klarman is notoriously private — decided against backing the listing.

As reports of Baupost’s decision to sit on the sidelines were made public, the air rapidly came out of the listing, and the banks leading the offering — a group that includes Citi, UBS, Bank of America and Jefferies — knew they had a problem. Anchor investors rarely drop out on the precipice of an IPO, which can sap demand from other would-be buyers.

Its public disclosure “slowed the momentum he had in the deal,” said David Erickson, a senior fellow at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and the former head of equity capital markets at Barclays.

“Sometimes following your bankers who have done lots of IPOs is probably the right way to approach it, as opposed to what’s always been successful for you,” he said, adding that the letter was “too much communication” and probably raised more concerns than it assuaged. “It’s a different process from raising private capital.”

Conversations with a dozen investors, capital allocators and bankers reveal that the IPO failed to create enough buzz in the institutional investor community. A sticking point among investors was the structure of the fund, which seemed to benefit Ackman but arguably did not reward early investors.

Pershing Square and Baupost declined to comment.

As a closed-end fund, the listing would be made up of permanent capital, meaning that it would be difficult for investors to redeem their shares at net asset value like a normal fund, instead forcing them to sell if they want to get their money back. The benefit would be that Ackman could hold stocks longer than a traditional hedge fund, without facing investor pressure to sell.

But such funds tend to trade at a discount to their net-asset value, which can disincentivise investors from placing stock orders before they go public.

Before the IPO fell apart, Ackman had been steadily rising in prominence. While he was always well-known on Wall Street, the social media celebrity he garnered in recent months propelled him to be known on Main Street, too. He told investors that his “notoriety” on social media would benefit the US listing.

After war broke out between Israel and Hamas in October last year, Ackman redirected his activist tactics — a skill he had honed for years as an investor — towards university presidents who he viewed as failing to do enough for Jewish students.

His lobbying efforts contributed to the resignation of Harvard University president Claudine Gay and University of Pennsylvania president Elizabeth Magill. His number of followers on X swelled.

As he courted controversy, he became increasingly convinced that his fame would boost his business dealings. The large discount between assets held by his Pershing Square Holdings vehicle seemed to be closing, with two people close to him arguing that his celebrity had driven investor interest to the fund.

There was some evidence of that. In June, he successfully sold a 10 per cent stake in his hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, which manages investments for his different vehicles, for $1.05bn. The deal attracted an eclectic group of investors, including San Francisco-based Iconiq Capital and Israeli insurance company Menora Mivtachim.

Still, some institutional investors were unconvinced. Since they could already get exposure to Ackman at a discount through Pershing Square Holdings, it made sense to wait and see how the US vehicle traded once it listed. They could potentially pick up shares later at a discount.

“The issue with a closed-end fund is that if it trades at a premium from IPO, then management tends to issue equity to deal with that excess demand,” said Kier Boley, the CIO of alternative investment solutions at Swiss private bank UBP. “But when sentiment turns and investors wish to exit, the fund trades at a discount and then tends to remain at this new discount range.”

Ackman is not finished yet. The billionaire is already working on a new vehicle to address investor concerns about how the US fund was structured. “He’s smart and creative so I’m sure there will be a workaround,” one banker involved in the deal said on Wednesday, shortly after the proposed listing was pulled.

While the US fund will not start trading in the coming week as planned, a cousin of that plan — something that “democratiz[es] access to the Pershing Square strategy” as Ackman once described the IPO — could emerge in a different form.

Ackman said in a video for investors on the roadshow this summer: “We hope someday 30 years from now people will be sitting at the Pershing Square USA shareholder meeting . . . and that their investment will have made a big difference for their family.”

f7705a8f2d,National Post,Opinion: Court's dismissal of antisemitism at U of T encampment a slap in the face - National Post,"Article content

Despite being among its biggest supporters, the Jewish community often finds itself on the losing side when it comes to the University of Toronto. For two decades, we have fought against the university allowing Israeli Apartheid Week events to be held on campus, which has fostered generations of antisemites and normalized anti-Israel sentiment on campus, even among some faculty and administrators.

The university has opposed the Jewish community at every turn, including by hosting radical speakers who promoted the boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign against Israel and accused the Jewish state of every falsehood imaginable. When it came to adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, a committee appointed by the administration rejected it.

The situation escalated with the encampment set up by pro-Hamas sympathizers who demanded the university divest from any investments related to Israel and sever ties with the only Jewish state. These sympathizers, while hiding behind free speech, audaciously called for the school to cut ties with Israeli academics and universities. Worse, they barred pro-Zionist students and faculty from entering their encampment (on university property) and lined its fence with violence-promoting slogans targeting Israel.

The final straw, however, came this week, when Judge Markus Koehnen of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice dismissed the Jewish community’s concerns over antisemitism. Many interlocutors quickly applauded the injunction to dismantle the encampment, failing to understand the damage. The verdict was a win for the University of Toronto’s property rights but a terrible, unprecedented legal loss for the Jewish community.

In his judgment, Judge Koehnen admitted that, “There can be no doubt that some of the speech on the exterior of the encampment rises to the level of hate speech.” Among many examples, he cited comments like, “We need another holocost (sic),” “Death To the Jews, Hamas for Prime Minister” and “you dirty fu–ing Jew. Go back to Europe.’ ” Despite the encampment fostering this hate speech, the judge took a more sympathetic tone towards those occupying the encampment, stating that, “None of the named respondents and none of the encampment occupants have been associated with any of these statements.”

Judge Koehnen claimed that the “automatic conclusion that those phrases are antisemitic is not justified.” He appeared to dismiss key antisemitic indicators, including “a photograph of the university president (who is Jewish), which was described as depicting the president as a devil with the caption ‘blood on your hands’ in bold letters beneath,” the “inverted triangle” which Hamas uses to mark its targets, along with the phrases “intifada,” “Free Palestine by any means necessary” and “From the river to the sea,” which is often condemned as a call for the genocide of the Jewish people.

It’s important to exemplify how outrageous and damaging the ruling is, so that we have better representation in the future. Judge Koehnen wrote: “There was considerable debate in the record about the use of certain slogans such as ‘from the river to the sea,’ ‘glory to the martyrs’ and the word ‘intifada.’ A number of intervenors asked me to find those phrases to be antisemitic. I accept that these expressions are perceived as hurtful and threatening to many Jews. There appears, however, to be considerable variation, nuance and context around the meaning of these terms which, in my mind, would make it improper to automatically assume that they are antisemitic, especially on an interlocutory motion.”

Judge Koehnen wrongly surmised that part of the problem “arises out of the absence of an agreed definition of antisemitism.” He rationalized part of this assessment by stating that the university itself refused to adopt the definitions advanced by some organizations — meaning the IHRA working definition of antisemitism, the most accepted definition on the planet. Had the university not thrown the Jewish community under the bus, Judge Koehnen’s rationale might have been different.

Given that Jews face a disproportionate amount of hate, the way this judgment dismissed claims of antisemitism is highly concerning. After this debacle, what our community requires is more and better legal representation. The only thing standing against antisemitism in Canada is the rule of law and skilled lawyers and prosecutors taking cases against egregious offenders who abuse the right to protest by using hateful speech, threatening others and vandalizing places of worship.

2920d86986,Financial Times,Russian reinforcements fail to push back Ukrainian incursion - Financial Times,"Russia has failed to push back Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region despite sending in reinforcements as the incursion enters its sixth day, Ukrainian soldiers involved in its army’s operation told the Financial Times on Sunday.

Speaking near the international border, the troops said they remained in Russian territory.

Russian general Valery Gerasimov has repeatedly attempted to portray the situation as being under control, with the defence ministry posting videos on Sunday of fighter jets and helicopters purportedly striking columns of Ukrainian equipment.

But verified videos and photographs show Ukrainian troops and equipment have advanced 30km inside Russia since the operation began on Tuesday, moving further into Kursk and occupying the town of Sudzha near the Russian border.

“We are going deeper,” said Denys, a Ukrainian soldier who has made three rotations into Russian territory since the incursion began. Kyiv’s troops still had the upper hand despite Russia bringing in reinforcements, he added, as a Ukrainian fighter jet zoomed overhead.

His unit, which the FT is not identifying at the request of Denys and his senior officers, had been rotated to the area from the eastern Donetsk region more than a week ago to take part in the offensive.

Another soldier, Kostyantyn, said the early success of the surprise operation had “really lifted our spirits”. “We feel confident of Ukrainian victory,” he added, before driving back into the fight.

Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy broke five days of silence on Saturday night to refer to his forces’ incursion into Russia publicly for the first time.

Zelenskyy said his commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi had reported to him about “the frontline situation and on our actions to push the war out into the aggressor’s territory”.

“Ukraine is proving that it really knows how to restore justice and guarantees exactly the kind of pressure that is needed — pressure on the aggressor,” he added.

A Ukrainian defence ministry official told the FT that they were being tight-lipped on details of the operation because they were “waiting to see how it develops first”.

Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova vowed on Sunday that there would be a “tough response” to the incursion.

The country’s defence ministry said it “continues to repel” Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region and on Sunday listed three settlements located about 25km-30km from the border — Tolpino, Zhuravli and Obshchii Kolodez — where it said it had struck Ukrainian troops.

Russia has deployed tank crews, artillery guns and drone units to the region after the Kremlin announced a “counter-terrorism” operation to try to halt the unprecedented Ukrainian operation.

The Russian defence ministry said more than a dozen Ukrainian drones and four missiles in the Kursk region had been shot down overnight on Saturday. A missile struck an apartment block in Kursk city on Saturday, injuring 13 people, its governor Alexey Smirnov said. Ukraine has not commented on the attack.

More than 76,000 civilians have also been evacuated from the Kursk border region. Smirnov referred to the Ukrainian forces as sabotage and reconnaissance groups, and said they had caused panic. “The situation is stable but very difficult,” he added.

The regional government in Ukraine’s nearby Sumy region has also evacuated several thousand people since Tuesday. About 50 arrived at an aid centre for internally displaced people on Sunday morning, where they were to receive food and financial assistance.

Anatoliy and his wife Nadiya said they had fled their cottage in the Ukrainian village of Khotin, where Russian forces have dropped devastating glide bombs.

They said they supported their military’s incursion. “Why can Russians invade us but we can’t invade them?” Nadiya asked.

The ultimate aim of Ukraine’s incursion — which is using some of its best and most elite brigades — remains unclear. But the operation has demonstrated that Russia’s border defences are still weak more than a year after Ukraine’s first mini-incursion and has given Kyiv a much-needed morale boost.

Analysts have said Ukraine may be seeking to use the Kursk offensive to improve its position in potential talks. It is losing territory and men in eastern Ukraine and is still struggling to resolve ammunition and manpower shortages.

Videos posted by Ukrainian troops on Saturday showed them joyously hoisting the Ukrainian flag on a Russian village council building and allegedly telling residents to get ready for a referendum — both tactics often used by Russian forces in Ukraine. Several dozen captured Russian soldiers were also filmed being driven into Ukraine.

501dc8e512,The Globe and Mail,One of the deadliest Russian strikes so far leaves at least 51 Ukrainians dead - The Globe and Mail,"At least 51 people were killed when a pair of Russian missiles slammed into a military training facility in the central Ukrainian city of Poltava on Tuesday, one of the deadliest incidents in 2½ years of war.

The missiles hit the courtyard of the Military Institute of Telecommunications and Information Technologies, a training centre for signals officers, who specialize in radar and electronic warfare. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said 271 people were injured, and Philip Pronin, the governor of the Poltava region, said “up to 18 people” were still trapped beneath the rubble as dusk fell.

Many of the victims were believed to be soldiers or cadets. The Ukrainian military released a statement saying there were “dozens dead and hundreds injured,” adding, “We lost brave Ukrainians, our brothers and sisters, soldiers.”

Photographs posted to social media showed a deep crater in front of a seven-storey building, the façade of which had been largely torn off by the force of the blast. In Soviet times, the institute was called the Higher Military Command School of Communications. It would have been a site well known to the Russian military. Ten other buildings, including a nearby hospital, were also damaged.

In a video message issued shortly after the attack, Mr. Zelensky said he had ordered “a full and prompt investigation into all of the circumstances of what happened.” He also vowed “the Russian scum will surely pay for this strike.”

Mr. Zelensky repeated his call for Ukraine’s Western allies to supply it with more air-defence weapons and to allow Ukraine to use Western-supplied weapons to strike targets inside Russia, including the bases from which the long-range Iskander ballistic missiles used in Tuesday’s attack can be launched. “Every day of delay, unfortunately, means more lost lives,” he said.

He later wrote on Telegram that he had spoken Tuesday with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who had expressed his condolences for the attack on Poltava. Mr. Zelensky said they had discussed Ukraine’s defence needs, “including additional air defense systems and armored vehicles.”

In a separate statement, the Ukrainian military said the rockets arrived so quickly after the city’s air-raid siren sounded that “it caught people at the moment of evacuation to the bomb shelter.” Poltava, a city of 300,000 people located far from the front lines, had been viewed as a relatively safe region until Tuesday.

Russian military bloggers claimed the victims had been assembled outside for a ceremony marking the start of the academic year when the missiles struck.

That was denied by the Ukrainian military. “There was no parade or any other event at the time of the airstrike.”

Mr. Pronin declared three days of official mourning and called for Ukrainians to donate blood to help those injured in the strike. “This is a stunning tragedy for all of Ukraine. The enemy hit an educational institution and a hospital,” Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, wrote on social media.

The incident recalled previous Russian strikes on military facilities that inflicted mass casualties on grouped Ukrainian soldiers or cadets, including a strike last year on a medal ceremony in the southern Zaporizhzhia region that left 19 soldiers dead. Another one, early in the war, struck the Yavoriv training base in western Ukraine, killing 64, including some foreign volunteers.

The deadliest incident involving Ukrainian soldiers occurred in May, 2022, when 87 were killed at a training base in the northern Chernihiv region.

Yuriy Butusov, a prominent Ukrainian military journalist, said it is now standard practice for award ceremonies and other such events to be held in small groups – no larger than 30 or 40 – and usually in bunkers or other discreet locations. Writing on Facebook, Mr. Butusov argued that there was no justification for upward of 200 troops to be gathered outside a known military facility “for some event” that had obviously been spotted by the Russian side. He predicted that the tragedy in Poltava would be repeated unless the Ukrainian officers responsible for organizing the event were punished with “loss of rank and a real prison term.”

The deadly blast is the latest in a surge of Russian air attacks since Ukrainian troops crossed into the Kursk region of Russia one month ago Tuesday. Though Russian forces have yet to mount a substantial counteroffensive in Kursk – where Ukraine claims to control around 1,300 square kilometres – Kyiv and other cities have been pounded with some of the largest missile and drone barrages since the start of the war. Meanwhile, Russian troops have kept up their grinding offensive in Ukraine’s southeastern Donbas region, where they are approaching the outskirts of the strategic city of Pokrovsk.

Tuesday’s attack came as Russian President Vladimir Putin made an official visit to Mongolia, which received him with a guard of honour, despite an outstanding warrant from the International Criminal Court for his arrest for the alleged war crime of overseeing the deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia. Mongolia, a member of the ICC, ignored a Ukrainian request to arrest the Russian leader.","A damaged building with emergency responders inside, with a visible hole in the wall and debris scattered around.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x145 at 0x7D6B7EC025F0>,2024-09-03 12:53:42.463000+00:00,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-at-least-51-ukrainians-killed-in-one-of-deadliest-russian-strikes-of/,['International' 'Politics'],[0.9 0.7],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/501dc8e512.png
79d6dae327,ABC News,"Latest fatal landslide in Alaska kills 1 and injures 3 in Ketchikan, a popular cruise ship stop - ABC News","JUNEAU, Alaska -- A landslide cut a path down a steep, thickly forested hillside and crashed into several homes in Ketchikan, killing one person and injuring three in the latest such disaster to strike mountainous southeast Alaska.

The landslide Sunday afternoon prompted a mandatory evacuation of 60 nearby homes in the city, a popular cruise ship stop along the famed Inside Passage in the Alaska panhandle. The slope remained unstable Monday, and authorities said that state and local geologists were arriving to assess the potential for further slides.

Four homes were critically damaged, officials said, and homes next to the slide area were still being assessed. Several homes and businesses reported flooding.

Last November, six people — including a family of five — were killed when a landslide destroyed two homes in Wrangell, about 100 miles (161 kilometers) to the north. Torrential rains were blamed for landslides that killed two people in Haines in 2020 and three people in Sitka in 2015.

“In my 65 years in Ketchikan, I have never seen a slide of this magnitude,"" Ketchikan Mayor Dave Kiffer said in a statement. “With the slides we have seen across the region, there is clearly a region-wide issue that we need to try to understand with the support of our State geologist.”

He said the loss of life was “heartbreaking, and my heart goes out to those who lost their homes.”

Ketchikan officials on Monday identified the victim as Sean Griffin, a 17-year veteran of the city’s public works team who was clearing stormwater drains with a co-worker when they were caught in the landslide.

“It was his commitment to the community that caused him to respond to the call for assistance during his scheduled time off,” a statement from Ketchikan Gateway Borough Clerk Kacie Paxton said.

The landslide followed a weekend bout of rain amid an abnormally dry August, said Andrew Park, a meteorologist in Juneau with the National Weather Service. The weather service early Monday said Ketchikan had received about 2.6 inches (66 millimeters) of rain in about 36 hours, though rainfall totals at higher elevations nearby ranged from 5 to 9 inches (127 to 229 millimeters).

Landslides can be unpredictable, but this one occurred without certain other risk factors, such as high winds, Park said.

“There weren’t any of the big red flags we would normally see,” he said.

Leah Canfield was trying to nap when the slide struck. She saw a flash of light — she initially thought lightning, but it was likely an electrical conductor exploding, she said — and then her house started rumbling. She woke her spouse, and they grabbed their dogs and headed outside.

“When we started coming down the stairs, we’ve seen that, you know, there’s a lot of debris that was flying around outside our office window and realized, you know, that this is probably much bigger than just an earthquake,” she said.

They found that their neighbor’s home had plunged downhill, part of it coming to rest in their front yard. Another two-story house next door partially collapsed and slid into a different home, knocking it off its foundation. Trees, debris and a telephone pole landed on the roof of Canfield’s home, but Canfield said she believed the house could be salvaged.

After calling family members to let them know they were OK, they walked about 20 minutes to a hotel, because their pickup truck was buried by uprooted trees.

Ketchikan is surrounded by the Tongass National Forest, a temperate rainforest that encompasses much of southeast Alaska. Landslides strike often in the region, but garner little notice when they hit remote, unpopulated areas.

But as climate change intensifies storms and destabilizes soil, they are posing more risk to communities.

Because of the steep terrain, there's limited room for development in the region, and cities and roads are built at the base of slopes. Increasingly, landslides are occurring in inhabited areas of “old infrastructure that’s been built in harm’s way,"" said Aaron Jacobs, a meteorologist and senior service hydrologist with the National Weather Service’s Juneau office.

“It’s just becoming more and more common that they’re impacting people,” Jacobs said.

Jacobs planned to travel to Ketchikan on Monday to study the soil composition in the area and try to pinpoint why it occurred when the area had been in a period of drought before the weekend’s rainfall.

“We’re going to learn more about this and hopefully we can figure out what caused it and then we can move forward on it,” he said.

Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy declared an emergency for Ketchikan, while Kiffer and Ketchikan Gateway Borough Mayor Rodney Dial issued a separate emergency declaration. A shelter was set up at Ketchikan High School.

Two of the victims in Ketchikan were admitted to the hospital and one was treated and released. All other individuals were accounted for, the city and borough said in a joint statement.

Michael Robbins, the superintendent of schools in Ketchikan, said in a statement on social media that a dozen people were staying at the shelter at the local high school as of Monday morning.

But people often stay with friends or relatives after such events, so it remained unknown how many were displaced.

Power was restored to some of the area by 8:15 p.m. Sunday. Other areas will remain without power while the landslide is cleared and broken power poles are replaced.

Landslides include debris flows often triggered by heavy rains. When logging or fire destroys trees, the loss of root structure can weaken soil. Rain that isn’t being sucked up by plants can saturate the ground, making it more likely to slide. Other types include creeps, which move slowly downward, and rock falls.

In Alaska, melting permafrost, retreating glaciers, earthquakes and pounding rains can all trigger landslides.

Good morning. I'm Taylor Wilson and today is Thursday, June 13th, 2024. This is The Excerpt.

Today House Republicans have voted to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress, plus Oklahoma Supreme Court dismisses a lawsuit from survivors of the 1921 Tulsa Race massacre. And a Florida school board bans a book about book bans.

♦

House Republicans voted yesterday to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress. It marked a dramatic escalation of the GOP's broader war against the Biden administration's Justice Department. I spoke with USA TODAY, Congress reporter Ken Tran for more. Ken, thanks for making the time.

Ken Tran:

Thanks for having me.

Taylor Wilson:

So Ken, what did House Republicans decide here around holding Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress?

Ken Tran:

So on Wednesday, House Republicans voted in the afternoon to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress as retaliation against the Department of Justice for withholding the audio recordings of President Joe Biden's interview with special counsel Robert Hur. House Republicans have been asking for the audio recordings for a while now, but the DOJ has refused, saying that the Justice Department has already provided Republicans all that they need for any investigative needs, such as the transcripts, for example.

Taylor Wilson:

And was anything surprising about the vote and how it came out?

Ken Tran:

There was a lot of tension leading up to the vote. There was a lot of consternation about the moderate Republicans who were a little skeptical about picking another fight with the Department of Justice since the party already has been taking aim at the US Justice system for multiple reasons, accusing it of being politicized and targeting conservatives. But at the end of the day, all the Republicans in the house did vote for the contempt resolution besides one, Rep. David Joyce of Ohio, one of the many moderates that were skeptical. He said that he couldn't, in good conscience, support something that would again further politicize the justice system.

Taylor Wilson:

So you mentioned the skeptical moderate there. How are other opponents responding, thinking Democrats? And have we heard from Garland himself?

Ken Tran:

So Garland went after Republicans for politicizing the justice system, over and over again. He's reiterated this. He said that Republicans are playing dangerous games and making the justice system appear something that it's not. And Democrats have argued the same. They've echoed Garland's sentiments, saying that Republicans are just seeking to score political points. But they've also agreed with the Department of Justice that they've already provided Republicans with all they need. They already have the transcripts from the interview. So providing the audio recording wouldn't do much because the transcripts already offer the exact words and what was said in that interview.

Taylor Wilson:

So Ken, what does this now functionally mean really, for Garland going forward?

Ken Tran:

So the resolution includes a referral to the US attorney of the District of Columbia for criminal prosecution. That is almost certainly not going to happen. Instead, this resolution will likely end up in a court fight. Republicans are hoping that this will help them sue the Department of Justice so they can get the audio recordings forcefully. That will be a very long court battle that we don't expect to wrap up anytime soon. Probably not before election day.

Taylor Wilson:

All right. Ken Tran covers Congress for USA TODAY. Thanks Ken.

Ken Tran:

Thanks.

Taylor Wilson:

Southern Baptist yesterday condemned the use of in vitro fertilization or IVF. Southern Baptist Convention delegates known as ""messengers,"" at this year's annual meeting in Indianapolis, approved a resolution criticizing IVF, calling on Southern Baptist to only support reproductive technologies that affirm the ""unconditional value and right to life of every human being, including those in an embryonic stage."" The resolution reinforces an increasingly popular stance among anti-abortion groups following an Alabama Supreme Court ruling in February. The court said frozen embryos are legally considered children and are protected under the state's Wrongful Death of a Minor Act, a ruling that sparked national debate. Debate on the floor of the convention over the resolution, showed divisions within the nation's largest Protestant denomination, over the issue. The statement is the first of its kind for the SBC, but could reverberate across other conservative denominations. Also, yesterday the Southern Baptist Convention rejected a ban on women pastors, a major victory for those seeking to maintain local church autonomy and soften what many considered growing antagonism toward women in ministry.

♦

The Oklahoma Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit yesterday from remaining survivors of the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, who sought reparations. Survivors Viola, Fletcher, Lessie Benningfield Randall and Hughes Van Ellis initially filed the suit in 2020 against the city of Tulsa and other departments and officials. The suit said the massacre represented an ongoing public nuisance, and that in 2016 the defendants began enriching themselves by promoting the site of the massacre as a tourist attraction. Van Ellis died last year at the age of 102. The incident was one of the worst single acts of violence against black people in U.S. history. In the early 1900s, the 40 blocks to the north of Downtown Tulsa boasted successful black businesses and residents. On May 31st and June 1st, 1921, a white mob descended on Greenwood, the black section of Tulsa, burning, looting and destroying more than 1000 homes. The true death toll of the massacre may never be known with the search for unmarked graves continuing more than a century later, but most historians who have studied the event, estimate the depth toll to be between 75 and 300 people.

♦

The Federal Reserve kept its key interest rate unchanged again yesterday, and scaled back its forecast from three rate cuts to just one this year, after an inflation pickup in early 2024. The outlook will likely disappoint markets that figured the Fed would forecast two cuts after an encouraging report earlier in the day showed inflation slowing more than expected. In a statement after a two-day meeting, the central bank acknowledged a resumption of at least some gains in its battle to tame inflation that has concerned Americans the past three years.

A ban on a book about banning books. The School Board in Indian River County, Florida, voted it off the shelves. I spoke with USA TODAY Network Florida First Amendment reporter, Douglas Soule, to find out more. Douglas, thanks for making the time today.

Douglas Soule:

Thanks for having me on.

Taylor Wilson:

So Douglas, let's just start with this. What is this book and what did the school board decide here?

Douglas Soule:

So the book in question is called ""Ban This Book"". It's a children's novel that follows a fictional fourth grader who creates a secret banned book's locker library after her school board pulled a multitude of titles off the shelves, including her own favorite book. Now the school board of Indian River County in Florida decided in a 3-2 vote to remove it from its school libraries, going against the decision of its own district book-review committee. It was previously in two elementary schools and a middle school.

Taylor Wilson:

Yeah. So Douglas, what do supporters and opponents say of the decision here?

Douglas Soule:

The objector of the book is Jennifer Pippin, the leader of the local chapter of Moms for Liberty. Moms for Liberty is a national conservative group that has become the loudest voice promoting school book removals of books its members deem are inappropriate. Now, Pippin's Challenge accused the book of containing sexual conduct. The school board members and members of the public who wanted to keep the books on the shelves disagreed with that, saying it only listed books, some of which had already been removed from school shelves, including in Indian River County itself. The supporters of the book also expressed reservations about the school board going against the decision of its own review committee.

Now, Alan Gratz, the author, called The decision ""incredibly ironic."" Opponents of the book took big issue though with it referencing books that had been removed. They also accused the title of teaching rebellion of school board authority. One school board member even accused it of being a liberal Marxist propaganda piece.

Taylor Wilson:

Wow. So what led up to this point Douglas? Can you help us just put this moment in context?

Douglas Soule:

So to put this moment in context for Indian River County, I think you really do have to look statewide, because Indian River County and its school district is not the only place that's seeing book removals in the State of Florida. Multiple measures signed by Governor Ron DeSantis have prompted local school board leaders and school district leaders across the state to pull books in wildly varying ways, fearing running afoul of state law. It's also prompted multiple lawsuits. Now in Indian River County, more than 140 books have been removed from school shelves. That's according to a list I obtained through a public records request. Interestingly, Moms for Liberty's Pippin, who filed the objection had also filed the objections for those more than 140 books. And those removed titles in Indian River County also include classics like ""The Bluest Eye"", ""Slaughterhouse-Five"" and ""Kite Runner"".

Taylor Wilson:

So as you say, Douglas, really these debates over book bans are not going anywhere. What's next for this conversation around book bans in Florida, going forward?

Douglas Soule:

It's kind of hard to say. I'm certain these conversations and these controversies will continue. A law will be taking effect soon that will limit how many books non-student parents can challenge. So it'll be interesting to see the results of that, especially since a lot of the book challenges from across the state are coming from only a few people, though people like Pippin who challenged ""Ban This Book"" are parents themselves. There's also litigation to look out for. For example, in two lawsuits, Florida and [inaudible 00:09:45] are arguing that book removals, regardless of reason, are protected government speech. So how judges eventually rule on that could have big implications.

Taylor Wilson:

48dfbf71e3,The New York Times,Is New Haven the Pizza Capital of the U.S.? ‘They’re Outta Their Minds.’ - The New York Times,"Salvatore Carlino knows what it takes to make the perfect New York slice: He grew up in his parents’ pizza shop, Papa Leone, in Brooklyn’s Sheepshead Bay, and now owns his own pizzeria, Lucia, with locations in Brooklyn and Manhattan.

So when a New York Times reporter called to inform him that a member of Congress planned to declare New Haven, Conn., and not New York City, the pizza capital of the United States on the House floor, Mr. Carlino’s response was swift.

“This has to be a prank call,” he said, insisting. Twice.

“Oh, no,” Frank Tuttolomondo, who owns Mama’s Too in Manhattan, said when he learned of the effort. “No way; they’re outta their minds.”

But in fact, Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut on Wednesday read a statement into the Congressional Record that declared New Haven to have “the best pizza in the country,” she said in a news release earlier this week. “It’s not even close.”

New Haven pizzerias have made the area “one of the most respected and recognized pizza meccas and destinations in the country,” the Congressional Record statement reads, adding that the family businesses have been “a foundational stone of our community and an economic driver for more than a century.”

Created by coal-fired brick ovens, New Haven’s signature dish is known as “apizza,” pronounced “ah-beetz,” with roots in Naples. The most famous pizzerias include Frank Pepe’s, established in 1925; Sally’s, which dates to 1938; and Modern Apizza, which dates back to 1934.

Together they are known locally as the Big Three, and their owners went to the Capitol on Wednesday, part of a delegation of more than 100 Connecticut pizza makers, legislators, veterans and community leaders on hand to witness what many of them described as a historic moment for New Haven pizza.

“New Haven and Connecticut have been an epicenter of expert pizza making for more than a century,” Colin Caplan, who leads New Haven pizza walking tours and co-produced a New Haven pizza documentary, said in a statement this week. “There’s a level of pizza alchemy taking place in this area surpassed by nowhere else.”

New Haven is home to more than 75 pizza-making establishments, according to Ms. DeLauro’s office. In comparison, a New York City Health Department database shows 1,610 pizza operations across the five boroughs.

While Ms. DeLauro’s statement was largely symbolic, the very thought of Connecticut doing anything better than New York struck a nerve among pizzaiolos and New Yorkers alike. This was particularly sensitive given that many believe New York City is home to the nation’s first pizzeria. The offices of New York City Council and the state both weighed in through their social media accounts.

Mr. Tuttolomondo, the Mama’s Too owner, said that he’s had New Haven style pizza once, but it was cold so he couldn’t give a fair review.

Still, Mr. Tuttolomondo said he recognized that pizza is a personal experience.

“Pizza in general, there’s nostalgia involved, there’s memories,” he said. “You could go to one place and it could be the best place in the world. If you had your first slice of pizza at Pizza Hut it could resonate with you in a certain way.”

Paul Giannone, who owns Paulie Gee’s in Greenpoint, took a diplomatic approach.

“There is no capital,” he said. “Washington is a political town, and you’re talking to a pizza politician.”

While pizza styles are “a matter of taste,” he did add that New Haven isn’t even his favorite place for pizza in Connecticut. That would be Zuppardi’s, in neighboring West Haven, which makes a great fresh clam pie, he said.

“We got the best,” Victor Conde said outside of L & B Spumoni Gardens in the Gravesend neighborhood of Brooklyn on Tuesday. “It melts in your mouth. It’s always fresh. I’ve never had a bad slice here.”

Mr. Conde, who grew up nearby, summed up a general sentiment about the Connecticut designation felt by many New Yorkers: “Yeah no,” he said. “That’s crazy.”

Maggie DeMarco Mieles, whose father, Domenico DeMarco, opened Di Fara Pizza in Brooklyn’s Midwood in 1965, said there were three things that always created controversy: religion, politics and pizza. Mr. DeMarco, who died in 2022, has godfather status among New York slice devotees, linking the cooking of Southern Italy and the gas-oven pie beloved by New Yorkers and tourists alike.

“I think my Dad would say, to each his own,” said Ms. Mieles, who now runs the pizzeria with her family.","A group of people are gathered around a large pizza, cutting it into slices with a knife and fork.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x117 at 0x7D6BA13E72B0>,2024-05-22 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/nyregion/new-haven-pizza-capital.html,['Politics' 'Local/Regional'],[0.9 0.7],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/48dfbf71e3.png
4ba82d5cf0,The New York Times,How Has Trump Changed the G.O.P.? His Criminal-Trial Guest List Tells the Tale. - The New York Times,"The Republican Party has changed a lot since Donald J. Trump last spent this much time at Trump Tower.

Stuck in New York City four days a week during his criminal trial, Mr. Trump is now back in the same penthouse suite where he weathered so many scandals during his 2016 presidential run.

Back then, Mr. Trump was the Republican nominee, but still very much a party outsider. After the “Access Hollywood” video broke in October 2016 and he was heard bragging about grabbing women’s genitals, he spent the weekend in Trump Tower watching defections. Second-guessing of his candidacy came from across the G.O.P. spectrum, including a canceled event and a public rebuke from the man he had chosen to be his vice president.

What a difference seven and a half years makes.

On Monday, a contender to be Mr. Trump’s next vice president, Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, traveled to New York to make a show of solidarity with his party’s presumptive nominee. Mr. Vance began his day at Trump Tower and then went inside the courthouse on the same day that some of the “Access Hollywood” episode was recounted and a secret recording played in which Mr. Trump discussed payoffs to bury harmful stories.

Mr. Vance was joined by Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, along with Alabama’s attorney general, Iowa’s attorney general and a Republican congresswoman from Staten Island.

On Tuesday, as the prosecution’s key witness, Michael D. Cohen, was expected to be cross-examined, the speaker of the House was riding to the courthouse in Mr. Trump’s motorcade, along with two other politicians whose names have been in the vice-presidential sweepstakes, Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota and Representative Byron Donalds of Florida, plus Vivek Ramaswamy, who unsuccessfully ran in the 2024 primary as a pro-Trump alternative.

“We have a lot of great people here to talk to you,” Mr. Trump said on Tuesday, before entering a courtroom he said he had nicknamed “the icebox.”

The warm embrace was a sign of just how far Mr. Trump’s legal troubles are from making him a party pariah. Instead, the trial over hush-money payments to the porn star Stormy Daniels is a staging ground for aspiring politicians to prove their fealty, the latest litmus test in a party increasingly defined by loyalty to Mr. Trump.

“What’s going on inside that courtroom is a threat to American democracy,” Mr. Vance declared on Monday in a news conference outside the courthouse in Lower Manhattan, attacking some people, including the judge’s daughter, that Mr. Trump has been expressly barred from talking about via gag order.

It was a theme that has emerged from Mr. Trump’s numerous guests: They have been making the trek to New York and amplifying the former president’s talking points, ripping into those Mr. Trump is forbidden from speaking about.

Other political allies who have come to court include David McIntosh, the head of the Club for Growth, who directed millions of dollars in spending opposing Mr. Trump in 2023 but has since made efforts to get back into his good graces. And there was Senator Rick Scott of Florida and Ken Paxton, the attorney general of Texas.

Mr. Trump has at times said he wanted to see a show of support in the streets outside his trial, and a series of aides, plus his son, Eric, have attended the trial itself. A Trump official said that the campaign had not invited the parade of politicians but that allies were volunteering on their own.

“They chose to show up,” Mr. Trump said as he left the courthouse on Monday. “They view this as a scam.”

Eight years ago, there was a robust “Never Trump” push inside the party to deny Mr. Trump the nomination. This year, there has been little to no serious discussion inside the G.O.P. of replacing Mr. Trump atop the ticket, even in the case of a criminal conviction before the party’s summer convention.

Mr. Trump has not changed since 2016. The party has.

In 2016, Paul D. Ryan was the speaker of the House. He was a pained, publicly reluctant supporter of Mr. Trump. Just last week, Mr. Ryan said he would not vote for Mr. Trump this year. “Character is too important to me,” he said.

In 2024, Mike Johnson is the speaker of the House. He is a pleased, publicly solicitous endorser of Mr. Trump. Just last week, Mr. Johnson held a news conference on Capitol Hill to amplify one of Mr. Trump’s political obsessions: preventing undocumented immigrants from voting. One of Mr. Trump’s lightning-rod former advisers, Stephen Miller, was by his side.

Today, to the extent that Mr. Trump has Republican critics, they are increasingly former Republicans, offering their commentary as often on CNN as in the corridors of Congress.

Mr. Trump has certainly worked to purify the party. He has celebrated the defeat of anyone he views as a disloyal Republican, even those who lost their seats to Democrats.

“I’m not sure that I should be happy or sad, but I feel just fine about it,” Mr. Trump said the day after the 2018 midterms, ticking off the names of several Republicans who had just lost as Democrats took control of the chamber.

“Mia Love gave me no love,” Mr. Trump said of former Representative Mia Love of Utah, who had just been defeated by a Democrat. “And she lost. Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia.”

In the 2022 midterm elections, he set out to oust all 10 House Republicans who had voted to impeach him for his conduct ahead of and during the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. By the end of the election, only two of the 10 remained — and both, not incidentally, had survived in states where the top two finishers advanced to the general election, not in a closed Republican primary.

After seeing the courtroom on Monday, Mr. Vance, who won his 2022 Senate primary after Mr. Trump endorsed him, said in a post on X that “I’m now convinced the main goal of this trial is psychological torture” for Mr. Trump.

The former president, who can be seen carrying news clippings of comments made about the trial as he leaves, appeared to appreciate the words of support from those who stood with him. But he had another idea of how they could help him.

“We have a lot of them that want to come,” Mr. Trump said on Monday. “I say just stay back and pass lots of laws to stop things like this.”

88cbb494c3,Newsweek,Full List of Celebrities Endorsing RFK Jr. - Newsweek,"As we edge closer to November's general election, many celebrities are expressing support for either Donald Trump or Joe Biden, but a growing number back independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

Kennedy, son of former Senator Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of former President John F. Kennedy—both assassinated in the 1960s—rose to prominence in recent years with his vocal stance against vaccines.

The 70-year-old attorney sought to challenge Joe Biden for the 2024 Democratic presidential nomination but withdrew from the race and declared himself an independent candidate in October 2023.

Many view Kennedy as a controversial choice due to his strong anti-vaccine stance and reported support of conspiracy theories, such as the unsubstantiated beliefs that COVID-19 targets certain races, the 2004 presidential election was stolen by voter fraud, and a link between mass shootings and prescription drugs.

As more celebrities speak out in support of Kennedy, Newsweek has compiled a list of them.

Newsweek emailed Kennedy's press team for comment on Thursday.

Jenny McCarthy and Donnie Wahlberg

On Saturday, former New Kids on the Block star Donnie Wahlberg and his wife, actor Jenny McCarthy, publicly endorsed Kennedy on social media.

In a video uploaded to Instagram, McCarthy said: ""I'm endorsing Bobby for president.""

""Our dear friend Bobby,"" Wahlberg chimed in, before the duo shouted: ""Go Bobby.""

Rob Schneider

In 2023, the actor and comedian endorsed Kennedy in the 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries. Then, in April this year, Schneider appeared on Fox & Friends First to explain why he supported the independent presidential candidate.

Schneider said health care is one of his top priorities: ""We spent five times more than they do in Europe for health care. And we have way worse results. We can't have 60 percent of the American population, unhealthy, 54 percent of children. That needs to be the biggest story for you guys in all mass media. The fact that children have chronic illness at over 50 percent, that's a 10-12-year-old statistic. So we have to get people healthy.""

He added: ""[Kenny is] talking about things that really matter.""

Schneider also stated that people are tired of being offered the same thing, alluding to the potential rematch between President Biden and former President Trump.

Alicia Silverstone

In a post to Instagram on June 6, 2023, Alicia Silverstone revealed that in 2022, she canceled her Democratic Party registration and registered as an independent voter.

She explained that she did this because she was ""deeply disappointed with political leadership at every turn."" The Clueless star pointed to ""division,"" ""lies"" and ""the profiteering at the expense of the people and public health.""

""But @robertfkennedyjr gives me hope,"" she wrote. ""This man gets me excited about the potential for truth and justice. He provides hope for young and old to trust our government once again. RFK Jr. is a person we can be inspired and be proud to call President.

""Bobby is a true leader. He loves our country deeply and is the most courageous warrior. He fights for all mothers and children. He fights for our planet, fairness, and freedom. He is someone who can unify the divide in this country. He is a walking history book; a passionate loving human with no tolerance for corruption or bullying.

""I love his vision of peace, unity, and justice for all. I am uplifted by his commitment to protect civil and worker rights as well as our children's health. We need leaders who will resolve poverty, pollution, inequality, and stop wars... Bobby is that leader.""

Silverstone finished the post by recommending that those feeling disenfranchised by the government listen to Kennedy speak. She also stated that she has worked alongside Kennedy for children's health and our environment for ""15-plus years.""

She added: ""I love me some Bobby!! He is just incredible. If you want more information, go to Kennedy24.com to learn more about this incredible leader.""

Kevin Spacey

On May 6, Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey took to social media to call Kennedy a ""formidable fighter for justice"" and a ""loyal friend"" when he reposted a promotional video for Kennedy's presidential campaign narrated by actor Woody Harrelson.

""There's a lot I can learn from this man. When the world turned its back on me, Bobby leaned in [prayer emoji],"" Spacey wrote on X (formerly Twitter), referring to the charges of sexual misconduct leveled against him which he was cleared of in court.

""He's a formidable fighter for justice and a loyal friend that's not afraid to stand up for what he believes.""

While Harrelson narrated the video, he denied that he was endorsing Kennedy.

""Bobby is a personal friend,"" he told USA TODAY through his representative. ""I don't endorse candidates from either party because I'm an anarchist.""

Cheryl Hines

Cheryl Hines, who starred in Curb Your Enthusiasm, has been married to the independent candidate since 2014. She publicly supports her husband by attending a variety of his fundraisers and rallies.

While Hines supports Kennedy's political goals, she doesn't agree with all of his opinions. On January 23 Kennedy spoke at an anti-vaccine rally, where he compared the pressure to get vaccinated to the Nazi regime.

""Even in Hitler's Germany, you could cross the Alps into Switzerland, you could hide in an attic like Anne Frank did. Today, the mechanisms are being put in place that will make it so none of us can run, and none of us can hide,"" he said.

When a video of the speech went viral online, Hines wrote on X: ""My husband's opinions are not a reflection of my own. While we love each other, we differ on many current issues.""

Jessica Sutta

In recent months Jessica Sutta, a former member of The Pussycat Dolls, has been supporting Kennedy and Nicole Shanahan, his running mate, in a variety of posts on social media. She has also spoken at their voter rallies.

In an Instagram post from March, Sutta explained that she didn't become a political person until ""my health was ripped from me."" She claimed that she had been diagnosed with vaccine-induced lupus, which has taught her to ""stand for what's right for humanity.""

Her caption continued: ""Sorry to disappoint but I will not back down. I Def [sic] did not feel good yesterday as my body was in a lupus flare but it was beautiful for my soul to be apart [sic] of history. Proud to know @theangiestanton who did incredible yesterday!! Nicole Shanahan is gonna make a perfect VP. Her goal is to end the epidemic for chronic illness amongst our youth. Let's GO!""

Pierce Brosnan

While Pierce Brosnan hasn't publicly said anything himself, a photo of him alongside Kennedy was uploaded to X on September 22, 2023.

Kennedy uploaded a photo of him and the movie star with the caption: ""Two Irishmen at the Kennedy for President fundraiser on Point Dume last night.""

Eric Clapton

In September 2023, Eric Clapton raised $2.2 million for Kennedy at a private fundraiser. According to a statement from Kennedy's campaign, the event raised $1 million for the campaign and $1.2 million for a super political action committee supporting him.

Tickets for the event, where the Grammy-winning musician performed live, cost from $3,300 to $6,600.

""Please join Eric Clapton and me in LA for a special campaign fundraiser + private musical performance!"" Kennedy posted to X in August 2023.

Aaron Rodgers

Rumors previously circulated that NFL veteran Aaron Rodgers might have been chosen as a running mate for the independent presidential candidate. While Kennedy eventually chose Shanahan, Rodgers explained how he felt about the possibility of him taking on the role during an interview with Tucker Carlson.

""My thing is [Donald Trump] had four years to do it and didn't drain the swamp,"" Rodgers said. ""And whether he just got scared because of what he learned when he was in there — I think it's very plausible.

""But that's why I was interested when Bobby came to me and said: 'Would you think about being my running mate?' And I said, 'Are you serious? I'm a f****** football player.' But I love this country, and I'd love to be a part of bringing it back to what she used to be.""

Rodgers, who led the Green Bay Packers to Super Bowl victory in 2011, told Carlson he considered taking on the position, saying: ""Oh yeah, I thought about it. I definitely thought about it because I love Bobby, and I just wanted to hear what he had to say about it.""

Rodgers has continued to publicly support Kennedy.

Jeremy Piven

Jeremy Piven, best-known for Entourage, was a surprise guest at ""A Night of Laughter With RFK Jr. & Friends,"" Kennedy's comedy fundraiser in downtown Los Angeles in February. Piven compared white men to Bitcoin during his time on stage.

""We were the toast of the town, and now everyone's trying to dump us,"" he said, per The Washington Post.","An older man in a suit stands in front of an American flag, with a microphone attached to his lapel.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BCACF4040>,2024-05-30 11:08:24+00:00,https://www.newsweek.com,https://www.newsweek.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-celebrities-endorsing-2024-election-1905795,['Politics' 'Entertainment' 'National'],[0.95 0.85 0.75],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/88cbb494c3.png

Young Mungo by Douglas Stuart

“I couldn’t help but identify with the experience of the character on some level – with the sense of not quite belonging and wanting to escape. It’s a love story set amid destitution. It’s a beautiful book.”

Walé Adeyemi, founder of streetwear label B-side

“I Want You Forever” by Jeymes Samuel feat. D’Angelo and Jay-Z

“The soundtrack to The Book of Clarence, a film directed by a friend of mine, Jeymes Samuel. There’s a track on there with D’Angelo and Jay-Z called “I Want You Forever” and it’s an incredible piece of music – all the instruments and the way it’s put together, it’s quite moving.”

Pieter Hugo, photographer

“Cold Blooded” by Zhu

“I’ve recently rediscovered gothy pop such as The Cure and The Yard. My daughter and I have discovered that our music tastes overlap. I spend a lot of time driving around with her and she often plays bands – Metronomy and Tame Impala – that remind me of music I used to listen to. Through her eyes I’ve rediscovered a genre that I haven’t listened to in ages. We have a combined playlist. The last song I downloaded was ‘Cold Blooded’ by American singer Zhu, which Spotify recommended to me.”

Sister Carrie by Theodore Dreiser

“It’s about a young woman who goes to Chicago, has a bunch of sex with random people and becomes quite prominent in society. It’s a great 1900s tale.”

UK Grim by Sleaford Mods

“My favourite track is ‘So Trendy’. I find the lyrics very poignant.”

St Vincent, musician

Love + Radio

“I think Love + Radio is brilliant. It’s deeply odd, with subversive stories, and the sound design is epic. One that’s more lighthearted is Dear Joan and Jericha, where the hosts Julia Davis and Vicki Pepperdine play two agony aunts giving terrible and hilarious advice.”

Courtney Love, musician

60 songs That Explain the ’90s

“60 Songs That Explain the ’90s, hosted by Rob Harvilla. He is God’s gift to bros and women. I went from “Bitter Sweet Symphony” to “Nookie” to “Zombie” and “Common People”. He’s hilarious. It’s never about what you think it’s about.”

June Ambrose, stylist and creative director

The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F•ck by Mark Manson

“The title is obnoxious, but when you dive into the book it’s more about unpacking trauma and not taking yourself too seriously. I think it’s a healthy read – I gave it to my kids, who are 19 and 22.”

Pierre Mahéo, founder of Officine Générale

Alpha Zulu by Phoenix

“The last music I downloaded was by Phoenix, the album Alpha Zulu, which was recorded in the Musée des Arts Décoratifs. I have been listening to it slowly – what I don’t like about the way we consume music at the moment is how we get through it too quickly, listening in the car and skipping through the songs. I think I’m going to go back to vinyl at home, where you can’t swipe.”

Liz Lambert, hotelier and designer

99% Invisible

“99% Invisible, which is about the architecture and design that surrounds us. I always learn something from Death, Sex & Money, an NPR production on subjects ranging from facing your fears to infidelity to celebrity interviews. Articles of Interest and Hidden Brain are two others that I find fascinating because they dip into so many random topics. I spend so much time travelling that I’m always listening to a podcast.”

Frida Escobedo, architect

Red Scare

“Red Scare, a cultural commentary; and A History of the World in 100 Objects by the BBC. I think it’s fascinating to understand the history of human culture through material artefacts. They hold so many stories. The episodes on the Mexican Codex Map and the Shadow Puppet of Bima are two of my favourites.”

Greg Chait, founder the Elder Statesman

“Paid In Full” by Eric B & Rakim

“I like older hip-hop because anything early has something pure about it; people were making stuff up and we didn’t have social media, so the sound was particular to that area. It brings me back to a place and time.”

Jessica Bell Brown, curator for contemporary art at the Baltimore Museum of Art

Trust by Hernan Diaz

“The best book I’ve read in the past year is Hernan Diaz’s Trust, which won a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. It’s an unintentional history of capital, philanthropy and robber barons; it shows you the underworld of America’s elite.”

Min Jin Lee, author

Pivot

“For tech and business, there’s Pivot with Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway. For law and government, Stay Tuned with Preet with former US attorney Preet Bharara. For creativity, I turn to Design Matters with Debbie Millman. For screenwriting, Scriptnotes with John August and Craig Mazin is very good. For television, TV’s Top 5 with Lesley Goldberg and Daniel Fienberg. For news and politics, The Ezra Klein Show is excellent.”

John Derian, artist

Savage Lovecast

“Dan Savage’s Savage Lovecast, which is all about sex and politics; Right, Left & Center, which covers more politics and pop culture; and SmartLess with Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes and Will Arnett, which is pure comedy, with a surprise guest every episode. This is our trio for long car rides to the Cape.”

Michele Lupi, Men’s Collections Visionary at Tod’s

The Guardian’s G2 Playlist

“The Guardian’s G2 Playlist, from the Film & Music supplement. I was born in 1965, and grew up with punk rock and new wave. I still mostly listen to that kind of stuff, but I find this interesting – they recommend seven new tracks every week, and I keep the best ones on my iPhone playlist. Right now I’m listening to Paramore, a band from that list.”

Fee Greening, illustrator

In Defence of Witches by Mona Chollet

“I read a lot of stuff on witches. In Defence of Witches by Mona Chollet was really great. And I loved Satanic Feminism by Per Faxneld. But for something lighter, I like rock biopics, mainly from the ’70s. I just read Glyn Johns’ Sound Man; he was an engineer on The Rolling Stones’s Exile on Main St and The Beatles’ Let It Be – all those heavy sounds of the ’70s.”

5e779b6d95,ABC News,Family speaks out after giraffe picks up toddler in heart-stopping video - ABC News,"A couple from Texas experienced a shocking incident during their visit to a wildlife center when a giraffe picked up their toddler during a safari drive-thru.

Over the weekend, the family visited Fossil Rim Wildlife Center, where the visitors are allowed to drive themselves through a path to get a closer look at and to feed the wildlife.

Paisley Toten, 2, was sitting at the back of her family's truck with her mom, feeding the giraffe, when the animal grabbed her by the shirt and lifted her into the air.

The moment was caught on camera by Paisley's mom, Sierra Robert, and the visitors in the car behind them.

""By the time I, like, looked back over, she was gone,"" Robert recalled to ""Good Morning America."" ""It was just really shock, you know, adrenaline sets in.""

""My heart just stopped,"" Jason Toten, Paisley's dad, added.

Paisley's dad, Jason Toten, told ABC News his daughter was eventually released by the giraffe and did not suffer any injuries. When Paisley fell, Robert was able to catch her daughter in her arms.

""Her falling to me, me having to catch her like, it’s all in slow motion,"" Robert recounted.

According to the rules on the center's website, during the drive-thru, ""Only giraffes can be fed by hand. This is for your safety, as animals besides giraffe[s] can bite.""

Corbin Maxey, a wildlife expert, told ""GMA"" the giraffe who picked up Paisley likely is comfortable with human interaction.

""This is a giraffe that's used to eating from visitors. And what happened is a toddler was holding that bag of food really, really close and the giraffe leaned in, something it normally does. And by getting the bag of food, it accidentally grabbed the toddler's shirt,"" Maxey said.

Fossil Rim Wildlife Center issued a statement to ABC News on Wednesday.

""We were recently made aware of an incident involving one of our giraffes that occurred this past weekend,"" the statement read. ""The incident was first reported to us on Monday June 3rd. The safety of our guests and animals is always of utmost importance to us. Although an incident like this has never occurred here previously, we are taking immediate action to make sure it won't happen again.""

The statement continued, ""Effective immediately Fossil Rim will no longer be allowing guests to ride through the park in truck beds. Fossil Rim offers a variety of experiences guided by knowledgeable staff so guests can continue to have up-close and memorable animal encounters, and support our mission to save threatened and endangered species.""

The Toten family said they have no ill will toward the wildlife center and plan to return to the park in the future.

""The giraffe was just trying to get some food and it got a little bit more than it bargained for,"" Jason Toten said.

Two-year-old Paisley is also taking the incident in stride and said she still likes giraffes.

Experts say the Fossil Rim Wildlife Center is highly accredited with the Association of Zoos & Aquariums and upholds the highest standards but remind the public to do their research before visiting any zoo, especially if the zoo allows interaction with animals.","A giraffe is seen leaning over the back of a pickup truck, seemingly interacting with a person inside the vehicle.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA4103070>,2024-06-06 11:38:00+00:00,https://abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Living/giraffe-lifts-toddler-air-safari-drive/story?id=110873738,['Local/Regional' 'Other'],[0.9 0.1],Unlikely,Likely,sample_review/images/5e779b6d95.png

Taylor Wilson:

Good morning. I'm Taylor Wilson, and today is Saturday, May 25th, 2024. This is The Excerpt. Today, it's been four years since the murder of George Floyd, plus the UN's top court orders Israel to halt its Rafah offensive in Gaza, and college athletes are about to get paid.

♦

Today, marks four years since George Floyd was killed by police. For a moment, his murder changed everything, but are those days gone? I spoke with USA TODAY Chief Political Correspondent Phillip M. Bailey for a look at what's happened in the years since. Phillip, thanks for hopping on.

Phillip M. Bailey:

What's going on, man?

Taylor Wilson:

What were some of the pledges and commitments we heard back in 2020 in the immediate aftermath of George Floyd's murder?

Phillip M. Bailey:

You saw Fortune 500 corporations making these gigantic financial pledges, saying how important diversity was in their hiring practices. You saw grants being given to do murals for tiny arts groups. Of course, millions took to the streets to protest Floyd's killing. So at the time, it seemed like almost similar to the murder of Emmett Till, the 14-year-old Black boy who was killed back in 1954 in Mississippi, and so the spark in many ways of the civil rights movement.

Many people thought, Taylor, that Floyd's killing would be a similar call to action. And in the initial months and years, it was. But four years later, a lot of those promises have been unkept, a lot of those commitments have been pulled back, and many people, activists, residents, and voters feel like we're in the midst of a backlash, not seen since the civil rights movement.

Taylor Wilson:

Why have so many of these promises remained unfulfilled? And what are some of the counter actions that have also taken place in recent years?

Phillip M. Bailey:

We saw last year the Supreme Court knock down affirmative action, a case involving two prestigious institutions of higher learning here in the United States, North Carolina and Harvard. We've seen a number of these diversity, equity, and inclusion programs come under scrutiny and be banned outright. Different state legislatures have tried to ban DEI from their colleges and universities. We all remember the growing antagonism and anxiety about critical race theory.

I talked to Stephen Graves, a professor of Africana studies out of Oklahoma State University, and his point was the recipe for these backlash movements, they've perfected it. There is enough zero-sum game sentiment around race relations in the country where anytime progress looks like it's about to be achieved or made, there's almost an immediate backlash that often starts with recasting the origins of what this initiative was, why we were here in the first place, and then it gets turned into an anti-white resentment. So I think you've seen that happen over the past four years, but there still is some hope with some of those George Floyd protesters who remain in those movements.

Taylor Wilson:

Has there been any progress around some of those demands following Floyd's murder? I'm thinking about efforts to change law enforcement, but also some of these other issues.

Phillip M. Bailey:

The failure of the movement was that the George Floyd Police Reform Act of 2021 did not pass. But largely we have seen though between 2000 and 2022, for example, 62% of the largest US cities adopted some type of alternative public safety response. That's according to the Brennan Center for Justice. You've seen in different, at least 25 states, rule changes that were directly related to the circumstances of Floyd's murder, such as curtailing use of force, like banning choke-holds, requiring officers to intervene in instances of police misconduct, and forcing local agencies to report officer misconduct data to the states.

Dr. Ben Crump, famous civil rights attorney who's representing a lot of these families, including the Floyd family and others, and he points out, ""Look, we've passed over 100 bills in George Floyd's name at the local and state level."" For example, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, millions of dollars we diverted to establish a new community safety department. Other cities are trying to adopt 911 alternatives where we're sending unarmed civilians to more low emergency calls.

This year we saw a bipartisan bill in the name of Breonna Taylor, a Black woman who was killed months before Floyd was, in her apartment by police officers, who essentially banned the use of no-knock warrants, which were used in her tragic case. But there obviously have been a lot of movement and change at the local grassroots level. And I think a lot of those activists in that space are very encouraged by that and say that the fight is not over by a long shot.

Taylor Wilson:

And Phillip, we're talking during an election year, of course, as it was back in 2020 when Floyd was murdered as well. How are some of the themes and issues that came to the forefront in the aftermath of Floyd's murder playing out this election cycle?

Phillip M. Bailey:

Accountability for law enforcement doesn't really register as a top issue for Americans. Gallup surveys have shown that what's on Americans' minds obviously is the economy, inflation. Even though violent crime has been going down in recent years, the perception of it is still very high and it's certainly something that's an anxiety for a number of Americans.

I think you will see Democrats shy away from this issue. Remember in 2020, Joe Biden featured George Floyd's sister in a campaign ad. Yet by 2022, his state of union address, he went out of his way, Taylor, to criticize defund the police, specifically saying that this is not the time to do that, we don't need to abandon our streets, that he opposes that idea. That became really a wedge issue for Democrats.

I think you're going to see candidates, particularly on the Democratic side, get pressure to talk about police accountability more. It's certainly something that I think for the Biden campaign, they're hearing it, getting an earful from African American voters who say they're not as enthusiastic about voting for Joe Biden again. So I don't think you'll see Democrats really lean into police accountability much this year, but I think you will see Republicans bring it up. So Republicans certainly see it as a wedge issue culturally.

Taylor Wilson:

All right, Phillip M. Bailey, USA TODAY, chief political correspondent joining us here on the anniversary of George Floyd's murder. Thank you, Phillip.

Phillip M. Bailey:

The UN's top court yesterday ordered Israel to immediately halt its military offensive into Rafah, the southern Gaza city, where more than a million Palestinians had been sheltering. The order was adopted by a 13 to 2 vote by the International Court of Justice panel of judges. It requests that Israel submit a report to the court within a month outlining the measures it implemented.

South Africa requested the World Court to make such an order as part of a broader case, accusing Israel of committing genocide in its war against Hamas in Gaza. Israel says South Africa's accusations of genocide are false, outrageous, and morally repugnant. Rulings by the court cannot be enforced and Israel is likely to ignore the order.

The NCAA and Power Five conferences have reached a deal to let schools pay their college athletes. I caught up with USA TODAY, sports columnist, Dan Wolken for a look at how this will work and why it took so long. Dan, thanks for hopping on.

Dan Wolken:

Yeah, no problem.

Taylor Wilson:

So Dan, the NCAA and Power Five conferences have reached a deal to let schools pay players. What is in this deal exactly, and what does it functionally now mean for college sports?

Dan Wolken:

Essentially, college sports has been sued by a whole bunch of people at this point. And pretty consistently, the courts have ruled that the business model of amateurism violates antitrust law. And in this settlement, you're talking about a $2.8 billion damage outlay from the NCAA to the plaintiffs in this case. And the bottom line is that colleges and the NCAA have now recognized that they have to be the ones to share revenue with college athletes.

And so some of that $2.8 billion is going to go to former athletes, people who are no longer playing college sports, while also schools are going to have to set up a revenue sharing agreement that puts in the neighborhood of $20 million per year, that's going to go up a little bit over time, into a pool that they will have to distribute to their athletes. And there's a lot of details that are still yet to be determined about exactly how that's going to be done, but that's the basic nuts and bolts of it.

Taylor Wilson:

And Dan, for folks who don't follow college sports, can you just help us understand how we got to this point and why did it take so long?

Dan Wolken:

Well, for decades and decades, the NCAA has been predicated on this notion that college athletes are students primarily, and as students who just happen to play sports, they are not entitled to any sort of salary or anything beyond their scholarship. They get a small stipend check that they call the cost of attendance.

If you go back about a decade, the forces of capitalism have caught the NCAA in this whirlwind of people looking at the arrangement and saying, ""You guys are making an incredible amount of money off college sports."" Coaches are making $10 million a year now, even these small sports, sports that just don't make any money at all, even their coaches are making several hundred thousand dollars a year.

And the reason that's all happening in addition to these fancy facilities is because they actually don't have to pay the players. It was a business model that was great for the colleges and their revenue grew and the scholarship that the student athletes were getting essentially stayed the same.

And so that prompted a series of legal challenges over the course of a number of years. And now here we are where pretty consistently, all these courts have just said this cannot go on. And the NCAA, as resistant to change as it's been, has essentially been forced to allow name, image, and likeness. The athletes can go get marketing deals and sponsorships and advertisements, and now they're going to be paid directly by the school. So it's a pretty big change that's happened because of all these legal challenges that have come right to the NCAA's doorstep.

Taylor Wilson:

And Dan, you wrote about private equity getting involved here as the business model shifts. What do we know here and what are some of the potential concerns?

Dan Wolken:

A lot of these schools now looking at the amount of money they're going to have to pay to college athletes as part of a revenue sharing deal, they're a little bit concerned about where that money's going to come from. They've been operating on these budgets for a number of years where they essentially spend everything they make, and now they've got this huge new expense.

And so private equity affiliated people have been pitching, ""Hey, we'll give you 50 million, $100 million to do whatever you want with. And what we're going to do is on the back end, take a significant percentage of future revenue and we're going to offer, if you want it, our expertise on how to make more money."" There's certainly an appeal to that because a lot of these schools are feeling a cash crunch.

But at the same time, what you're doing is by letting in an outside entity, especially one with a track record of going in and in some cases gutting businesses, significantly reducing expenses, making different deals with their debt responsibilities, that these schools, 10 years, 15 years down the road, could be ceding a significant portion of control that they have, not just over their own revenue, but over their own business strategy.

And so I don't know that this is necessarily going to be a huge thing that a bunch of schools are going to be raising their hand and trying to take this money because I do think a lot of them understand the implications of it. But there are definitely some schools that are desperate enough to give it a thought.

Taylor Wilson:

All right. Dan Wolken is a national columnist for USA TODAY Sports. Thank you, Dan.

Dan Wolken:

Morgan Spurlock, the director and documentarian behind the film, Supersize Me, has died. He rose to fame as the subject of the diet documentary that followed his physical and emotional reactions to eating from fast food chain, McDonald's, every single day for a month. Supersize Me became a sensation among viewers for its social commentary about health, wellness, and obesity as Spurlock strictly consumed to chain, including its supersize option to prove the harms of fast food in America and around the world.

He also starred in other projects from his 2008 documentary, Where in the World is Osama bin Laden, to the 3-season reality show 30 Days. He later outed himself during the Me Too movement saying he was accused of rape in college and called himself part of the problem. Morgan Spurlock was 53.

0365e065a7,The Globe and Mail,U.S. economy regains momentum in second quarter as inflation slows - The Globe and Mail,"The U.S. economy grew faster than expected in the second quarter amid solid gains in consumer spending and business investment, but inflation pressures subsided, leaving intact expectations of a September interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve.

Growth last quarter also received a boost from inventory building as well as increased government spending, the Commerce Department’s advance report on second-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday showed. The housing-market recovery, however, regressed and was a small drag on the economy. The trade deficit widened further, subtracting from GDP growth.

The report dispelled concerns that the economic expansion was in danger of an abrupt end, which had been stoked by a lacklustre performance in the first quarter and in April.

The economy continues to outperform its global peers, despite hefty rate hikes from the U.S. central bank in 2022 and 2023, thanks to a resilient labour market.

“Economic growth is solid, not too hot and not too cold,” said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS. “Inflation looks to be going the Fed’s way and an easing of monetary restraint with an interest-rate cut is likely in September.”

Gross domestic product increased at a 2.8-per-cent annualized rate last quarter, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its advance estimate of second-quarter GDP. That was double the 1.4-per-cent growth pace in the first quarter.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP rising at a 2.0-per-cent rate. Estimates ranged from a 1.1-per-cent rate to a 3.4-per-cent pace.

The growth rate in the first half of the year averaged 2.1 per cent, half the 4.2-per-cent pace logged in the last six months of 2023. That is just above the 1.8-per-cent pace viewed by U.S. central bank officials as the non-inflationary growth rate.

Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy, increased at around a 2.3-per-cent rate after slowing to a 1.5-per-cent pace in the January-March quarter. Spending was driven by increased outlays on services like health care, housing and utilities as well as club memberships, visits to sports centres, parks, theatres and museums, and gambling.

Consumers also boosted outlays on goods, including new light trucks, recreational goods and vehicles, furnishings and durable household equipment as well as energy products.

Spending was in part supported by wage gains. A separate report from the Labour Department on Thursday showed the labour market steadily easing, with initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropping 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 235,000 for the week ended July 20.

Business investment picked up as spending on equipment, mostly aircraft, surged at an 11.6-per-cent rate after rising at only a 1.6-per-cent pace in the first quarter. Spending on intellectual property products continued to rise, though the pace slowed from the brisk rate in the January-March quarter.

Businesses also accumulated more inventory, which increased at a US$71.3-billion rate after rising at a US$28.6-billion pace in the prior quarter.

Inventories added 0.82 percentage points to GDP growth after being a drag for two straight quarters. That more than offset a 0.72-percentage-point hit from a wider trade gap.

Even discounting inventories, trade and government spending, growth was solid last quarter, with domestic demand rising at a 2.6-per-cent pace. The increase in final sales to private domestic purchasers matched the gain in the January-March quarter.

“The U.S. economy is much stronger than people realize and to the extent that markets were worried about a growth slowdown, they should breathe a sigh of relief,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance.

Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.

The rise in GDP growth bodes well for a pick up in productivity, which would slow the pace of increase in labour costs and ultimately price pressures. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, increased at a 2.9-per-cent rate after surging at a 3.7-per-cent pace in the first quarter.

While the rise in the so-called core PCE price index was slightly above economists’ expectations for a 2.7-per-cent rate of increase, the trend is slowing. Core inflation increased 2.7 per cent from a year ago, welcome news for policy makers ahead of their two-day policy meeting next week.

The core PCE price index is one of the inflation measures tracked by the Fed for its 2 per cent target.

“We think revisions to past data may explain part of the miss,” said Daniel Vernazza, chief international economist at UniCredit Bank.

The government’s broadest gauge of prices in the economy, the gross domestic purchases price index, rose at a 2.3-per-cent pace after jumping at a 3.1-per-cent rate in the January-March quarter.

The Fed has maintained its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25 per cent-5.50 per cent range for the past year. It has hiked its policy rate by 525 basis points since 2022. Financial markets expect three rate cuts this year, starting in September.

Despite the solid economic growth pace, the outlook for the second half of the year is hazy. The labour market is slowing, which will impact wage gains.

Though wages rose, income at the disposal of households after adjusting for inflation and taxes increased more slowly last quarter, rising at a 1.0-per-cent rate after climbing at a 1.3-per-cent pace in the first quarter.

That meant consumers turned to savings and also saved less to fund their spending last quarter. The saving rate fell to 3.5 per cent from 3.8 per cent in the January-March period and is now well below its prepandemic average.

Economists also estimate that much of the Fed’s rate hikes is still to be felt. State and local government revenues are also slowing, which could erode spending. There are also worries about new tariffs, which could see businesses front-loading imports if former president Donald Trump is returned to the White House in November’s presidential election.

Nonetheless, a recession is not expected, with monetary policy easing anticipated this year.

“Economic activity is indeed about to downshift into a below potential path in the second half of the year,” said Scott Anderson, chief U.S. economist at BMO Capital Markets.","An industrial warehouse with workers handling packages and boxes, labeled with 'C' and 'B' codes, and a fire extinguisher in the background.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BCA81EB90>,2024-07-25 11:27:10.280000+00:00,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-us-growth-likely-picked-up-last-quarter-after-a-sluggish-start-to-2024/,['Business and Finance' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/0365e065a7.png

Good morning,

Walking into an Abercrombie & Fitch store today, you won’t find shirtless models or a strong cologne scent. The iconic brand that dominated young adult fashion in the Y2K era has undergone a transformation, and it’s leading to outsized market returns.

The retailer, once criticized for controversial and exclusive marketing tactics, has reinvented itself by focusing on inclusivity, and offering a broader product range targeting young professionals. Last week, Abercrombie & Fitch reported the highest first-quarter net sales in company history, leading shares to surge more than 20% after the earnings announcement.

Its stock has grown over fivefold, outpacing AI darling Nvidia, over the past year.

FIRST UP

The S&P 500 just had its best May since 2009, but the rally was concentrated in just a handful of stocks: Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta tacked on a whopping $1.3 trillion in market cap last month, accounting for 76% of the index’s total gains.

BUSINESS + FINANCE

Inflation held steady in April at a historically high level, according to new data released Friday, as Americans continue to grapple with sticky price increases, though the fact inflation isn’t getting worse was viewed as a boon by investors. Headline inflation was 2.7% in April, according to the Commerce Department’s personal consumption expenditures index released Friday morning, while Core PCE inflation, which excludes the more volatile food and energy subindexes, was 2.8% in April. Core PCE inflation remains well above the Fed’s long-held 2% target.

The pandemic opened doors for Tempus Realty Partners, which has done more than $800 million in sale-leasebacks over the last three and a half years, according to partner Dan Andrews. In a sale-leaseback, a company sells a property while immediately leasing it back, continuing to operate as usual. Since inception, Tempus has acquired 106 properties worth $1 billion, with total assets currently valued at around $800 million, per Andrews.

WEALTH + ENTREPRENEURSHIP

Shares of biotech firmSummit Therapeutics more than tripled on Thursday following good news about a drug candidate to treat a type of lung cancer. The 272% surge in Summit’s stock more than doubled the fortune of pharma billionaire Bob Duggan to $7.5 billion in a day, Forbes estimates.

Tesla isrecalling more than 125,000 cars in the U.S. because of a software issue that prevents the seat belt warning system from activating, increasing the risk of injury in a crash, federal regulators said Friday. The automaker has issued 2.5 million recalls so far this year, second only to Ford in terms of total vehicles recalled.

Tesla chief Elon Musk is facing fresh insider trading accusations surrounding the sale of more than $7.5 billion worth of Tesla stock in late 2022, according to a lawsuit filed Thursday. The lawsuit, filed by Tesla investor Michael Perry, alleges Musk had nonpublic information about Tesla falling short on fourth-quarter deliveries and production when he sold the stock in November and December 2022.

MONEY + POLITICS

Former PresidentDonald Trump said Friday he will appeal his felony convictions, a day after a Manhattan jury found him guilty of 34 counts of falsifying records, making him the first current or former president to be convicted of a crime. An appeal sets the stage for the case to drag on months, or potentially years, past the November general election.

Three years ago, Truth Social’s parent company viewed Trump’s criminal conviction as a realistic enough possibility that it announced a contingency plan. The description of the contingency plan was vague: “The company principal’s ownership and position in the company shall be structured in such a way as to eliminate the need for restructuring of ownership or changes in position were a material disruptive event to occur,” an SEC filing said.

WORLD

President Joe Biden announced and strongly endorseda new three-phase cease-fire proposal through negotiators from Qatar on Friday, urging Hamas to accept the proposal as Israel continues its operation in Rafah. Israel’s official position on the deal remains unclear, but a senior White House official told ABC News on Sunday the U.S. had “every expectation” Israel would agree if Hamas accepts.

DAILY COVER STORY

How BuzzBallz Drinks Went From A Fun Side Hustle To $400 Million Fortune

TOPLINE Brightly colored, plastic spheres filled with pre-mixed drinks with names like “Cran Blaster” and “Forbidden Apple” are packed onto thousands of shelves across America, from supermarkets to gas stations. BuzzBallz, as these ready-to-drink cocktails are known, started as a side hustle and has transformed into one of the biggest brands in the $2 billion industry.

“I’ve been living in the American Dream,” says BuzzBallz founder and CEO Merrilee Kick. “We’ve built a legacy. We’ve become a contender in a space where women never went.”

In 14 years since she founded the brand, Kick has built BuzzBallz into an alcohol industry powerhouse. In addition to distribution across the United States, the brand is now sold in 29 countries with annual revenue that Forbes estimates is roughly $500 million.

The 61-year-old Kick, in turn, has become one of the alcohol industry’s biggest success stories, with one of best exits ever for a woman. The former public school teacher from Plano, Texas, never sold a stake in the company, but did give 24.5% to each of her two sons, Alex and Andrew, now president and vice president of BuzzBallz. The Louisiana-based spirits conglomerate Sazerac, owned by billionaire William Goldring, acquired BuzzBallz in May in an all-cash deal that Forbes estimates is at least $500 million. Neither Kick nor Sazerac would comment on the size of the deal, but, without providing documentation, Kick says that the actual figure is much higher. Forbes conservatively estimates that, after taxes, Kick pocketed at least $400 million. That’s enough to earn Kick a No. 84 spot on Forbes’ annual list of America’s Richest Self-Made Women.

The Sazerac sale is a rare feat in an industry with few female founders.

WHY IT MATTERS

Pre-batched cocktails are typically one of the most competitive parts of the spirits industry, with plenty of new entrants and long-standing rivalries among big brands. The category has been growing 30% year-over-year, according to Spins, which tracks retail sales nationwide. According to InsightAce Analytic, the sector is projected to hit $5 billion in sales by 2030.

a232ba7faa,USA TODAY,"Georgia Voter Guide: Key state Senate races in Savannah, Athens and Augusta - USA TODAY","The voter registration deadline is on Oct. 7.

Election day for the general election is Tuesday, Nov. 5.

Early voting runs from Oct. 15 through Nov. 1.

School vouchers. Voting rights. Medicaid expansion. All are top issues before Georgia voters head to the polls on Nov. 5 to cast ballots for president, U.S. House and the state legislature.

In the state Senate, all 56 seats are up for election this year, with contests against several incumbent legislators across the Peach State. Here are the candidates for state Senate in Athens, Augusta and Savannah.

Savannah: Georgia state Senate District 1

Incumbent Sen. Ben Watson, R-Savannah, is a practicing physician and the chairman of the Senate Health and Human Services Committee, Watson, who represents parts of Bryan, Liberty, and Chatham counties, has long held conservative priorities. This past legislative session, as he faced Republican challenger Beth Majeroni, he favored a range of ideologically-driven issues, championing bills that sought to restrict books in school libraries and outlaw gender-affirming care for transgender children. He also played a pivotal role in preventing Medicaid expansion in Georgia, appearing at the meeting of a committee in which he isn’t a member and cast the deciding “no” vote which killed the bill. He is running unopposed.

Savannah: Georgia state Senate District 2

Incumbent Sen. Derek Mallow, D-Savannah, was first elected to the Georgia House in 2020 and the state Senate in 2022. Mallow is a relative newcomer to the Chatham delegation. During his first term as a senator, he championed issues like expanding access to affordable housing and public transit. A Savannah native, 35-year-old Mallow is running for reelection in District 2 and has held office since January 2023. He previously represented House District 163, and is running unopposed.

His current committee assignments include the Judiciary; Public Safety; Reapportionment and Redistricting; State Institutions and Property; and Higher Education committees. Jones previously served as the solicitor general of Augusta. He is running unopposed.

Augusta: Georgia state Senate District 23

Incumbent Sen. Max Burns, R-Sylvania, is running for reelection as a member of the Georgia Senate against Democratic challenger Shayna Boston. He has represented District 23 since his first term began in 2021. In the last few years, Burns authored SB 202 and SB 189, two pieces of legislation that brought sweeping overhauls to state election law. His career outside of politics includes working as the president of Gordon State College, a professor at Georgia Southern University, and a businessman. On his campaign site, he lists agriculture, infrastructure, and expanding access to broadband connectivity to rural communities among his top issues. Burns continues to live on his family farm.

Democrat Shayna Boston is running against incumbent Max Burns to represent Georgia's 23rd District. A native of Swainsboro, Georgia, she received a degree in educational studies from Clark Atlanta University and went on to a seven-year career in entrepreneurship. Her campaign website says she currently works as CEO and owner of BostonFirst Administrative Management. Boston additionally serves as a board member for the Department of Children & Family Services and 1st Vice Chair for the Emanuel County Democratic Committee. Boston lists small business and economic development, gang violence prevention, and community unity as some of her top issues in her campaign.

Athens: Georgia state Senate District 46

Incumbent Sen. Bill Cowsert, R-Athens, is running for reelection to the Georgia state Senate to represent District 46. Cowsert, 65, is a long-time member of the state Senate, having been originally elected to the 46th District in 2007. Prior to entering politics, he founded the Athens law firm Cowsert & Avery. He currently serves as the GOP chairman for the Senate Special Committee on Investigations. The committee is tasked with investigating the professional conduct of Fani Willis, the Fulton County district attorney in charge of prosecuting the Georgia election interference case against former President Donald Trump. Cowsert and the committee began their investigation into Willis following a motion filed by Trump and several of his co-defendants in the case. An investigation conducted by USA TODAY also found that Cowsert was involved in a controversy during the 2018 legislative session, when the Hidden Predator Act of 2018 (HB 605) was referred to his committee. The bill ultimately failed to pass. Cowsert's law partner is currently defending a local Georgia church in a case of child sex abuse concealment. Cowsert maintains that his partner's involvement in the case is not a conflict of interest and that he has no personal involvement in the case.

Democrat Gareth Fenley is running for Georgia state Senate in District 46, as a first-time Democratic candidate against incumbent Bill Cowsert. Born in California, Fenley has lived in the South since 1989. According to her campaign website, she works as a professional social worker, entrepreneur, and community volunteer. Fenley bills herself as a pro-choice and pro-democracy candidate. She says some of Georgia's greatest challenges in the next decade will be resolving crises of housing and economic inequality, fighting climate change, and embracing growing racial and ethnic diversity.

Athens: Georgia state Senate District 47

Incumbent Sen. Frank Ginn, R-Danielsville, represents District 47 in the Georgia state Senate and has held office since 2011. He is currently running for reelection against Democratic challenger Conolus Scott. Ginn received his B.S. in agricultural engineering from the University of Georgia. Before starting his tenure in the state Senate, he served as director of member services for Jackson EMC, as well as city manager for Royston and Sugar Hill, both located near the north Georgia mountains.

783c8eadd9,CNN,How older Democratic voters are responding to Harris replacing Biden - CNN,"Darrell Ann Murphy is relieved, grateful and newly hopeful Democrats can win Pennsylvania and the White House. But she is also still upset, a little mad even.

“Wow, we’re losing Joe Biden,” said Murphy, 83, a retiree who keeps busy teaching the Chinese tile game Mahjong to fellow seniors. “Joe was us. He was every one of us. He cared so much about the middle class and everyone else of course.”

We revisited Murphy this week at her Easton home, and she assembled the same group for a Mahjong game as she did when we first stopped by five months ago. Then, three of the four women at the table said they believed Biden was up to the job and that criticism of his age was unfair. This time, all four said the 81-year-old president was doing the right thing by stepping away from the campaign.

“Surprise and relief” was how Catherine Long characterized her reaction. Long said she believes it was the president’s decision in the end, but added, “I didn’t like how people were telling him to get out of the game.”

Mary Ann Horvath also used the term relief and “much less anxiety.”

We included these voters in our All Over the Map battleground state project because they are all above the age of 70, members of the country’s most reliable voting demographic and residents of one of its bellwether presidential counties. The project’s goal is to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of key voters — and what we heard, then and now, about their takes on the Biden age issue was telling.

The debate was the decisive moment.

“It was sad,” Horvath said.

But all of our Northampton County voters also told us they saw things in the weeks, even months, before the June debate that gave them pause: incomplete thoughts, mixing up names, slower and stiffer movements.

“I know how things can change when you’re older,” Murphy said. “Past 80, things can change on a dime.”

Recognizing there’s a hard road ahead but feeling energized

The mood among Democrats here is suddenly very different. Before Biden’s decision, morale was low and losing seemed inevitable. Now, the energy is palpable, even though Democrats here understand Kamala Harris faces a tough challenge in Pennsylvania.

“I don’t think a lot of men will vote for Harris,” said Pamela Aita, the one conservative voter in the Mahjong group. “I just don’t. … I just don’t think a majority of men are ready for a female president.”

Murphy, though, voiced confidence that Harris in 2024 will fare better than Hillary Clinton 2016. Times have changed, she believes. And so have the issues that are front and center.

“Reproductive rights. Come on, women,” Murphy said. “Here we are after Roe v. Wade. Here we are. … I think her age is, is really so important. You know, she’s, she’s at the perfect age. She’s committed, she’s vigorous. And overwhelmingly the women I talked to are, ‘let’s go, let’s go.’’’

Murphy was not alone in our group to suggest Harris would improve her Pennsylvania odds by choosing Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro as her running mate.

“I think he is incredibly smart,” Murphy said. “Very modest, understated guy. … He is focused like a beam when he wants to do something. I think he would be the perfect balance.”

Local civil rights activist Marvin Boyer is a lifelong Easton resident who knows Northampton County well. The reaction to Harris, he said, convinced him she has a chance.

“It also re-energizes this strong constituency of the Democratic Party – meaning Black females,” Boyer said in an interview at an Easton museum where he was instrumental in assembling the Black history exhibit. “There seems to be a great deal of support, a groundswell of support for her candidacy.”

High Black turnout in Easton and Bethlehem is critical. Those two cities are the deep blue parts of this county. It takes just a short drive north or west to find Donald Trump flags dotting the lawns and homes.

“Just the other day I was riding down one of the main streets and the guy drives by with a truck with an American flag and a F-Biden flag flying,” Boyer said. “The anger is something else that is very troubling, and the divisiveness is problematic.”

Boyer is an independent but votes Democratic most of the time. He was loyal to Biden. He is excited about Harris.

“One of the things I felt was lacking with the candidate, the Democratic candidate is being more assertive,” Boyer said. “When you are running against a candidate like Trump, you can’t be milquetoast, you can’t be middle of the road. You have to be aggressive. Because he’s coming after you. And I think she’s up to the challenge in that regard.”

Boyer knows his innate optimism is about to be tested.

“There’s still racism, misogyny in this country in 2024, no question,” he said. “Will we overcome it with this election enough that she can be elected? I hope so.”

‘The time had come’

We put the same question to Larry Malinconico, a geology professor at Lafayette College: Is America ready to elect a woman of color as its president?

“I hope so,” Malinconico said in an interview in the classroom where we first met him in February. “I’m a little nervous about that. … It’s an extremely big test. It will be incredibly exciting or incredibly disappointing come November.”

The early buzz gives him optimism. Malinconico said his wife contributed to the Democrats as soon as news of Biden’s Harris endorsement broke. Students, too, he believes will rally around Harris. Younger voters were a giant crack in Biden’s coalition.

“We don’t want Donald Trump as president,” Malinconico said. “And there’s an acceptable choice now. When before I think there was real skepticism about the viability of President Biden for another four years.”

On our first visit, Malinconico said he had friends and colleagues who raised questions about Biden’s ability to do the job. Back then, he said he did not share those doubts, but that Biden needed to prove them wrong. But his opinion began to change over the spring, and the debate sealed it.

“I initially thought, let’s be fair here,” Malinconico said. “Someone who is in their early 80s could be perfectly viable as a candidate as president of the United States. But as things were going on, you really have to start to question okay, what’s happening here. And as somebody who has seen, for example, my father go through an eventual decline to the point where I was asked to take over his affairs, I sort of recognize this. The time had come, and you don’t take over the affairs of the president, you have someone else do the job.”

Still, he said he was confident Biden could finish his term now that he didn’t also need to deal with the rigors of a campaign.

Malinconico very much hopes Harris and Trump reach agreement to debate.

“I think that she should be able to push his buttons.”

What voters want to see from Harris

Pat Levin for months bristled at the Biden age conversation.

She is a few weeks away from turning 95, is sharp as a tack, a vigorous and eager participant in pilates classes she jokes help keep her vertical.

Performance, not age, is Levin’s test. And she sadly came to the conclusion that a president she admires can no longer pass it.

“I love him. I think he has been just wonderful,” Levin said. “But he is definitely impaired in terms of his thinking, in terms of his presentation, in terms of his energy. He’s just not up to it.”

Her advice to Harris is telling – so many voters who were loyal to Biden are now blunt about what was missing.

“She needs to get out there,” Levin said. “Get into those into those swing states, show her enthusiasm and her stamina and her strength and be able to communicate strongly. She’s a very intelligent woman. She’s got a lot of confidence. She’s got a lot of stamina.”

Biden was born in Pennsylvania. He won here in 2020 in part because he performed better than Hillary Clinton among white working-class voters. Democrats here understand Harris has work to do there, or in finding a different winning coalition.

“It doesn’t look too good right now,” Levin said of the Pennsylvania odds. “But I think she can turn it around.”

Levin tells anyone who seeks her advice that sure, inflation and immigration matter, but there is something more fundamental at stake.

“It’s democracy,” she said. “This might be our last free and fair election. If we don’t win it. We cannot afford to lose this election for the American people.”

Levin traces her political activism back to Franklin Roosevelt’s third term – the mid 1940s – as “just a kid, a really young kid.” Now, she is preparing to vote in her 19th presidential election, a record that traces back to just after World War II.

She has seen a lot. But nothing like switching candidates with little more than 100 days left, in a contest where she sees the stakes as so consequential.

“No, I’ve never experienced anything like this,” she said. “I’ve never seen anything like this.”","Two men are seated in a room with a framed picture of a woman on the wall, one man is wearing a dark suit and the other a polo shirt, both appear to be engaged in a conversation.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BCBF4D9C0>,2024-07-25 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/older-democrats-biden-harris-pennsylvania/index.html,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/783c8eadd9.png
df79db05c8,Reuters India,"India's Reliance, Bollywood fuel Ambani wedding hype through social media - Reuters India","MUMBAI, July 12 (Reuters) - Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani's son marries on Friday in a lavish ceremony that has been a hot talking point at home and abroad, with his father's $260 billion-conglomerate Reliance taking to social media to heavily publicise the event.

Reliance's efforts, coupled with posts from a host of Bollywood stars and coverage in media, have helped whip up public interest in the wedding, overshadowing some critical social media posts that have questioned the opulence at a time of growing inequality in India.

Ambani's youngest son Anant, 29, is marrying his long-time girlfriend Radhika Merchant, 29, in a star-studded ceremony in Mumbai that will be attended by celebrities and politicians, such as Kim Kardashian, Mike Tyson, Tony Blair and Boris Johnson. Three days of celebratory receptions will follow.

One unnamed executive at Reliance called the event a ""powerful symbol of India's growing stature on the global stage"".

""The presence of esteemed individuals highlights India's economic, political, intellectual, and scientific prowess,"" the note, shared with reporters, said.

Ambani, Asia's richest person, is famous for hosting lavish parties, especially for his three children Akash, Isha and Anant. International artists perform and a host of Bollywood stars usually attend the gatherings, whose price tag runs into the millions.

This promises to be the most extravagant of Ambani's galas so far, although it is not know how much was spent.

RELIANCE SHARES VIDEOS, PHOTOS

Some, such as opposition politician, Thomas Isaac have called the amount of spending ""obscene"".

""Legally it maybe their money but such ostentatious expenditure is a sin against mother earth and (the) poor,"" he said in a post on X.

The wedding functions have been deemed a public event, leading to traffic restrictions in a key Mumbai business district for four days, also raising public ire.

With access limited and details closely guarded, information meted out to the eager public has been done partly through Reliance's official Facebook page, which has 2.3 million followers.

The account shared video clips of dance performances and photographs to give a peek into the private celebrations.

Media access to the wedding venue was restricted on Friday night, with only a limited number of photographers and TV crew allowed to capture incoming guests.

Onlookers stood with umbrellas in rain outside the venue, some clicking pictures, with the sound of Bollywood audible from inside.

A foreign company executive in India, who is due to attend the Ambani wedding function this weekend, told Reuters function organisers will likely put tape on the phone camera of entering guests to ensure no pictures are taken.

Most of Ambani's celebrations are closely guarded.

The wedding events started in March with a three-day pre-wedding party with 1,200 guests and a performance by superstar Rihanna, followed by a European luxury cruise with 800 guests in May.

Days later, several Bollywood actresses posted photos on Instagram, sporting luxury designer labels, to their millions of followers, without any details of the Ambani cruise celebrations.

Such is the interest, Indian TV news channels are tracking the wedding minute-by-minute.

""The world descends ... Guest list to what's there to eat. Every minute detail on Times Now,"" the TV news channel's tickers said on Friday evening.

6fb100b7ad,The Globe and Mail,"Routliffe, Bennett produce double swim silver for Canada in Paralympic pool - The Globe and Mail","Tess Routliffe felt back where she belonged and Nicholas Bennett rose to the occasion for a pair of Paralympic Games silver medals in the pool Saturday.

Routliffe of Caledon, Ont., took silver in the women’s 200-metre individual medley eight years after the same result in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.

The 25-year-old didn’t compete in Tokyo three years ago because of a broken back she suffered when a barbell fell on her during a weight-training session.

“It’s been eight years since I've been at a Paralympic Games. That feeling is kind of indescribable,” Routliffe said. “I’m back in my happy place. I’m able to be Tess. I’m able to race.”

Bennett of Parksville, B.C., knocked over half a second off his previous best time in the men’s 200-metre freestyle to gain the first Paralympic medal of his career.

The 20-year-old, who is autistic, was beaten for gold by Britain’s William Ellard in a world-record time of one minute 51.30 seconds.

“It’s been two years since I dropped time in that race,” Bennett said.

“I’m actually ecstatic. I left everything in the pool and I’m currently feeling like I’m trying not to pass out. Absolutely gassed. There’s nothing left in the tank right now.”

Canada’s para swim team collected three medals in the first three days of racing at La Defense Arena, but awaited the first gold medal heading into Sunday.

Aurelie Rivard of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Que., was a bronze medalist in the 50-metre freestyle to open the meet.

Routliffe surged over the final 100 metres of the breaststroke and freestyle legs to vault from fifth to second behind victor Mallory Weggemann of the United States.

Routliffe passed Canadian teammate Danielle Dorris, who ran third with 50 metres to go but faded to sixth.

Dorris’s stronger event is still to come as the Moncton swimmer is the defending champion in the 50-metre butterfly.

“For Tess, having come from her Games in Rio, a silver medal in the same event, to Tokyo, breaking her back and not being able to compete, to coming here and performing the way she is, it’s incredible,” Dorris said.

“With Nick, I’m so happy for him as well. He had his first Games in Tokyo. He was just a little baby there, to now being an adult here and winning his first Paralympic medal.”

Routliffe was born with shortened limbs and Dorris with underdeveloped arms. They race the women’s SM7 classification. They kept each other relaxed in the ready room before racing each other Saturday.

“Just goofing off. She was dancing and I was laughing at her,” Dorris said.

Bennett was four-tenths of a second back of Ellard at the final turn, but the Brit pulled away with a mighty final 50.

“It’s anybody’s race until the end and he just went after it,” Bennett said. “That was a world-class swim for a world-class athlete.

“The last 50 is always the hardest for me.”

Bennett competes in the S14 class for athletes with an intellectual impairment. He’s coached by his sister Haley Bennett.

“I don’t think I'd be the athlete that I am without her,” Bennett said.

Routliffe’s sister Erin, who plays tennis for New Zealand, and Canada’s Gabriela Dabrowski are the defending U.S. Open women’s doubles champions. The duo was about to play a second-round match in New York following the swim race.

“She plays in like an hour. I have the day off tomorrow so I can watch Erin,” said Tess, who had the bulk of family members with her in Paris.

“This happens every four years. We were there last year. We supported her,” Routliffe said.

She’s the reigning world champion in the 100 breaststroke, which is Thursday.

“I was lucky to have the first two nights to watch, got to hear the crowd which is so loud, so insane,” Routliffe said.

“This France crowd is … it reminds me of Rio. It’s the Brazilians, but in French.”",A swimmer wearing a black swim cap with 'ROUTLIFFE' written on it is in the middle of a backstroke stroke in a pool.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x121 at 0x7D6BC79C8400>,2024-08-31 20:31:33.856000+00:00,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/article-routliffe-bennett-produce-double-swim-silver-for-canada-in-paralympic/,['Sports' 'International' 'National'],[0.95 0.85 0.8 ],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/6fb100b7ad.png
a316368881,The New York Times,Kennedy’s Campaign Is Accused of Lying About His New York Residency - The New York Times,"A group aligned with President Biden is challenging Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s New York ballot petition, saying his campaign lied about his New York residency.

The group, Clear Choice, says he long ago moved to the West Coast and has virtually no connection to the address listed on his petitions — an address of a longtime friend, where Mr. Kennedy’s independent presidential campaign acknowledges he has never actually lived.

The complaint, filed with the state Board of Elections on Thursday afternoon, is one of more than a dozen filed with New York’s board of elections, some of which object to his campaign’s signature-gathering efforts. The group provided a time-stamped copy of the complaint to The New York Times.

A Board of Elections spokeswoman, Kathleen McGrath, said a determination of residency would be “outside the ministerial scope” of the board’s review of petitions.

“I will note that the courts and a judicial proceeding would be the appropriate venue for challenging his residency,” she said.

Still, residency challenges are certain to stall Mr. Kennedy’s ballot access push in New York, and possibly elsewhere: He has used the same address in a number of other states where he is filing to run.

A particular concern is California, whose 54 electoral votes make it the biggest prize in the presidential election. Mr. Kennedy’s running mate, Nicole Shanahan, also lists California as her home, which adds another complication for Mr. Kennedy. Under a Constitutional quirk, presidential and vice-presidential candidates who hail from the same state are ineligible to receive its electoral votes.

On May 28, the Kennedy campaign said it had turned in more than 135,000 signatures with New York elections officials — three times the required 45,000 valid signatures to get on the ballot.

But the Board of Elections received 13 objections to the Kennedy petition, records show; those were followed up this week with more specific complaints.

In its challenges, Clear Choice cites property records, legal filings, news articles and a series of public statements establishing Mr. Kennedy’s current home as California. Because he claimed residency in New York, the group contends, his petitions list the wrong address for the candidate and therefore should all be thrown out.

“The objectors have proven and, will continue to prove, by clear and convincing evidence that candidate Kennedy violated New York State law when he listed the petition residence on his presidential petitions, and therefore candidate Kennedy should be barred from seeking the public office of president of the United States,” the group’s complaint says.

Mr. Kennedy has deep ties to New York. His campaign says he has been a permanent resident of the state since 1968, the year his father was assassinated in Los Angeles. In 1982, at age 27, he was hired as an assistant district attorney in Manhattan. He later worked for decades as an environmental lawyer for Riverkeeper, a nonprofit group dedicated to protecting and restoring the Hudson River.

His campaign insists his current address in Katonah, N.Y., is legitimately his official address.

“He receives mail there. His driver’s license is registered there. His automobile is registered there. His voting registration is from there,” the campaign said in a statement. “He pays rent to the owner.”

Mr. Kennedy owned property in Westchester County from the mid-1980s until at least 2012, when he sold a family estate in Bedford, about 40 miles north of Manhattan, records show. Earlier that year, his estranged wife, Mary Richardson Kennedy, died by suicide at the property while the two were locked in bitter divorce proceedings.

Since then Mr. Kennedy has been registered to vote at several addresses, including one belonging to his sister and others owned by friends, records show. The New York Post first reported on Mr. Kennedy’s claim of New York residency in May.

In 2023, he switched his listed address from the house of one friend to another in Westchester County, voting records show. The home he gave most recently as his address is on Croton Lake Road in Katonah. Its listed owner is a woman described in published reports as the wife of Mr. Kennedy’s longtime friend Timothy Haydock, a Westchester doctor. Mr. Haydock and Mr. Kennedy each served as best man in the other’s wedding.

“Mr. Kennedy’s best friend invited him to move into his Croton Lake Road residence in which Mr. Kennedy had been a frequent guest,” the campaign said in its statement. “Mr. Kennedy transferred his residence in June 2023.”

Mr. Kennedy bought property in Malibu, Calif., in 2014 with his third wife, the actress Cheryl Hines, according to The Daily Mail. But Mr. Kennedy’s campaign said he has always considered New York his permanent home, though he has lived elsewhere temporarily, including in California.","A man stands at a podium with a microphone, with the American flag and a flag with a circular emblem to his right, suggesting a political context.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x117 at 0x7D6BCAD10790>,2024-06-06 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/us/politics/rfk-jr-ny-residency-challenged.html,['Politics'],[0.95],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/a316368881.png
1366845ab9,Newsmax,Caroline Sunshine to Newsmax: Dems Should Just Sit This Election Out - Newsmax,"Caroline Sunshine, deputy communications director for the Trump campaign, told Newsmax on Monday that the Democrats should sit the 2024 presidential election out rather than run President Joe Biden because results from the latest surveys indicate he isn't likely to win.

""Much like President Trump was prepared to debate anytime, anyplace, anywhere, he's prepared to win anytime, anyplace, anywhere,"" Sunshine said during an appearance on ""Wake Up America."" ""And that's exactly what we're seeing. We couldn't be farther from a party in disarray and chaos. We are so proud to have President Trump as our nominee, as the leader of our party, and as the next president of our country. Look, my advice to the Democrat Party would be total surrender now. Save yourself millions of dollars. Do the right thing for the country. Just sit this presidential election out entirely because you are either stuck with Joe Biden at the top of your ticket, and anybody that you could hope to replace him with cannot beat President Trump, as we just saw in the latest round of polling.

""So, the American people are very clear about who they want,"" she continued. ""Your own voting base is very clear about who they want, and who they want is President Donald J. Trump back in the White House. I truly believe the American people wish that the election was tomorrow so that they could cast their vote for president Donald J. Trump immediately and get Joe Biden out of the Oval Office sooner rather than later, because it is very clear this is a man who is not fit to serve.""

Biden's physical and cognitive fitness have come under intense scrutiny since his widely-panned debate performance in late June against Trump. The president has thus far resisted calls to drop out of the 2024 race for the White House, including those from within his own party. He sat down with ABC's George Stephanopoulos on Friday to shore up support for his reelection bid as support among donors and Capitol Hill Democrats increasingly wanes.

Sunshine said it ""has been clear to the American people for years now that Joe Biden is weak and incompetent and in decline"" but the ""liberal mainstream media"" has worked to conceal the truth about the current commander in chief.

""There is no amount of interviews, there is no amount of PR spin and cleanup on aisle five, six, and seven that they can do to be the same people who, for years, said, 'Oh, Joe Biden is fine. He's sharp as a tack. He's doing cartwheels,'"" she said. ""Those same people do not now get to say, 'Let's go, Brandon,' if you know what I mean.""

3b77962a2d,Financial Times,Canadian bid for 7-Eleven owner likely to face US antitrust scrutiny - Financial Times,"US antitrust regulators are likely to challenge any proposal by Canadian retailer Alimentation Couche-Tard to combine with the Japanese operator of 7-Eleven, two people briefed on the matter said, over concerns a deal would increase prices for consumers and damage the labour market.

A tie-up between Couche-Tard, which operates the Circle K brand, and Japan’s Seven & i, which controls the world’s biggest convenience store chain, would create one of America’s largest retail chains.

The deal, which would be the biggest takeover of a Japanese company ever attempted by a foreign buyer, was also likely to draw scrutiny in Tokyo under the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act, said two M&A lawyers in Japan.

US regulators have yet to examine the details of any proposal as the two companies have not reached an agreement but people close to them said the deal was expected to come under scrutiny over its potential impact on shoppers.

“It’s still early to make an assessment as we don’t have an agreed deal but you can expect this deal to get challenged,” said a person close to top US regulators.

Another person said that if the two companies were to agree a deal they would have to offer significant remedies or divestitures to get US regulators’ approval.

A third person said a merger between Seven & i and Couche-Tard would be treated similarly to the $24.6bn deal between US supermarket giants Kroger and Albertsons. The Federal Trade Commission has sued to block the supermarket deal, alleging it would eliminate competition between the two companies, increase prices for groceries and harm product quality and consumer choice. On Monday Kroger sued the FTC to unblock the deal.

7-Eleven operates more than 12,500 convenience stores in the US, while Couche-Tard has more than 7,000 retail stores, according to data from food consultancy group Technomic.

Combined, they would control nearly 20,000 stores across most US states, which would be nearly 10 times more than the next biggest player, Casey’s, and employ more than 200,000 people.

Antitrust regulators in the US have been aggressive during the Biden administration, challenging deals in court as well as in public opinion, leading many companies to walk away from transactions for fear of being blocked.

Bankers close to Seven & i said they thought the feasibility of a takeover was low and cited scrutiny by both US regulators and potentially the Japanese government if the foreign takeover became politicised. Convenience stores in Japan are widely regarded as critical infrastructure in the event of an earthquake.

However, lawyers who have worked on large cross-border deals said antitrust objections from US regulators could be overcome by selling some stores. Couche-Tard might be able to satisfy the FTC through the sale of between 750 and 1,000 stores, said analysts at two funds.

Lina Khan, chair of the FTC, and Jonathan Kanter, head of antitrust at the US Department of Justice, have applied a more expansive approach to competition rules by focusing beyond the pricing of goods and services on all aspects of market power.

A combination of Couche-Tard and Seven & i would risk raising the prices of beverages and food items as well as limiting the choice of jobs and employers in certain markets where the two companies compete directly with one another, said people close to the regulators.

Although many on Wall Street hope that antitrust enforcement will be eased under a new Harris or Trump administration, both US presidential candidates are expected to give a clear mandate to regulators that any deals that increase inflation or cut jobs should be blocked.

cfc1ae2b29,Global News Toronto,Five things to watch in Paris on Sunday - Global News Toronto,"PARIS – From Canada’s women’s soccer playing under a massive six-point penalty to a chance for more medals in the pool, here are five things to look out for at the Paris Olympics on Sunday, July 28:

TRYING TO MOVE ON

Canada’s women’s soccer takes on host France in Saint-Étienne with its hopes of repeating as Olympic champions in serious doubt. FIFA stripped Canada of six points, the equivalent of two wins, as a result of the spying scandal that has cast a cloud over the start of the Games for Canada’s Olympic team. FIFA also banned head coach Bev Priestman and two other Canada staffers for one year and fined Canada Soccer 200,000 Swiss francs (C$313,000). The scandal erupted when two members of Canada’s staff were caught using a drone to film two New Zealand practices. Canada beat New Zealand 2-1 to open its tournament.

DEFENDING CHAMPION

Canada’s Maggie Mac Neil looks to defend her Olympic title when she swims in the women’s 100-metre butterfly final. The 24-year-old from London, Ont., finished third in her semifinal on Saturday and tied for the fourth-best qualifying time. Canada is looking for more hardware in the pool after Toronto’s Summer McIntosh won silver in Saturday’s women’s 400-metre freestyle.

DREAM TEAM 2024

The star-studded United States men’s basketball team plays its first game at the Paris Olympics when it takes on Serbia at the Pierre-Mauroy Stadium near Lille. The Americans say they hope to have Kevin Durant in the lineup. He missed all of his team’s exhibition matches with a calf strain. Even if Durant can’t go, the U.S. will have a formidable lineup on display led by LeBron James, Stephen Curry and Joel Embiid. The Serbian roster includes Denver Nuggets superstar Nikola Jokic.

Today a look at Trump's immunity claims in Appeals Court, plus we're learning more about Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's health. And can Nikki Haley close the gap in New Hampshire? We have new polling numbers. Prep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide ♦ Former President Donald Trump and his lawyer John Sauer were in Federal Appeals Court yesterday. Trump's legal team argues that he is immune to federal charges of conspiring to interfere in the 2020 election, because his actions took place while he was president. I caught up with USA TODAY Justice Department Correspondent Bart Jansen for the latest. Bart, as always, thanks for making the time. Bart Jansen: Thanks for having me. Taylor Wilson: So Bart, Donald Trump's lawyer was in Federal Appeals Court yesterday. Can you remind us what this appeal center's on? What's that issue here? Bart Jansen: Well, and it wasn't just his lawyer, Trump himself showed up at the courthouse, because the case is pretty important to him. This was an appeal of a decision involving the federal charges that he conspired to interfere with the results of the 2020 election. So he faces these federal charges. The trial is scheduled for March 4th. He thinks the charges should be dismissed, because as president, when the events took place, he deserves immunity for anything he might've done. And so, the three judge panel at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is going to mull his arguments and we'll get a decision that either the trial will continue, or that the charges could potentially be dismissed. Taylor Wilson: And so what did Trump's lawyer argue in court specifically on Tuesday? Bart Jansen: He argued basically that the Constitution and the founders who drafted it wanted to protect the president from political adversaries who might try to bring criminal charges after a person left office, to punish the person for actions they took as president. So, that a president, if he was worried about actions he was taking or policies that he pursued, contentious stuff that he did, if he was worried that he might be charged criminally sometime down the road, that presidents might be inhibited and it might limit their power. So, Trump's lawyer, John Sauer, argued that you can't allow criminal charges, because they might be just filed willy-nilly. He said if you allow charges in Trump's case that it could open a Pandora's box for the future of the country that could never be closed again. Taylor Wilson: And Bart, do we have any previous examples of federal courts ruling on charging a former president? Bart Jansen: Well, it's pretty new ground and that's why whatever gets decided in this case is going to be a landmark decision. Whatever this three judge panel decides will almost certainly be appealed to eventually the Supreme Court, so we're probably going to get a final answer on this. One question about that is how soon you get a final answer, Trump would prefer to delay the trial if it is held until after the election. We're still trying to see whether all of this could be resolved before the election. The federal courts really haven't dealt with this decision directly. We do have some Supreme Court decisions that dealt with civil actions against presidents, whether they could be sued while they are in office. And there's a significant case a few decades ago in which they said presidents are protected from civil lawsuits while they're in office, because again, they didn't want presidents to be distracted from their official duties by what could potentially be just a flood of civil litigation over actions that they've taken. But the courts really haven't ruled directly on whether a president could be exposed to criminal charges, and in this case, particularly a former president facing criminal charges. There is an argument from prosecutors, under Justice Department Special Counsel Jack Smith, that Trump, as a former president, it doesn't matter whether he is charged at all, because it wouldn't influence an administration. It wouldn't change any policies he could embark upon. It's just they think that he broke some laws and that he ought to be held accountable as any other person might be. And so they want to argue, even though Trump served four years as commander in chief, that that doesn't give him basically a get out of jail card for the rest of his life. Taylor Wilson: All right. Bart Janssen, covers the Justice Department for USA TODAY. Thanks as always, Bart. Bart Jansen: Thanks for having me. ♦ Taylor Wilson: The Pentagon disclosed yesterday that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has been hospitalized since January 1st, because of complications from prostate cancer surgery. The surgery led to a severe infection that has hospitalized him at Walter Reed National Medical Center, according to a statement from his doctors released by the Pentagon. His surgery took place on December 22nd and was minimally invasive and uneventful, according to his doctors.

d594f169a8,Reuters,Biden faces growing doubts from Democrats about his 2024 re-election - Reuters,"WASHINGTON, July 2 (Reuters) - Some elected Democrats loyal to President Joe Biden raised fresh questions on Tuesday about his 2024 re-election bid, with one calling for him to step aside, a shift after many defended him in the wake of last week's shaky debate performance.

Whether Biden continues his 2024 bid for president after his halting debate performance against Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is largely his decision, Democrats and political strategists have said.

But Biden is under pressure. Some donors have called for him to step aside, and other Democrats are worrying openly that he is not equipped to beat Trump in November.

There are 25 Democratic members of the House of Representatives preparing to call for Biden to step aside if he seems shaky in coming days, according to one House Democratic aide.

A second House Democratic aide said moderate House Democrats in competitive districts - often called ""frontliners"" - were getting hammered with questions in their districts this week.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll taken after the debate showed one in three Democrats think Biden should end his re-election bid.

U.S. Representative Lloyd Doggett became the first congressional Democrat to call for Biden to withdraw from the presidential race on Tuesday. He told NBC News in an interview that he hoped other Democratic lawmakers would follow his lead.

""It looks like the dam has broken,"" the second aide said.

Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi emphasized Biden's multiple legislative accomplishments during an interview with MSNBC Tuesday but said it was legitimate to ask whether his debate performance was a one-night thing or a broader health problem. She said Trump should be given the same scrutiny.

""I think it's a legitimate question to say, 'Is this an episode or is this a condition?' And so when people ask that question, it's legitimate, of both candidates,"" Pelosi said.

Immediately after the debate, Pelosi had shown strong support. ""Joe Biden’s decision to go forward is a decision that we will all embrace because of the record he has and the performance that will come with it,"" she said then.

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Tuesday that Biden did not have an ""episode,"" just a bad night.

Vice President Kamala Harris, asked in a CBS News interview about Doggett's demand, said: ""Look, Joe Biden is our nominee. We beat Trump once and we're gonna beat him. Period.""

Biden, speaking at a campaign event in Virginia on Tuesday evening without a teleprompter, blamed his performance on a lack of sleep and said his campaign had raised $38 million since the debate.

“The fact is that you know, I wasn’t very smart. I decided to travel around the world a couple times, going through around 100 time zones ... before ... the debate. Didn’t listen to my staff and came back and nearly fell asleep on stage,"" he said. ""That's no excuse but it is an explanation.”

Some Democrats suggested Biden should be thinking about the broader party's future.

""He has to be honest with himself,"" Democratic Representative Mike Quigley, a moderate from Illinois, told CNN on Tuesday. ""It's his decision. I just want him to appreciate at this time just how much it impacts, not just his race, but all the other races coming in November.""

U.S. Representative Jim Clyburn, the Democrat often credited with securing Biden's nomination in the 2020 presidential race, told MSNBC Tuesday he would support Vice President Kamala Harris to be the Democratic nominee if Biden stepped aside.

Representative Jared Golden, a Maine Democrat, predicted on Tuesday that Trump would win the election, as did Washington state Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez.

BIDEN TO TALK TO GOVERNORS, CONGRESS

The president and his campaign are scrambling to bolster support. Biden will hold a meeting with Democratic governors virtually and in person at the White House on Wednesday and speak to lawmakers this week, White House officials said.

One of the House Democratic aides said members were disappointed about the lack of outreach thus far.

Doggett told NBC News he had asked the White House to speak personally with Biden about his call for him to drop out, but had not heard back from him.

Biden's campaign held difficult phone calls on Sunday and Monday with important funders who questioned his plans to stay in the race.

Asked Tuesday why Biden had not done more media interviews or press conferences after his debate raised questions, Jean-Pierre pointed to his visit to a Waffle House in Atlanta on the evening of the debate and subsequent interactions with supporters.

Biden is scheduled to do an interview with ABC this week and plans to hold a news conference at the NATO summit next week. The Democratic Hill aide said a lot was riding on the ABC interview, with lawmakers looking to see that he can handle rapid-fire questions and not just orchestrated campaign appearances.

Meanwhile, Biden's campaign said it and its Democratic allies raised $264 million in the second quarter, including $127 million in June and a record ""grassroots"" fundraising haul on the day of Biden's debate.

8e34dead67,The Guardian,Tory conference could be like a wake as business stays away - The Guardian,"Businesses are expected to cancel their attendance at this year’s Conservative conference in unprecedented numbers, in a chastening snub that could also undermine the party’s ability to raise funds.

The annual gathering, due to be held in Birmingham from 29 September to 2 October, would usually attract corporate attendees willing to pay tens of thousands of pounds to get close to MPs with influence over policy.

But Labour’s landslide general election victory means this year’s event is on track to be the least popular in living memory, according to several public affairs firms and business leaders.

They said the conference was likely to be less well attended by business leaders than the one held after Tony Blair’s 1997 victory and even Labour conferences under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership.

“The lack of appetite among business for the Conservative party conference is no doubt fuelled not just by the attractiveness of Labour, but also a realisation that the Conservative party is at a real inflection point,” said Katherine Morgan, head of public affairs for Europe at the global advisory group DGA.

“The challenge for the Conservatives will be ensuring that September marks the beginning of the journey towards re-establishing their credentials as ‘the party of business’.”

Several large agencies are understood to have cancelled dinners they were due to host at the event or scaled back the number of people they are sending.

One firm contacted said that only one company out of its 70 clients was planning to have a presence in Birmingham.

Jon McLeod, a partner at the strategic communications consultancy DRD Partnership, said: “While the Labour conference will be the bunfight of bunfights, with corporates piling in from all directions, there is something to be said for a low-key presence at the Tory conference this year if only to take the temperature on what direction the party is set to take once it rises from the ashes.”

Another leading public relations executive, who asked not to be named, said they had spoken to two corporate clients about their possible attendance. “One said they had no interest, the other is going but said it’s going to be ‘like a wake’,” the adviser said.

Any significant drop-off in numbers would be likely to exacerbate the Conservative party’s funding problems, after a raft of mega-donors switched loyalties in the run-up to the election.

One leading figure in the tourism and hospitality sector, who asked not to be named, said: “There isn’t much to be gained from corporates being there,” adding that the resulting loss of income would hurt the party.

“There’s a funding issue. There will be some things pre-contracted that they’ll hold people to. Some [businesses] may be tied in to attending and may not want to do it now.

“I’d expect this conference to be the lowest attendance I can remember. Even in ‘97 it wasn’t catastrophically bad.”

The party charges fees for events and exhibition stands, with prices set out in a brochure that includes a foreword from Richard Holden, who was party chairman when it was written but has since resigned that post after nearly losing his seat at the election.

Each ticket to the conference’s dedicated “business day” (Monday 30 September this year) sells for £3,500, while booking rooms such as the Churchill Theatre and the Thatcher Theatre can cost up to £10,000. Firms who want a stand in the exhibition hall can pay up to £55,000.

The latest accounts for the party, from 2022, show that it spent £4.3m on its conference that year and made £6.3m, a notional profit of £2m.

“[Conferences] are valuable to all parties,” said Fraser Raleigh, head of public affairs at communications firm SEC Newgate. “You saw that during the pandemic when they couldn’t meet physically. The parties see them as important fundraising moments.

“I think people are looking at their plans and thinking about whether to send fewer people. Given that these things are priced quite far in advance, I’m not sure refunds are likely to happen.”

He said the conference could be saved from total desolation if businesses see it as a chance to get close to the party’s next leader. “There’ll be some political interest if, as it looks like it might, the leadership contest is coming to a crescendo at that point, if conference is used as the hustings for the final two.

“Labour are in a commanding position but volatility of voter loyalty has been growing so it would not be wise for business to assume the state of things now will be the state of things for ever.”

A Tory party spokesperson said they were not concerned about attendance levels at this year’s event. “The Conservative party conference will be returning in full force this year, including its business day,” they said.

“So far we have already seen significant interest in this, with high demand for tickets and partnerships and a full exhibition hall. Business day partnerships in particular are already significantly up on last year’s conference.”

If attendance does fall, the leadership contest triggered by Rishi Sunak standing down after his election could limit any impact on local bars, hotels and restaurants in the Westside district where the conference will be held.

Mike Olley, general manager of the Westside Business Improvement District, said: “When they first came they were looking down their noses at people. Since then, they’re a decent bunch. They spend well and they’re not a bunch of Hooray Henrys any more.

“I don’t think that to us we’ll see a turndown in numbers. That’s more about the people who put the trade stands on.

“The trade hall won’t be packed maybe, but plenty of businesses will turn up because they know they’ll be back in power eventually.”","A man in a suit waves to the crowd at a conference, with a woman in a red jacket and a man in a suit in the background.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BC774EB90>,2024-07-23 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/23/tory-conference-birmingham-attendance-business-fundraising,['Politics' 'Business and Finance'],[0.9 0.7],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/8e34dead67.png
d43e55fbba,The Washington Post,"Amid tension, U.S. and China defense chiefs hold first meeting in two years - The Washington Post","SINGAPORE — In an effort to de-escalate rising tensions between two world powers, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Friday had his first meeting with his Chinese counterpart in two years, as the Chinese military has ramped up its aggression around Taiwan and in the South China Sea.

The meeting, held on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, a regional security summit, saw Austin and Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun agree to work toward better communications to stabilize military relations and avert crises, according to a statement from the Defense Department. The United States and China will “convene a crisis-communications working group by the end of the year.”

The two also traded accusations of blame for recent tensions between Beijing and Taipei, with Austin expressing concern over China’s launch of large-scale military exercises close to Taiwan’s airspace and maritime territory, soon after Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te’s inauguration last week.

Dong accused the United States of sending “seriously wrong signals” to “separatist forces” in Taiwan.

Although the meeting yielded no major announcements, it was “long overdue,” said Zhou Bo, a retired senior colonel in the Chinese military who is now at Tsinghua University in Beijing.

Zhou said he feared Taiwan’s Lai would prove more “provocative” than his predecessor, compelling China to carry out even more military exercises around Taiwan, and creating “a new status quo that Washington doesn’t want to see.”

The United States maintains unofficial relations with Taiwan but does not recognize it as an independent state. However, U.S. policy opposes any Chinese action to take Taiwan — which China considers its territory — by force, and allows for the United States to arm Taiwan and defend it.

China cut off high-level military-to-military dialogue with the United States in 2022 to protest a visit to Taiwan by Nancy Pelosi, at that time the House speaker. Communications resumed in November when President Biden met Chinese leader Xi Jinping in California.

The United States has been pushing China on the necessity of such regular exchanges to prevent an accident or military miscalculation in the region from spiraling into a crisis. This is particularly important in the South China Sea, where Beijing is engaged in standoffs related to territorial disputes with American allies like the Philippines, and amid escalating Chinese military activity around Taiwan.

Both sides said the 75-minute meeting represented progress toward a stabilized relationship. Wu Qian, a spokesman for China’s Ministry of National Defense, called it “positive, pragmatic and constructive.” The United States underscored China’s commitment to resume theater-level telephone conversations within months and convene the working group on crisis communications before the end of the year.

“It’s vitally important,” said Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), who attended the conference with a delegation of U.S. lawmakers. “We went through a period where Secretary Austin tried to call and nobody answered the phone. We need to have regular contact between our militaries. And I do think it’s important for us to be on the record with one another with where we stand.”

But there was no sign of a breakthrough on the most contentious issues in the relationship.

Austin expressed concern about the Chinese drills that surrounded Taiwan, days after Lai was sworn in. “[China] should not use Taiwan’s political transition — part of a normal, routine democratic process — as a pretext for coercive measures,” he said.

Dong reprimanded Washington for sending congratulations and a delegation to the inauguration, and urged the United States to “take concrete actions to correct its mistakes,” Wu said.

The standoff over Taiwan and the South China Sea, where China says it is merely patrolling its territory, and where Biden has promised a U.S. response to any attacks on Philippine forces or ships, has presented the most formidable obstacles to a détente.

“We don’t want to fight. But there are issues on which … it’s to some extent, intractable,” Adm. Samuel Paparo, the commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, said Friday during a panel discussion.

Cui Tiankai, a former vice minister of China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who spoke alongside Paparo suggested that the United States was the true aggressor in the South China Sea.

“I don’t think anyone should have the illusion that they could easily violate Chinese sovereignty and integrity without any cost,” Cui said.

The Chinese are also skeptical of the crisis hotline established by Xi and Biden, said Zhao Minghao, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai.

“China wants crisis prevention while the United States prioritizes crisis management, which sounds to China like all these communication channels are only going to make the United States feel emboldened to create new crises with impunity,” he said.

Dong, a 63-year-old former head of the Chinese navy, was appointed in December, replacing Li Shangfu four months after he abruptly disappeared from public view.

The reshuffle is part of a broader campaign by Xi as he seeks to root out corruption and streamline the command structure to turn the People’s Liberation Army into a “world-class” force, able to go toe-to-toe with the United States.

As defense minister, Dong is primarily responsible for military diplomacy. Operations and strategy are set by Xi and senior members of the Chinese Communist Party’s Central Military Commission. Dong, unlike his predecessor, is not a member of the commission — a fact that some of the congressional Republicans attending pointed to as potentially limiting the effectiveness of the meeting.

“It is important to recognize, and I know secretary does, that this guy is not the equivalent of Secretary Austin at all,” said Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), who co-led the Senate delegation with Duckworth. “He’s called the defense minister, but in terms of the power structure of that country and that government, and the Communist Party, he’s not really even a player.”

Navigating China’s rise and its increased frustration at the American presence in areas Beijing considers its backyard has become a challenging exercise for countries in Southeast and East Asia, especially among those that want to strengthen economic ties with China while also relying on the United States for defense.

“Managing the anxiety over China’s coercion while being bullish over its economic prospects is now a constant preoccupation for many policymakers” in the region, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the London-based think tank that organizes the Shangri-La Dialogue, said in its annual assessment of regional security priorities released Friday.

While Beijing’s assertiveness has drawn pushback from some, it has also successfully deepened its economic and security relationship with others, like Cambodia. U.S. officials have accused China of building a secret naval base in northern Cambodia, though both countries deny it.

9ecff4f64b,Newsweek,American Baffled As 'Insect Bite' From 2018 Vacation Is Only Getting Worse - Newsweek,"What began as a seemingly harmless insect bite during a 2018 vacation in Costa Rica has turned into an ongoing medical mystery for Cynthia Bravo, a 39-year-old mother and realtor from Valencia, California. Despite multiple consultations with doctors over the years, Bravo's skin condition continues to worsen, leaving her and her TikTok followers desperate for answers.

""In 2018, I went to Tamarindo, Costa Rica, and on my third day, I woke up with a mild cough and some congestion,"" Bravo told Newsweek. ""When I got home, I noticed a few red bumps on my arm that looked like bug bites."" Initially diagnosed as sand fly bites, Bravo's condition has worsened over the years despite multiple consultations with various doctors.

Bravo first sought medical advice shortly after returning home. The doctor she visited suggested cryotherapy, but the red bumps remained. In 2019, a dermatologist dismissed the condition as minor bug bites that would resolve on their own. However, the bumps persisted and worsened. Another dermatologist performed a biopsy in 2020, which also concluded they were bug bites that would disappear on their own. The only thing the doctor suggested was a chemical peel for scarring, which Bravo declined.

Throughout this period, Bravo consulted several other doctors, all of whom were unsure about the condition but assured her it was not dangerous. In 2022, during a pregnancy, her OB-GYN also reviewed her biopsy results and confirmed the condition would not affect her baby, but also apologized for not being able to tell her what it was.

The situation took a frustrating turn in May of this year when Bravo's primary care physician quickly diagnosed her with eczema without carrying out any additional tests on her. ""She prescribed me Triamcinolone Acetonide Ointment USP 0.5%,"" Bravo said. ""I have not used or plan to use it without proper diagnosis confirmed by proper testing.""

Dr. Salar Hazany, a board-certified dermatologist at the Scar Healing Institute of Beverly Hills, told Newsweek: ""I have not seen or diagnosed this patient, but it looks like this woman might have sporotrichosis, which is caused by a prick from a thorn of a plant, likely a rose plant. Other exotic fungi and bacteria can have sporotrichoid spread. They are hard to culture and see in biopsy.""

The World Health Organization (WHO) previously wrote that sporotrichosis is an infection under the skin caused by different species of the fungus Sporothrix, which occurs sporadically in tropical and subtropical countries.

Sporotrichosis can be transmitted through plant debris or through animal transmission, such as scratches from cats. WHO added that its diagnosis depends on demonstrating fungal scrapings or curettings from lesions or biopsy material.

Dr. Hazany recommended itraconazole for treatment, noting that a skin biopsy may not easily reveal the organisms causing sporotrichosis. ""The definitive diagnostic method is fungal tissue culture, which generally provides results within 3-5 days,"" he added.

Bravo has tried various remedies, including tea tree oil, castor oil, and even a parasite cleanse, all suggested by her supportive TikTok community, where she originally shared the post in April under the username cynlza. She plans to continue advocating for a thorough diagnosis and proper treatment.

""Many of my TikTok followers have suggested lots of possibilities and remedies,"" Bravo said. ""The TikTok community has been very supportive, and thousands are now following my journey as we all want to know what is on or in my arm.""

Bravo's determination highlights the challenges many face in the healthcare system, especially when dealing with persistent, undiagnosed conditions. Her story underscores the importance of advocating for oneself and seeking multiple opinions when faced with medical uncertainty.

The video quickly went viral on social media, getting viewers from across TikTok. It has so far received over 962,200 views and 23,500 likes on the platform.","A woman with a black tank top and sunglasses is holding up her arm showing red, inflamed skin.

1d555df8c6,USA TODAY,"'I am ashamed': Hallie Biden gives emotional testimony on finding Hunter Biden's gun, using drugs - USA TODAY","Hallie Biden, the widow of Beau Biden who also dated Hunter Biden after her husband's death, gave emotional testimony on Thursday about finding the gun at the center of his felony trial.

Hunter Biden faces felony chargesover whether he lied on a federal gun form in 2018 that asked if he was addicted to drugs

Hallie Biden took the stand in the Delaware courthouse where Hunter Biden is on trial in a much anticipated testimony given under the promise of immunity.

She said Hunter introduced her to crack cocaine, but she stopped using the drug after a few months and tried to help the president's youngest son stay sober. She was cleaning out his car when she found the gun he purchased in 2018, she said on the stand. While Hallie Biden threw the gun away at a Delaware store after discovering it, it was later recovered by law enforcement officers.

Here is what to know about her potentially pivotal testimony:

Hunter Biden trial live updates:Joe Biden says he wouldn't pardon his son in gun case

Hallie Biden and Hunter Biden began dating after Beau Biden's death

Hunter's late brother Beau Biden died of cancer at age 46 in 2015. After Beau's death, Hunter connected with Beau's widow Hallie romantically.

“It was gradual,” she told the jury about their relationship as of late 2015 or 2016. She also mentioned he drank alcohol while using crack cocaine.

Hallie and Hunter tried to live together, but the relationship fell apart, according to Hunter Biden's memoir.

""It was a giant miscalculation on both our parts, errors in judgment born of a uniquely tragic time,"" he wrote in the 2021 book, titled ""Beautiful Things,"" explaining how they tried unsuccessfully to get back together later in a period of sobriety. ""It felt like a failure of epic proportions.""

'I am ashamed:' Hallie Biden said she used drugs with Hunter

Hallie Biden testified Thursday that she visited Hunter Biden in California in June 2018, telling the jury Hunter Biden was using crack cocaine at that time.

Prodded by prosecutors, she told the jury that by then, she also had started using crack cocaine and was introduced to it by Hunter Biden.

“It was a terrible experience that I went through, and I am embarrassed, and I am ashamed, and I regret that period of my life,” she told the jury.

She said she stopped using the drug in August 2018.

Hallie Biden addressed Hunter Biden's drug use during weeks surrounding gun purchase

Hallie Biden walked the jury through a series of text messages in the days after Hunter Biden purchased the gun on Oct. 12, 2018.

“Why won’t you answer my calls,” she texted him. He replied in a text Oct. 13, stating that he was behind a baseball stadium in Wilmington “waiting on a dealer named Mookie.”

The next day, she texted him stating she tried calling him “500 times in the past 24 hours.” He eventually responded: “I was sleeping on a car smoking crack on 4th Street and Rodney.”

This evidence is important to prosecutors because defense attorneys have sought to argue Hunter Biden was not using drugs during the period in which he purchased the gun, meaning that he didn't have to report his drug use on the federal gun form.

In opening arguments, Hunter Biden's lawyer Abbe Lowell sought to explain those messages by saying that Hunter Biden would sometimes lie to Hallie Biden about his location because he did not want to be with her at the time.

But during Thursday's proceedings, the defense attorney spent hours questioning Hallie Biden on these messages, eliciting that Hallie Biden didn’t know if Hunter Biden was actually waiting or a drug dealer nor whether he was smoking crack in the area.

Lowell also questioned her on the moments leading up to when she found the gun less than two weeks later, asking about her memories around that time.

Hallie Biden said she panicked when she found Hunter Biden's gun

Hallie Biden told the jury Thursday that in the moments before she found Hunter Biden's gun, she was not certain that what she saw in his car was drugs and couldn’t remember any exact paraphernalia. She also said under cross-examination that she did not see Hunter Biden using drugs in early October.

Hallie Biden told jurors she would regularly clean out Hunter Biden’s vehicle to “help him get or stay sober.”

However, on the morning of Oct. 23, 2018, the car was parked beside her home, and she searched it and she said she believed that she found “some remnants of crack cocaine and paraphernalia.”

“Oh, and the gun, obviously,” she told the jury a moment later.

Prosecutors asked her to identify what remnants she found, and she told the jury, “a dusting of powder.” She said the gun was located in the “center console” of the car. “I panicked and wanted to get rid of them,” she said.

She said she didn’t want him to have it and she didn’t want her kids to find it. Hallie Biden and Beau Biden had two children together.

Hunter Biden's attorneys concede that he struggled with drug addiction before and after purchasing the weapon, but they have argued that prosecutors cannot prove that he knowingly deceived the gun shop when filling out the form − which is required to convict him.

To that end, his defense has sought to build a wall around the October period in which Hunter Biden purchased the gun, arguing in opening statements the evidence will show he ""was not using when he bought the gun.""

Hallie Biden trashes Hunter Biden's gun

After finding Hunter Biden’s .38-caliber revolver, Hallie Biden said she panicked and was afraid to touch it.

She went inside her home and grabbed a gift bag but realized the gun was still visible in the small bag. So she put it inside a leather pouch and then inside the bag, drove to a local grocery store and threw it in an outdoor trash can.

“I realized it was a stupid idea now, but I was just panicking,” Hallie Biden told the jury.

She didn’t remember exactly how, but Hunter Biden found out about her choiced and told her to return to find the gun. Hallie Biden walked the jury through this tense exchange through text messages.

“Did you take that from me Hallie? Are you insane … ” Hunter Biden said in a text the day after she threw it in a grocery store trash can.

“It’s hard for me to believe anyone is that stupid,” Hunter Biden texted. “Do you want me dead?” he asked in a later text.

“I’m sorry. I just want you to be safe. That was not safe,” Hallie Biden texted back.

When Hallie Biden went back, the gun was gone, she said. She went inside the store to see if they had removed the trash and eventually filed a police report with the help of one of the employees.

“I was so flustered,” she testified.","A woman in a black car with sunglasses on, smiling and looking out the window.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6B7E491510>,2024-06-06 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.usatoday.com,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/06/06/hunter-biden-beau-biden-hallie-biden-gun-trial-drug-use/74005749007/,['Politics' 'National'],[0.85 0.8 ],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/1d555df8c6.png
388a709981,Financial Times,Germany to launch limited military service in push to be ‘war ready’ - Financial Times,"Germany is to reintroduce a limited form of military service, though the plan falls far short of the defence ministry’s original goal of restoring the system of conscription scrapped 13 years ago.

“Everyone must ask themselves what they’d be prepared to do if we were attacked,” said defence minister Boris Pistorius on Wednesday. “The question is . . . how do we secure our civilian life if war breaks out?”

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted Germany to take a much more robust approach to defence, investing heavily in its armed forces and preparing to station an armoured brigade in Lithuania — its first permanent foreign deployment since the second world war.

Pistorius has said the Bundeswehr, the German armed forces, must be made “war ready” as concerns increase about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggressive intentions towards Nato, the western military alliance.

Defence ministry officials described the minister’s model, which borrows heavily from a system used by Sweden, as a “selective form of military service based on a voluntary principle but containing obligatory elements if necessary”.

Under the plan, men aged 18 will be required to fill out a form with information about their willingness and ability to serve in the army and then, if selected, to undergo a medical examination. Recruits will then be chosen from those tested.

But opposition politicians expressed disappointment with the proposal. “Considering the minister has been talking about [reintroducing] military service for nine months, the plans are pretty thin and vague,” said Serap Güler, the Christian Democrats’ spokesperson on defence.

Former chancellor Angela Merkel scrapped the military draft in 2011, but the Bundeswehr has since struggled to overcome persistent troop shortages.

The government has plans to increase the size of the army from 182,000 to 203,000 by 2031. But military officials believe it needs as many as 460,000 soldiers to defend Germany in the event of an attack.

Pistorius said his plan would lead to the recruitment of 200,000 reservists — in addition to the 60,000 the Bundeswehr currently has.

Of the 400,000 18-year-olds who would be approached by the Bundeswehr under his plan every year, he estimated about a quarter would likely express an interest in serving. Of these, 40,000 to 50,000 would be invited to undergo a medical examination.

“We will select the most motivated, the fittest and the most suitable,” Pistorius said.

He noted the Bundeswehr only had the capacity to train 5,000 additional recruits a year, though that number would rise in the coming years.

The armed forces had shrunk significantly since the end of the cold war, he said, leading to the divestment of barracks, munition dumps and military accommodation “on a massive scale”, he said.

Those who sign up will be offered six months of basic training which can be extended to a total of 23 months of service. Recruits will then become part of the reserve force, with an obligation to undergo annual training.

Pistorius’s more ambitious plans, including a scheme to bring back compulsory military service, encountered strong resistance from military chiefs, who were wary about an influx of raw, untrained young men, and leftwing politicians in his Social Democrat (SPD) party, who feel uneasy about Germany’s new focus on the military.

Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who like Pistorius is from the SPD, in May said he considered a return to a conscript army “unworkable”.

The ministry then shifted to a hybrid service model, which would not involve mass compulsory service but would instead be aimed at encouraging more voluntary participation. Pistorius was keen to emulate the kind of national service models used in many Scandinavian countries.

The Bundeswehr hopes the model will improve recruitment by identifying potential candidates and encouraging enrolment, through a range of incentives and training opportunities, in understaffed niche fields such as cyber security and medicine.","A group of soldiers in camouflage uniforms stand in formation with rifles, in front of a military vehicle with a German flag.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BCA9CD840>,2024-06-12 16:33:21.739000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/4d6729f5-bc23-428a-a372-080b36c80e4d,['Politics' 'International'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/388a709981.png
9a12f8e9ee,Global News,"Ford government close to completing Greenbelt checklist, key recommendation will go to committee - Global News","It was a set of recommendations to ensure that the Greenbelt scandal, a controversial chapter in Ontario’s political history, would never happen again.

A detailed investigation by Ontario’s auditor general into the government’s decision to remove 15 parcels of protected land from the Greenbelt resulted in 15 recommendations for systems-wide improvement.

As the one-year anniversary of that report approaches, the Ford government says it has completed all but one of the recommendations – quick work that the government hopes will help turn the page on the bruising scandal.

“We’re well on our way moving forward,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said at an unrelated news conference on Tuesday. “We’re going to keep moving forward building homes everywhere other than the Greenbelt.”

But remnants of the Greenbelt scandal continue to linger over a government that is under an active RCMP investigation into whether the decision-making process rose to the level of criminality.

In Part 2 of a three-part anniversary series, Global News looks into the auditor’s recommendations, the government’s progress and the police investigation.

On the day the auditor general found certain developers had received “preferential treatment” and could benefit to the tune of $8 billion from the Greenbelt policy, Ford held a news conference.

“The buck stops with me and I take full responsibility for the need for a better process,” Ford said.

The premier immediately accepted 14 of the 15 recommendations from the auditor general, which included stopping staff from using personal emails to communicate, avoiding confidentiality agreements that she believed tied civil servants in straight jackets and a severe tightening of conflict of interest rules in his government.

Ford initially refused to reverse the Greenbelt plan, despite the auditor general’s suggestion he do so. After just over a month, and several high-profile resignations, the premier apologized and accepted all of the suggestions the auditor general had sent his way, including scrapping his Greenbelt policy.

Soon after, as the province tried to distance itself from the decision-making the Ford government stopped talking about its progress, working behind the scenes to action the demands. Some critics feel the lack of public updates raised questions about the premier’s commitment.

Ontario Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie said she did not trust Ford and his government to complete the recommendations set out for them by the auditor general.

“People should not trust Doug Ford to do what he’s saying he’s doing,” she told Global News.

“What we need is a government who will have ethics in their governance, who will be transparent and accountable to the people, not just stand up and apologize and move on.”

Crombie called on the province to release “the evidence” of its progress toward completing the vast majority of the auditor general’s recommendations in the interest of “accountability.”

The lapses in processes and judgement highlighted by the auditor general’s report, along with the direct influence held by developers over some government decisions, kept the integrity commissioner busy for months.

The Ford government shared a document with Global News listing the 15 recommendations and chronicling the steps it had taken to address them.

First, as it sought to respond to the scandal, the government requested an investigation into former housing minister Steve Clark’s chief of staff, Ryan Amato, from the integrity commissioner.

Both the integrity commissioner and the auditor general painted Amato as a central figure in the scandal, suggesting he had led the Greenbelt land removal process, with minimal input from Ford or Clark.

Amato did not respond to a request for an interview from Global News, while Clark said he supports the government’s work on the auditor general’s recommendations and said he was “pleased that we are well on our way to completing them.”

Next, the integrity commissioner was brought in for a fresh round of ethics training. He met with senior political staff on Oct. 26, 2023, to “reinforce” ethics training, doing the same again on Feb. 14 and 16, 2024.

The government said other recommendations, including tracking how often confidentiality agreements are used and creating a central digital system where staff must upload anything given to them by lobbyists, have also been completed.

The latter recommendation comes after the auditor general’s investigation found political staff were being handed direct requests to remove land from the Greenbelt.

Under the new process, introduced in February, staff are told to “upload materials received from lobbyists and third-party stakeholders that have been, or are being considered in the process of decision-making.” The data is then reviewed weekly by chiefs of staff, according to the premier’s office.

On Wednesday, Ford stressed the majority of recommendations had been completed, including reversing the Greenbelt decision after months of pressure.

“There’s 15 recommendations, we’ve taken 14 of them, implemented them and we’re working on the 15th one,” Ford said.

The final recommendation the government is yet to complete is a wide-reaching review of lobbying laws in Ontario. The auditor general found lobbyist registration and oversight should be strengthened through the integrity commissioner’s office, instructing the government to make changes.

That decision, however, has been punted to a committee. An update on the recommendations shared with Global News by the premier’s office suggested that a legislative committee should consider the change rather than the premier’s office or another government ministry.

Ontario NDP Leader Marit Stiles said she was skeptical the government had learned from the scandal and could avoid repeating it.

“I don’t think that under this premier and and his conservative politicians, I fear that the lessons they’ve learned is that they need to try different ways to hide what their intentions are,” she told Global News.

“I can’t believe it’s only been a year because there have been other issues,” Stiles continued. “I do think that the sort of shenanigans of the Ford government with the Greenbelt is only a part of the story.”

While the Ford government was quick to check off the list of recommendations, what it has little control over is the RCMP investigation looming over Queen’s Park.

The Ontario Provincial Police, which initially opened up a file on the Greenbelt, kicked up the investigation to the RCMP, citing a desire to avoid a perception of conflict of interest.

Since then, however, there are been few signs of progress.

The Mounties have refused to release an update on their investigation and key players in the scandal have yet to be approached by RCMP detectives.

“While the RCMP understands that this issue is of significant interest to the people of Ontario, this is an ongoing investigation, and we need to protect the integrity of our investigation,” an RCMP spokesperson told Global News. “The RCMP will not be providing any further information or updates at this time.”

What’s also unclear is the extent to which the RCMP has engaged with the government and civil service to uncover evidence related to the Greenbelt decision-making process.

Global News asked the Cabinet Office, which bridges the gap between the civil service and the political side of government, whether the Mounties had visited the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing offices or whether any information had been shared with investigators.

“Ontario public service staff cooperate with all law enforcement investigations and will continue to do so. Out of respect for the RCMP process we will not be commenting any further,” a cabinet office spokesperson told Global News in May.

Bonnie Lysyk, who handled much of the sensitive evidence related to the Greenbelt including emails and interviews, said she has not been approached by any policing agency.

Global News asked Lysyk whether the material she gathered through her legislative powers could be shared with police. She said police “usually want to go to the source of information” and suggested she would “just indicate to them” where to access it.

“They have to go reaffirm their own evidence,” Lysyk added. “So (the investigation) will be taking them back to the primary people that were involved in the process.”

Critics of the government believe the investigation will eventually lead to the premier’s office.

“I think it’s been proven that there has been a direct line from the premier’s office into the Greenbelt scandal with his benefactors, donors, rich friends,” Crombie said.

“He got caught (and) we need to know who knew what, when.”","A man stands at a podium with a microphone, speaking at a public event with a banner reading 'Building Ontario Bâtir l'Ontario' in the background.

Biden will unveil a series of new actions for the Latino community today

When President Joe Biden resumes his three-day trip to Las Vegas on Wednesday, he will talk with the nation’s largest Latino civil rights and advocacy organization, and unveil new steps on immigration and expanding access to educational opportunities.

According to a White House fact sheet shared with CNN, Biden will announce that certain undocumented children and spouses of US citizens will be able to apply for lawful permanent residency without leaving the country starting on August 19, following an executive action he signed last month.

Biden’s outreach to the Latino community is crucial, and his allies had quietly pushed for more immigration actions to benefit those who have been in the US for years to balance the administration’s aggressive border security measures, culminating in last month’s executive action.

The move was seen as a direct appeal to Latinos, some of whom live in mixed-status households, and per the White House is expected to apply to about half a million spouses of US citizens and 50,000 noncitizen children whose parent is married to a US citizen.

These are some of the other moves that are expected to be unveiled:

The Department of Education will unveil a proposed rule expanding the federal TRIO program — which provides low-income students with educational opportunities including college visits and application support — to ensure DACA recipients, or Dreamers, can enroll.

New programs to increase access to immigration services, including a DOJ program to expand volunteer legal support in immigration court hearings and a new program through DHS to increase outreach from US Citizenship and Immigration Services to local communities.

Biden will sign an Executive Order establishing a newly formed White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity through Hispanic-Serving Institutions

The president’s outreach comes as immigration has taken center stage during night two of the Republican convention in Milwaukee, a contrast the president’s campaign is eager to draw.

Takeaways from Day 2 of the Republican National Convention

On the second night of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, speakers were loyal to former President Donald Trump, describing him as a self-sacrificial leader who took America to its greatest heights, only to see Biden undo his work.

Former foes – including former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley – lined up to praise Trump, admit their errors and sell voters on the promise of a second term.

Here are five takeaways:

Haley gets on board: Haley took the stage, at Trump’s invitation, to a mix of cheers and jeers, but quickly turned the crowd around with her full endorsement of Trump.

The (other) ring kissers: Other onetime rivals, such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, also kissed Trump’s ring. They also included Vivek Ramaswamy, former Housing and Urban Development secretary Ben Carson, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.

Christie’s bombshell op-ed: Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a one-time Trump ally who has evolved to one of his most vocal Republican critics, dropped an op-ed in the New York Times just as Tuesday’s speeches got underway. Christie called Trump’s early attempts to “rein in some of the worst rhetorical impulses” in their party “less than promising.”

Candidates make their cases: Several Republican candidates in key House and Senate races made their own cases Tuesday night — with a range of approaches, from Arizona Senate candidate Keri Lake’s combative words to Pennsylvania Senate contender Dave McCormick’s call for unity.

Family programming: Lara Trump, the former president’s daughter-in-law and co-chair of the national party, closed out Tuesday’s festivities with an olive branch to fence-sitters:

JD Vance steps into the spotlight

A faint burst of applause broke out from the Republican National Convention floor as Sen. JD Vance took the stage for the first time as Donald Trump’s running mate.

The Gettysburg Address was loaded into the teleprompters, adjusted for Vance’s towering frame. Arms crossed over a navy suit and gold tie – an Ohio State man dangerously close to sporting Michigan colors – Vance looked out during his midday walkthrough, a hint of a smile on his face. Before him was an arena of empty chairs soon to be filled by members of the party he has been hand-picked to one day lead.

On Wednesday, when Vance addresses the convention, he will do so not only as the party’s vice presidential nominee but as its MAGA heir-in-waiting.

In tapping a 39-year-old first-term senator from the country’s heartland over more experienced Republicans with deeper party ties, Trump is looking ahead to the future of his political movement. Those close to Trump say he is looking to Vance to lead the party beyond his time in office, an expectation he never seriously harbored for his previous vice president, Mike Pence.

His choice of whom to carry the torch remained concealed until Trump was ready to reveal it, but the anointment of Vance shouldn’t come as a surprise. Trump’s campaign had said for months that the former president sought in a running mate “a strong leader who will make a great president for eight years after his next four-year term concludes.”

Taiwan premier responds to Trump and says ""willing to do more"" for regional stability

Taiwan’s Premier Cho Jung-tai has said the island is willing to take on more responsibility for maintaining stability in the Taiwan Strait, after former President Donald Trump said the self-governing democracy should pay the US for its defense.

“The relationship between Taiwan and the US in recent years has been very solid,” Cho said Wednesday.

Cho noted that Taiwan has steadily increased its defense spending. In 2023, its government proposed a record-high defense budget of $606.8 billion New Taiwan Dollars (approx. $20.2 billion), a 3.5% increase from the previous year.

Trump also accused Taiwan, home to the world’s biggest chipmaker, TSMC, of taking away America’s semiconductor business.

“Now we’re giving them billions of dollars to build new chips in our country, and then they’re going to take that too,” Trump said, in reference to a US government deal to give $6.6 billion to TSMC to help it build three factories in Arizona.

Some background: Taiwan produces about 90% of the most advanced semiconductor chips, which power everything from phones to artificial intelligence applications. Geopolitical tensions have pressured TSMC to expand beyond the island to diversify its production base.

When asked by CNN what he would do if Washington pressed Taiwan to move some of its chip research and development to the US, Cho said he was confident that keeping those resources on the island would be the best course of action.

Ohio Democratic lawmaker slams JD Vance as ""a disaster for women""

Democratic Ohio Rep. Shontel Brown on Tuesday slammed Republican vice presidential pick JD Vance for his vocal opposition to abortion, including past support of a federal abortion ban.

A day after Ohio voters approved a 2023 ballot measure to protect access to abortion, Vance urged Republicans to embrace a federal ban on the procedure. More recently, however, Vance has avoided taking a position when asked what national abortion standard he would support, instead nodding toward former President Donald Trump’s position that abortion policy should be determined by individual states.

Brown said Vance’s comments on abortion “just gives you a taste of what we can expect from a JD Vance vice presidency.”

Analysis: Former rivals bury criticism to celebrate Trump’s all-powerful GOP leader

Once the leader was on his throne, the ritual capitulation could begin.

Donald Trump looked on with an ethereal gaze Tuesday as a parade of Republican presidential candidates whose dreams he crushed staged a parade of the vanquished at the Republican National Convention.

On another night awash in emotion after Trump escaped an assassination attempt just days before, speakers joined a choreographed attempt to soften his hardman image, portraying him as a caring and even benevolent leader, boss and grandfather while smoothing the rougher edges of his populist and authoritarian worldview.

The message on night two in Milwaukee was double-edged and impossible to miss: this is indisputably and irrevocably Trump’s party now and the GOP is united in pursuit of victory.

“Donald Trump has my full endorsement, period,” said former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who warned during primary season that Trump would foment global and political chaos and who declared in February, “I feel no need to kiss the ring.”

Her genuflection, which came shortly after Trump made another triumphant entrance into the arena, might have come through gritted teeth, but it closed off the unfinished business of an acrimonious primary race that saw the former UN ambassador win hundreds of thousands of votes long after her campaign ended.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis once billed himself as Trumpism without the pandemonium and as a potential president who could actually enact the MAGA agenda. But on Tuesday night, he implored the crowd:

New Democratic-funded polling shows Biden losing ground to Trump in key states

CNN’s Jake Tapper has obtained polling from the firm BlueLabs — funded by some Democratic donors — that shows, post-debate, that President Joe Biden is losing ground to former President Donald Trump in 14 key states, including the five that Biden flipped against Trump in 2020: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

He is also vulnerable post-debate in Colorado, Minnesota, Maine, New Mexico, Virginia and New Hampshire.

The data also found four Democrats outpaced Biden in a matchup with Trump in battleground states: Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.

Melania Trump and family members to attend RNC on Thursday

Former President Donald Trump’s family members are expected to attend the Republican National Convention on Thursday as he accepts the GOP nomination for president, according to a source familiar with the plans.

Melania Trump, Ivanka Trump, and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner are expected to attend, the source said. Two of Trump’s sons, Don Jr. and Eric, have been present at the convention this week.

CNN previously reported that Melania Trump had maintained a low profile throughout her husband’s campaign, having attended just two public appearances since Trump launched his third presidential bid — the kickoff of his campaign in November 2022 at their Mar-a-Lago home and a brief appearance in March when she accompanied Trump to vote in the Florida presidential primary.

Key things to know about the 2nd day of the Republican National Convention

Notable past GOP critics of Donald Trump took the stage tonight in support of the party’s official nominee for president at the Republican National Convention.

His last primary rival, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, said Trump had earned her “strong endorsement” while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis praised his economic and border policies.

Trump was back in the arena, alongside his running mate Sen. JD Vance.

Meantime, Biden said he is “reluctant to walk away” from the presidential race because “there’s more to do” for the country, even as some Democrats continue a private effort to get him to step aside.

Here are some of the notable lines from the night:

Haley said Trump has her “strong endorsement, period.” She said the former president asked her to speak about unity. Haley said Americans don’t need to agree with Trump all the time to vote for him in November and argued the Republican Party needs to not just be unified, but also needs to expand.

DeSantis praised the former president on his US border and economic policies and urged Americans to stand with Trump. He said “our country was respected” when Trump was president and criticized what he called Biden’s “dereliction of duty.”

Vivek Ramaswamy, former presidential candidate, addressed “legal immigrants” and “illegal immigrants” in his speech and addressed directly to Black voters.

House Speaker Mike Johnson worked to draw an existential divide between Democrats and Republicans. He also said the House was conducting an investigation into Saturday’s assassination attempt on Trump.

Rep. Elise Stefanik, House Republican Conference Chair, stressed the importance of the election in November, saying the “soul of our very nation are on the ballot” as she attacked Biden and his administration’s policies.

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who was on Trump’s short list of vice presidential picks, said the election in November is about “putting America first.”

Lara Trump, the co-chair of the Republican National Committee and the former president’s daughter-in-law, said she changed her speech after the assassination attempt and discussed unity, before pitching the former president for another term.

What else to know:

Tomorrow: Vance will accept his nomination and address the convention on Wednesday night. His speech will focus heavily on his personal life story, a source with direct knowledge of his remarks tells CNN. The undercurrents already percolating regarding Vance being viewed as the torchbearer for the MAGA movement.

Later this week: Trump is expected to speak on Thursday and accept his nomination. Donald Trump. Jr said his father has “toned down” the remarks after an assassination attempt over the weekend. Trump and Vance will also hold a rally in Michigan, a battleground state, on Saturday.

Supreme Court reforms: Biden is seriously considering publicly endorsing major reforms at the top court, according to two sources familiar with the deliberations. Chief among the changes Biden is planning to publicly back are term limits for the nine justices and an ethics code for the court that would contain an enforcement mechanism.

Biden nomination push: More House Democrats are calling on the Democratic National Committee to ditch plans to virtually nominate Biden in the coming weeks. Democrats have been planning for weeks to conclude Biden’s nomination process before August 7 – well ahead of the convention next month. CNN has also learned from multiple sources of a draft letter calling on the party to slow down the process – a clear sign of the party’s deep worries about Biden.

Outside the convention: Law enforcement in Milwaukee arrested a 21-year-old man Monday afternoon who was seen carrying a weapon and wearing a ski mask blocks away from the convention, the Milwaukee Police Department said. Earlier in the day, police fatally shot a man about a mile away from the venue, CNN affiliate WISN reported. Witnesses told the station that two men were fighting in a local park when one of them pulled a knife out. Officers responded and multiple officers shot the man with the knife, WISN reported, noting police had not confirmed those details.

Fact Check: Lara Trump’s claims about unemployment records under Donald Trump

Lara Trump, the co-chair of the Republican National Committee and the former president’s daughter-in-law, hailed the state of the country during the Trump administration. Among other things, she said there were “record low unemployment rates for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans and women.”

Facts First: These claims need context. Lara Trump didn’t mention that the Donald Trump-era record lows for African American unemployment, Hispanic American unemployment and women’s unemployment were all beaten or matched during President Joe Biden’s presidency, though the Trump-era record for Asian American unemployment still stands.

The current record low for the Black or African American unemployment rate, 4.8%, was set under Biden in April 2023. That beat the Trump-era low that was a record at the time, 5.3% in August 2019 and September 2019. (A cautionary note: This official data series goes back only to 1972.)

The Hispanic or Latino unemployment rate hit 3.9% under Biden in September 2022, tying the record low first set in 2019 under Trump.

The unemployment rate among women hit 3.4% under Trump in September 2019 and October 2019, the lowest since the 1950s, but it fell to 3.3% under Biden in January 2023.

The record set under Trump for Asian American unemployment, 2% in June 2019, has not been matched under Biden. The lowest Biden-era rate was 2.3% in July 2023.

Vance's speech on Wednesday will focus heavily on his life story

JD Vance’s speech on Wednesday night — which is being referred to by the Trump campaign as “the VP’s night” — is expected to focus heavily on his personal life story, a source with direct knowledge of his remarks tells CNN.

Vance will describe how he came “from nothing,” the source said, and highlight his journey from an unstable childhood with a family that struggled with opioid addiction in rural Ohio, to a Yale law school graduate, marine, venture capitalist, best-selling author, and ultimately becoming Donald Trump’s vice presidential nominee after just a year-and-a-half in the Senate.

One thing to watch: The undercurrents already percolating regarding Vance being viewed as the torch bearer for the MAGA movement.

Trump’s senior advisers told CNN the former president wanted to select a running mate that would help keep the party united around the Trump agenda.

Lara Trump says she changed her RNC speech after assassination attempt

Lara Trump, the co-chair of the Republican National Committee and the former president’s daughter-in-law, said she changed her speech after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump and discussed unity, before pitching the former president for another term.

Trump thanked supporters at the convention and those watching around the world and sent her condolences to Corey Comperatore, who was fatally shot during the incident.

“If Donald Trump has shown us anything it’s that when it feels impossible to keep going, those are the times we must keep going,” she said.

The assassination attempt was a “jarring reminder” that “there is more that unites us than divides us,” Lara Trump said.

Lara Trump was elected as co-chair in early March as part of Donald Trump’s takeover of the GOP.

Lara Trump and new chair Michael Whatley succeeded Drew McKissick and Ronna McDaniel, who had earned the ire of the former president because of his dissatisfaction with how the RNC handled claims of fraud around the 2020 election, CNN previously reported.

Standing ovation for Southern California mother whose son died of fentanyl overdose

Southern California mother Anne Fundner received a standing ovation during her Republican National Convention speech as she recounted her 15-year-old son’s overdose death in 2022, which she described as the “tragic reality of open borders.”

Fundner, who introduced herself as a wife and mother of four, described her oldest son, Weston, as an “amazing big brother” who regularly attended church and loved to play football and surf.

The mother fought back tears as the audience, including former president Donald Trump and his vice-presidential pick, Sen. JD Vance, stood in a standing ovation and chanted Weston’s name and yelled “Joe must go!”

“I hold Joe Biden, Kamala Harris — the border czar, what a joke — and Gavin Newsom and every Democrat who supports open borders responsible for the death of my son.”

Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders says ""God is not finished with President Trump""

Arkansas’s Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders was met with a standing ovation during her Republican National Convention speech where she said God is “not finished with President (Donald) Trump.”

She looked to humanize Trump, drawing on her time working in the White House. Sanders recalled one time during a bring-your-child-to-work day, her son, Huck, seemed to be running straight toward the former president’s waiting for a hug. But, she said, Huck “sidesteps the president, completely ignoring him in front of everyone and ran straight into my arms.”

“Because he’s the amazing man he is, president Trump didn’t mind at all. After all. He’s a dad to five unbelievable kids and a grandfather to 10. And while that story is certainly a special memory for my family, it’s an even greater reminder why I support President Trump: not for me, not for him, but for my kids and for yours,” she added.

Sanders also remembered a time she was being criticized by members of the media, saying, “Our president pulled me aside, looked me in the eye and said, ‘Sarah, you’re smart. You’re beautiful, you’re tough and they attack you because you’re good at your job. Never let them stop fighting.’”

“Thank you, Mr. President. That’s the Donald Trump that I know.”

Fact Check: House Speaker Mike Johnson makes false claim about crime under Biden

After criticizing President Joe Biden as weak, House Speaker Mike Johnson claimed in his Tuesday speech at the Republican National Convention that Democrats’ policies have brought communities “dramatic increases” in “violence, crime and drugs.”

Similarly, House Republican Conference Chair Rep. Elise Stefanik referred to “Biden’s violent crime crisis,” and a video played near the beginning of the Tuesday evening proceedings featured a narrator saying, “It’s not just big cities. Rising crime is a problem everywhere.”

Facts First: Johnson’s claims about dramatic increases in violence and crime are false, as is the convention video’s claim that there is a problem “everywhere” with “rising crime.” Official data published by the FBI shows violent crime dropped significantly in the US in 2023 and in the first quarter of 2024, though there were increases in some communities; violent crime is now lower than it was in 2020, President Donald Trump’s last calendar year in office.

Stefanik’s claim of a “violent crime crisis” under Biden is subjective, but she certainly did not acknowledge that the current numbers under Biden are superior to final Trump-era numbers.

Preliminary FBI data for 2023 showed a roughly 13% national decline in murder and a roughly 6% national decline in overall violent crime compared to 2022, bringing both murder and violent crime levels below where they were in 2020. And preliminary FBI data for the first quarter of 2024 showed an even steeper drop from the same quarter in 2023 – a roughly 26% decline in murder and roughly 15% decline in overall violent crime.

There are limitations to the FBI-published data, which comes from local law enforcement – the numbers are preliminary, not all communities submitted data, and the submitted data usually has some initial errors – so these statistics may not precisely capture the size of the recent declines in crime. But these statistics and other data sources make it clear crime has indeed declined to some extent nationally, though not everywhere.

Crime data expert Jeff Asher, co-founder of the firm AH Datalytics, said that if the final 2023 figures show a decline in murder of at least 10% from 2022, this would be the fastest US decline “ever recorded.” And he noted that both the preliminary FBI-published data from the first quarter of 2024 and also “crime data collected from several independent sources point to an even larger decline in property and violent crime, including a substantially larger drop in murder, so far this year compared to 2023, though there is still time left in the year for those trends to change.”

Analysis: First poll since Saturday’s attack shows little change in Trump-Biden race

Saturday’s assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump may upend the presidential race. Such a shift, however, is not seen in the first survey taken since the shooting in Pennsylvania.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll of registered voters released Tuesday puts Trump at 43% to President Joe Biden’s 41%, well within the survey’s margin of error. Their previous poll had the race tied at 40%. A Reuters/Ipsos poll in early June gave Trump 41% to Biden’s 39%, again within the margin of error.

This isn’t to say that later surveys won’t show Trump moving up. In fact, it would be at least a little surprising if Trump doesn’t rise in the polls in the upcoming days given that presidential candidates usually receive a polling bump after their party conventions.

Still, this is a race that hasn’t shown a lot of movement nationally over the course of the campaign. After Biden’s weak debate performance in late June, polls showed only a minimal movement away from him.

The 2024 race has, in fact, been statistically the most stable on record. Fortunately for Trump, this has meant that he’s had a narrow but consistent advantage.

DeSantis praises Trump for border and economic policies

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis praised Donald Trump on his US border and economic policies during a speech at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.

DeSantis, who ran against Trump to be the GOP candidate for president, went on to criticize what he called President Joe Biden’s “dereliction of duty.”

“As a citizen, as a husband and as a father, I am alarmed that the current president of the United States lacks the capability to discharge the duties of his office,” DeSantis said.

This post has been updated with additional comments from DeSantis.

The Republican Party needs to expand, Nikki Haley says at RNC

Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who was Donald Trump’s top 2024 GOP primary rival, said the Republican Party needs to not just be unified, but also needs to expand.

She argued the party needs to be strong “to save America” and called this a “defining moment” for both the party and the country.

“In this moment we have a chance to put aside our differences and focus on what unites us and strengthens our country,” Haley said.

Haley blames Obama and Biden for Putin actions in Ukraine

Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley highlighted Russia’s invasion of Crimea under then-President Barack Obama in 2014 and then Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 under President Joe Biden.

“But when Donald Trump was president, Putin did nothing … no invasions, no wars. That was no accident. Putin didn’t attack Ukraine because he knew Donald Trump was tough,” she said.

Remember: Trump has said he would pressure Ukraine into a peace deal with Russia that would see Kyiv cede territory in the process if he wins the presidency. Earlier this year, Trump said he would allow Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” with countries that don’t meet NATO defense-funding obligations. As president, Trump described NATO as “obsolete,” and he has aligned himself with Putin, who wants to weaken the alliance. The former president has long praised Putin and went as far as to side with the Russian leader over the US intelligence community regarding Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Haley also slammed Biden’s record on Afghanistan and called it his “sign of weakness” that Israeli Americans are still being held in Gaza.

Nikki Haley: ""Donald Trump has my strong endorsement, period""

Nikki Haley, the former ambassador to the United Nations and a former Republican presidential primary challenger, said she came to the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee to speak about unity.

Haley called it a “gracious invitation” and said she was happy to accept. “Donald Trump has my strong endorsement, period,” Haley said.

Haley was invited to the convention just days ago. Last week, Haley spokesperson Chaney Denton told CNN that she was not invited and that she was “fine with that.”

The former governor said tonight that the country will be “badly worse off” with four more years of the Biden administration. Haley also argued that Democrats have moved too far to the left. “For the sake of our nation, we have to go with Donald Trump,” she said.

Haley acknowledged that not all Americans agree with Trump all of the time. She said in her remarks that she was speaking directly to those voters.

Haley was the last Trump opponent to stay in the GOP presidential race and argued she would be a better standard-bearer for the Republican Party to reel in moderate and independent voters in a general election against Biden.

Haley, who served as Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, said on the trail that she feels “no need to kiss the ring.” Even after suspending her campaign, she didn’t immediately endorse the former president and instead urged him to “earn” the support of voters who backed her. But she ultimately said last month that she’d be voting for her former boss and released her delegates to the convention and encouraging them to support Trump.

This post has been updated with more of Haley’s comments.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz thanks God for protecting Trump and warns that US southern border is facing ""an invasion""

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz opened his speech at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, by “giving thanks to God Almighty for protecting President Trump” at Saturday’s rally in Pennsylvania, where he survived an assassination attempt.

He then moved on to underlining the stakes of the November election, warning that America is facing “an invasion” on its southern border.

Cruz said that when Trump is elected, “we will fix this.”

Remember: The former president has made immigration and the border a central campaign issue, successfully pressuring Republicans to reject a major bipartisan border deal earlier this year.

Fact check: Trump also has often spoken about the United States being “overrun” by a “new form” of crime he called “Biden migrant crime.” He made that claim earlier this year though early data suggests that in 2023 the US was at or around its lowest violent crime rate in more than 50 years amid a sharp decline in homicides; though there were cases of undocumented people committing crimes during his own presidency; and though, despite some recent cases in which undocumented people are accused of serious offenses, research has found no connection between immigration and crime – and sometimes that immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than people born in the US.

This post has been updated with Cruz’s remarks and with a recent CNN fact check on claims about crimes committed by undocumented people.

Fact Check: House Majority Leader Steve Scalise on migrants coming to the US

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said Tuesday in his Republican National Convention speech that migrants are arriving in the US after having been deliberately freed from prison.

“On the border, Biden and Harris opened it up to the entire world. Prisons are being emptied,” said Scalise, a Louisiana Republican.

Facts first: There is no evidence for Scalise’s claim that “prisons are being emptied” so that prisoners can travel to the US as migrants.

“I do a daily news search to see what’s going on in prisons around the world and have seen absolutely no evidence that any country is emptying its prisons and sending them all to the US,” said Helen Fair, who is co-author of the World Prison Population List, which tracks the global prison population, and a research fellow at the Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research at Birkbeck, University of London.

Former President Donald Trump, now the Republican presidential nominee, has repeatedly made such claims in his own speeches and interviews. But Trump has never provided any proof for the claim.

Trump’s campaign has provided CNN with only a vague 2022 article from right-wing website Breitbart about a supposed federal intelligence report warning Border Patrol agents about Venezuela freeing violent prisoners who had then joined migrant caravans.

But this supposed claim about Venezuela’s actions has never been corroborated, and experts have told CNN, PolitiFact and FactCheck.org that they know of no proof of any such thing having happened.

The recorded global prison population increased from October 2021 to April 2024, from about 10.77 million people to about 10.99 million people, according to the World Prison Population List.

Trump returns to RNC arena to watch former primary rivals

Former President Donald Trump, still wearing a bandage over his right ear, is at the Republican National Convention arena in Milwaukee for a second night.

His running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, entered the convention earlier this evening.

They are both together in the box, alongside GOP Reps. Elise Stefanik, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Trump’s son Eric Trump and Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, among others.

Trump’s former primary rivals Nikki Haley and Gov. Ron DeSantis are set to take the stage soon to deliver remarks.

The post was updated with more details on Trump’s arrival.

Analysis: Immigration takes on added importance to voters

One of the main themes of the Republican National Convention’s second night is the border. That isn’t too surprising given that Donald Trump has always been quite hawkish on immigration.

But Trump and the Republicans are presenting their message to a more receptive national audience.

More Americans (22%) rank immigration as the nation’s top problem than any other issue, according to a June Gallup poll. Four years ago, just 2% put immigration as the nation’s most important problem — it was tied as the 15th most important problem.

But it’s not just that immigration is now top of mind for more Americans. It’s that more Americans now trust Trump on the issue than they did in 2020.

When asked which candidate was better on immigration and border security, Trump topped Joe Biden by 27 points in a May Marquette University Law School survey. A similar June 2020 question from a CNBC survey found Biden up by a point over Trump (well within the margin of error).

It’s no wonder then that the word “border” was mentioned 27 times in this year’s Republican Party platform. In 2016 (the last year with a full GOP platform), the word border was mentioned 17 times. The increase comes despite the fact that this year’s platform had fewer words than the one eight years ago.

Similarly, the word “invasion” appears six times in the 2024 platform, up from zero mentions in 2016.

JD Vance returns to RNC arena, a day after becoming Trump's VP pick

JD Vance is at the Republican National Convention arena in Milwaukee tonight.

On Monday, the Ohio senator was formally nominated as former President Donald Trump’s GOP vice presidential candidate.

He is in box tonight with GOP Reps. Elise Stefanik and Marjorie Taylor Greene. Trump’s son Eric Trump and Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders are also present in the box.

Trump is also expected to attend the convention tonight.

JD Vance says Harris was ""very gracious, very cordial"" on phone call

Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance confirmed he connected with Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday, after initially ignoring the call from an unknown number.

“Obviously, we’re going to do everything that we can to persuade the American people to vote for the President Trump, Vice President Vance ticket, but I appreciated the call. It was very kind of her,” he added.

Vance was asked if he saved the number.

“I did not. I did not,” he said, laughing.

“Democrats are actively trying to throw their nominee under the bus. This party out here is really united behind President Trump. It’s a really good feeling and I think that momentum is something you can almost reach out and touch,” Vance said.

Vance also said “it’s totally crazy” that the first Republican National Convention he’s ever attended is where he was nominated as vice president.

Trump accuses Democrats of attacking Supreme Court as Biden considers pushing for major reforms

Former President Donald Trump accused Democrats of attacking the Supreme Court as President Joe Biden seriously considers publicly endorsing major reforms at the nation’s highest court.

“The Radical Left Democrats are desperately trying to “Play the Ref” by calling for an illegal and unConstitutional attack on our SACRED United States Supreme Court,” Trump posted on Truth Social.

CNN reported that Biden is seriously considering publicly endorsing major reforms at the top court, a move that would make him the first sitting president in generations to back seismic changes to the way the nation’s highest court operates, according to two sources familiar with the deliberations.

Chief among the changes Biden is planning to publicly back are term limits for the nine justices, who currently serve lifetime appointments. The president is also said to be preparing to throw his support behind an ethics code for the court that would contain an enforcement mechanism, which was notably absent from the code the court adopted last year.

Fact Check: Rep. Elise Stefanik claims Biden presidency led to the highest inflation of her lifetime

Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York claimed in her Republican National Convention speech Tuesday that President Joe Biden’s presidency has led to the “highest rate of inflation” in her lifetime.

Facts First: This claim is out of date.

While the year-over-year inflation rate in June 2022, about 9.1%, was the highest since late 1981, inflation has declined sharply since that Biden-era peak, and the most recent available rate, for June 2024, was about 3%. That rate was exceeded as recently as 2011. Stefanik was born in 1984.

Fact Check: Wisconsin Senate candidate exaggerates the numbers of fentanyl deaths

Eric Hovde, the Republican running for Senate in Wisconsin, claimed in his RNC speech Tuesday that the Biden administration “emboldened drug cartels to flood our streets with fentanyl killing over 100,000 Americans every year” by opening the country’s southern border and allowing “criminals and terrorists to enter the country.”

Facts First: It’s a significant exaggeration that fentanyl kills more than 100,000 Americans every year due to the country’s “open” borders. The number of overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids in 2023, including fentanyl, was approximately 75,000, according to estimated and provisional data.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in May that roughly 107,500 people in the US died from a drug overdose, but that is the total number of people who died from an overdose from any kind of drug.

Synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, were involved in the majority of those fatalities, making up nearly 70% of overdose deaths in 2023, but they did not account for all of them.

In fact, compared with 2022, there were around 1,500 fewer overdose deaths involving fentanyl and other synthetic opioids in 2023. The estimated number of deaths involving cocaine and psychostimulants such as methamphetamines increased in 2023.

Specifically, in 2023, there were 74,702 deaths from synthetic opioids, and most of those deaths were from fentanyl. By comparison, in 2022 the estimated number was 76,226, according to the CDC.

It is also worth noting that fentanyl is largely smuggled by US citizens through legal ports of entry, rather than by migrants sneaking into the country. Contrary to frequent claims by Republicans, the border is not “open;” border officers have seized an increasing amount of illicit fentanyl, numbering in the hundreds of millions of pills, under Biden.

Vivek Ramaswamy addresses ""legal"" and ""illegal"" immigrants in his RNC speech

Former Presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, a staunch supporter of Donald Trump, addressed “legal immigrants” and “illegal immigrants” in his Tuesday address at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

To “legal immigrants,” he said: “You’re like my parents. You deserve the opportunity to secure a better life for your children in America.”

To “illegal immigrants,” he said: “We will return you to your country of origin, not because you’re all bad people, but because you broke the law. And the United States of America was founded on the rule of law.”

Vivek Ramaswamy: We want for Black communities ""what we want for every American""

Former Presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, a staunch supporter of Donald Trump, used his Tuesday address at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to speak to Black Americans watching at home.

The Republican Party cares about Black communities, he said.

Biden stops by local Las Vegas grocery that benefited from American Rescue Plan funding

President Joe Biden arrived at Mario’s Westside Market Tuesday evening where he stopped by the checkout register to greet some attendants, posing for pictures with a few of them.

“Is that my good side?” one person asked, prompting Biden to joke, “I don’t have a good side.”

Biden then moved back to the deli counter, where he was greeted by the Mario of Mario’s Westside Market.

Mario detailed the funding he’d received under the American Rescue Plan, which allowed him to expand the products his store offers.

Vivek Ramaswamy jokes in his RNC speech that most people ""know how to say my name by now""

Former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, and a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, opened his speech at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with a joke.

To be American in the year 2024 means to “believe in the ideals of 1776,” Ramaswamy said.

“It means we believe in merit, that you get ahead in this country not on the color of your skin, but on the content of your character and your contributions. It means we believe in the rule of law. And I say this as the kid of legal immigrants to this country that means your first act of entering this country cannot break the law. That is why we will seal the southern border on day 1,” he said.

The post was updated with more of Ramaswamy’s remarks.

House Speaker Mike Johnson says ""we're uniting today as Americans"" in wake of Trump attempted assassination

House Speaker Mike Johnson delivered remarks at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, saying the country is uniting at this moment.

He assured the audience that the House was conducting an investigation into Saturday’s events, “the American people deserve to know the truth and we will ensure accountability.”

CNN previously reported that the House Oversight Committee had scheduled a briefing with committee members and the Secret Service Tuesday, but the Department of Homeland Security intervened and “refused to confirm a briefing time.” A spokesperson for the panel also said the committee plans to subpoena testimony of Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle.

The Louisiana Republican throughout the rest of his speech looked to draw an existential divide between Democrats and Republicans.

“We are no longer just in a battle between two opposing political parties,” he said, adding later, “We’re now in the midst of a struggle between two completely different visions of who we are as Americans and what our country will be.”

He said the progressive left “have a very different vision for what America should become. They want to tear down those foundations and remold us into some sort of borderless, lawless, marxist, socialist utopia. We’re here to say, not on our watch, we will not allow that to happen.”

Johnson said he only recently dropped his son off to begin school at the Naval Academy, who will, when he graduates, “join the 1.3 million active duty service members who bravely defend our country.”

“We’re so proud of Jack and all our children. But like most parents today, we’re concerned about their future. America can’t risk four more years of Joe Biden’s weakness that has invited so much aggression by our enemies,” Johnson said.

This post has been updated with Johnson’s remarks.

Rupert Murdoch attends RNC

Rupert Murdoch, the right-wing media mogul who controls Fox News, is attending the Republican National Convention, a person familiar with the matter told CNN.

Murdoch arrived in Milwaukee on Tuesday, the person added.

Murdoch has a long, complicated history with Trump. The former president, upset that Fox News has not in his view been sufficiently loyal to him, has at times bashed Murdoch in no-holds-barred terms.

Murdoch’s visit to the RNC also comes after he advocated for North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum to be selected as vice president, including as recently as last week, according to a second person familiar with the matter. Trump, however, selected JD Vance, announcing him as his pick on Monday.

Fact Check: Kari Lake's claims on her opponent’s record about voting laws

Kari Lake said Tuesday that Democratic Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego, her likely opponent in the state’s US Senate race this fall, voted last week to let undocumented immigrants “illegally cast a ballot in this upcoming election.”

Fact First: This claim is false.

The House did not vote on whether to allow noncitizens to vote. The chamber passed a bill on July 10 that would require documentary proof of US citizenship to register to vote in federal elections. Gallego voted against the legislation, which is not expected to be taken up by the Democratic-controlled Senate.

It is already illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections, and experts say it rarely occurs. When people register to vote, they must provide a driver’s license or Social Security number, and their identity is checked against existing databases. Voters are required to swear under penalty of perjury that they are a US citizen. Noncitizens who vote illegally can face imprisonment or deportation.

Gallego said in a statement that he opposed the bill because its “only purpose is to disenfranchise tens of thousands of Arizonans, and I will not vote to take away the rights of Arizonans to stop something that is already illegal.”

“Of course, only U.S. citizens should vote,” said Gallego. “But this bill isn’t about that, it’s about making it harder for Arizonans to vote, including married women, servicemembers, Native Arizonans, seniors, and people with disabilities.”

CNN’s Clare Foran and Haley Talbot contributed reporting to this post.

Biden says he is ""reluctant to walk away"" from race because ""there’s more to do"" for the country

As the Republican National Convention is underway, President Joe Biden said he is “reluctant to walk away” from the presidential race because “there’s more to do” for the country, even as some Democrats continue a private effort to get him to step aside.

Asked if there is anything, including family members, that would convince him to rethink staying in the race, Biden replied, “If I had some medical condition that emerged, if somebody – if the doctors came and said you’ve got this problem, you’ve got that problem.”

Biden defended his decision to not be a transitional candidate, something he originally committed to during last cycle’s election.

“When I originally ran, you may remember it, I said I was going to be a transitional candidate. And I thought that I’d be able to move from this to pass it on to someone else. But I didn’t anticipate things getting so, so, so divided,” he told Gordon.

When asked about reproductive rights and the Supreme Court, Biden warned about what he believes a future Trump presidency would mean in terms of future appointments to the bench: “There’s probably gonna be two more appointments to the court. There’s probably two people who are going to resign – uh resign, retire. Just imagine – if he has two more appointments on that, what that means forever.”

With his well-known pup, Babydog, by his side, West Virginia's governor praises Trump

West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice praised former President Donald Trump at the Republican National Convention on Tuesday with his well-known pup by his side.

Justice’s bulldog, Babydog, sat in a chair next to the governor while he gave remarks to the convention crowd.

Justice is running for Senate to fill Joe Manchin’s seat. He has switched party affiliations a few times. He was an independent and a Republican up until 2015. He ran for governor as a Democrat. But in 2017, a year into Trump’s presidency, he announced he would change his registration to Republican at a rally with Trump.

The governor called Trump “super smart” and a “business guy” and talked about how he has spent time with Trump’s sons.

At the end of his remarks, Justice said Babydog predicts Republicans will retain the House majority and flip the Senate and “overwhelmingly we’re going to elect Donald J. Trump and JD Vance in November.”

Trump met with Boris Johnson at RNC

Former President Donald Trump met with former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the GOP convention in Milwaukee.

Trump posted a photo of their meeting on Truth Social and said, “Nice meeting with Former Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, a very fine guy!”

The two leaders have long been linked together, with Johnson having been previously known as “Britain Trump.” Trump and Johnson’s tenures briefly lined up when the Conservative Party emerged triumphant from the carnage of Brexit under Johnson’s charismatic leadership in 2019. He was forced to resign, though, in 2022 after a turbulent term as prime minister. Conservatives have since fallen from grace, with Labor Party winning an election earlier this month in a landslide victory.

Trump and Vance slated to appear together every night of RNC, according to source

Former President Donald Trump and his newly minted vice presidential pick Sen. JD Vance are slated to appear together every night at the Republican National Convention, a source familiar with their plans tells CNN.

In addition to an expected appearance Tuesday night, Vance will make his first formal speech as Trump’s running mate to the convention on Wednesday, the day before Trump is slated to speak.

Trump selected the Ohio senator on the first day of the RNC, just two days after he survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, over the weekend. The former president stole the show Monday night when he made his first public appearance since the shooting and joined Vance for Monday night’s final speeches.

Trump shares discredited vaccine skepticism on call with RFK Jr. in since-deleted video

Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s son, Bobby Kennedy III, posted a video of a phone call between Kennedy Jr. and former President Donald Trump in which Trump appeared to endorse false theories about vaccines’ safety.

Kennedy III posted the brief video on social media Tuesday morning, filming Kennedy Jr. as he listens to Trump speak on the phone. Kennedy III said the video was taken on Sunday, the day after Trump was injured in an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.

Kennedy III has deleted the post containing the video.

In the video, Trump can be heard discussing the amount of doses of vaccines that are scheduled for children and suggested that after taking a high volume of vaccines, babies start to change.

Trump also appeared to express some skepticism toward public health professionals who accurately state the recommended immunization schedule for children is safe and effective, saying, “And then you hear it doesn’t have an impact, right?”

Kennedy Jr. apologized to Trump for the video of the phone call being released after his son took it down. Trump and Kennedy met in-person in Milwaukee on Monday.

False claims: As a candidate, Kennedy Jr. has repeatedly made false claims about the safety and efficacy of vaccines. He’s regularly criticized Trump for approving public health restrictions during the Covid-19 health pandemic and implementing a plan to accelerate the development of a Covid vaccine.

Biden campaign responds: President Joe Biden’s campaign said in a statement Tuesday: “Trump and his anti-vax bud ‘Bobby’ are spreading dangerous conspiracy theories that threaten the lifesaving care that tens of millions of people depend on.”

“This leaked footage is further proof Trump can’t be trusted to protect Americans’ health care. It’s frightening, and if he gains power, it could be the devastating reality for working families across the country,” the statement said.

CNN has reached out to the Kennedy campaign and the Trump campaign for comment.

This post has been updated with comments from Biden’s campaign.

Analysis: 2 takeaways have become clear so far during the RNC

Political parties are amorphous and only exist as the sum of many thousands of parts from elites and lawmakers at the top and down to individual states, districts and precincts — and ultimately, the votes of partisans who show up to vote in primaries.

It’s rare that parties gather in one place — so quadrennial nominating conventions offer a valuable chance to take the temperature of the two great forces in American politics. This year is especially important because the Covid-19 pandemic shut down the traditional conventions four years ago.

There are two key takeaways so far from RNC 2024:

This is Trump’s party. There is no speaker, theme or attendee that doesn’t reflect what he wants. His escape from an assassination attempt has only underscored his dominance of the GOP. This distinguishes this convention from many previous versions in both parties which projected unity but suffered from dissent simmering below the surface as factions fought for influence. Anyone not on the Trump train has stayed away. Even Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell cast Kentucky’s delegate votes for an antagonist who used to refer to him as “old crow.” In a rare moment of discord here, he was drowned out by boos.

Republican convention-goers are happy, united, all heading in the same direction and are convinced they are going to win. This should really worry Democrats — who can’t even decide who their nominee should be a month before their convention following President Joe Biden’s recent struggles. Divided parties rarely do well in critical elections.

Elon Musk is going all-in on Donald Trump

Elon Musk is now publicly endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential reelection bid.

The Tesla CEO is planning on supporting Trump’s presidential campaign by committing $45 million a month to a new super PAC backing the former president, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The donations, if they come to pass, are a significant development in not only the campaign, but also the relationship between the two men, who both have fervent support among millions of fans who stand ready to believe most anything they say.

Musk has given money to candidates from both parties in the past. He used to be primarily a Democratic donor, but those relatively paltry sums pale in comparison to the amount he is now reportedly donating to Trump.

Musk has said for several years the Democratic Party has moved too far to the left for him to support many of its candidates.

Asked at a recent shareholder meeting about his relationship with Trump, and Trump having nice things to say about Tesla even as he attacks electric vehicles, Musk replied, “I can be persuasive.”

Relations haven’t always been so friendly between the two. Musk quit two White House business councils he served on early in 2017 after Trump announced America would withdraw from Paris climate accord, tweeting at the time that “climate change is real.”

Convicted Trump aide Peter Navarro will fly to Milwaukee for RNC after prison release Wednesday

Peter Navarro – the former Trump White House adviser who has been in prison since March for defying a subpoena from the January 6 congressional committee – will fly to the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Wednesday after his release from prison.

Navarro’s fiancé is planning to pick him up on Wednesday morning as he finishes his four-month sentence at the federal prison camp in Miami, and then drive him to Miami Executive Airport, where a private plane provided by his book publisher will be waiting, Navarro’s prison consultant Sam Mangel told CNN.

Haley will address uncertain voters about why she is voting for Trump

Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in her speech to the Republican National Convention Tuesday night will “address voters who are uncertain about voting for President Trump and make the case for why she is voting for him,” a source with knowledge of her remarks tells CNN.

Trump’s former primary rival made clear in May that she would vote for him. Haley announced last week that she was releasing her delegates to the convention and encouraging them to support Trump.

RFK Jr. gains ballot access in North Carolina

North Carolina’s elections board has granted ballot access to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. while denying Cornel West in a hearing on Tuesday, settling key questions around November’s ballot in a key battleground state.

The North Carolina State Board of Elections voted on the validity of both candidates petitions after holding hearings about objections that were raised questioning their compliance with state law. The hearings have garnered significant attention.

The objections at the heart of the board’s decision came from Clear Choice PAC, a pro-Biden super PAC working to combat third-party candidates, who alleged the minor parties formed by Kennedy and West did not comply with North Carolina state laws and suggested both campaigns misled voters to collect signatures.

Democrat Siobhan O’Duffy Millen, the sole board member who voted to deny both Kennedy and West ballot access, argued their efforts to gain ballot access in other states as an independent or in affiliation with other minor parties show that they are attempting to circumvent state laws governing ballot access for independent candidates.

In North Carolina, independent presidential candidates were required to submit 83,188 signatures before April 8th to qualify. But presidential candidates nominated by minor parties only had to submit 13,865 signatures and had until May 17th to do so.

Board chair Alan Hirsch, also a Democrat, said he agreed with Millen’s argument that Kennedy’s campaign is committing “subterfuge” by establishing its minor party, but voted to approve Kennedy’s petition anyway. He said it was “a close call” and suggested any appeal to a judge would “have a good case.”

In a statement to CNN, Clear Choice PAC founder Pete Kavanaugh condemned the board’s decision to approved Kennedy’s petition.

Analysis: Trump looked emotional at the RNC. How will he use his second chance at politics and life?

A close call with death often changes people — but not always in predictable ways.

Even Donald Trump — who’s spent decades crafting his image as a strongman who is not hostage to the vulnerabilities of other mortals — may not be immune an epiphany about life’s fragility.

There did seem something different about the former president on Monday night during his triumphant reemergence at the Republican National Convention. Normally, his body language is cocky, bombastic and designed to intimidate. When he walked into the convention hall, with a bandage on his ear, his face wore unfamiliar emotions. He seemed moved and, for once, aware of something other than himself. At times, his eyes looked like they were brimming with tears.

But no one can really tell what is going on in Trump’s head or how he will respond. He’s pledged to bring the country together and that everything has changed. But his pick for vice presidential nominee, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who is known for incendiary rhetoric and who modeled himself on Trump’s politics of division, undercut such a message.

Trump has two pathways ahead of him. Given that he’s ahead in the polls, the country wants stability and President Joe Biden is very unpopular, it would be politically smart to modulate his approach and cruise to Election Day. But this is not who Trump has ever been. His entire political persona is rooted in crushing opponents, wielding unaccountable power, creating his own version of false reality and often, even public cruelty. This is what made him so popular among his most devoted supporters.

But Trump has a second chance at politics and life, and it will be interesting to see how he uses it.

Here's who is expected to speak this week at the Republican National Convention

The Republican National Convention has a range of speakers lined up for its convention this week, including lawmakers, governors, and celebrities such as Dana White from the UFC, former President Donald Trump’s campaign.

Republicans are gathering in Milwaukee, where they officially anointed Trump as their presidential nominee and his VP pick, JD Vance.

CNN reported earlier that former Fox News host Tucker Carlson and former Trump aide Peter Navarro, who is expected to be released from prison, would also speak at the convention.

From Trump’s family, sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump; Lara Trump, Eric Trump’s wife and the co-chair of the RNC; and Kimberly Guilfoyle, Donald Trump Jr.’s fiancee and former Fox News host, will speak.

Here is the full list of expected speakers.

Ohio Democrat backs away from talk of Biden stepping down

The assassination attempt on Donald Trump “overtook” conversations about whether President Joe Biden should drop out of the presidential race, Democratic Rep. Greg Landsman of Ohio said on CNN Tuesday.

Landsman, whose seat is described as “competitive” by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, suggested last week that he was getting “closer and closer” to joining Democrats who have publicly called on Biden to step aside in the wake of his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump last month.

That was before the attempt on Trump’s life scrambled the presidential race, however.

On “CNN This Morning” Tuesday, Kasie Hunt asked Landsman, “Are you ready to tell President Biden that you think he should step aside?”

“No. First and foremost, what we all witnessed on Saturday was this, an attempted assassination on … former President Trump’s life,” Landsman responded. “That overtook, as you can imagine, the conversations that I was having at home.”

Landsman said he conveyed his concerns to leadership and will leave the decision up to them and Biden.

In his comments last week, Landsman said he wanted to speak with his constituents in Ohio before making a decision about the president’s political future.

Speaking with Hunt, Landsman also took issue with Trump’s vice presidential pick JD Vance, criticizing Vance’s “incendiary” language and stating that it runs contrary to the unity message Trump is trying to convey.

Harris and Vance have yet to speak but are trying to find time today, according to source

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump’s new running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, have yet to speak as of this morning, but their teams are trying to find a time to connect today, a source familiar with the matter says.

CNN previously reported Harris left a voicemail for Vance shortly after Trump announced the Ohio senator as his vice presidential pick on Monday. Vance didn’t answer Harris’ phone call because it came from an unknown number, and he was unable to call back. Staff for Vance’s team has since been in touch with Harris’ team to work on setting up a call.

Former Pence adviser to appear with Harris Wednesday, source says

Olivia Troye, an ex-adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence who became a fierce Donald Trump critic, is scheduled to appear with Vice President Kamala Harris at a campaign event Wednesday, a source familiar with the appearance said.

Troye is one of a number of high-profile Republicans to back President Joe Biden in recent weeks. Former Rep. Adam Kinzinger and former Georgia Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan have also announced their support for the president.

Key things to know about JD Vance, Trump's VP pick

Donald Trump has named US Sen. JD Vance as his running mate, further elevating the Ohio Republican who has adopted the former president’s populist agenda after years of pointed criticism of Trump.

Vance, a freshman, entered Congress with the help of Trump, whose endorsement helped him win a contentious race in 2022.

Vance was critical of Trump in 2016, and six years later, Trump publicly humiliated Vance even after endorsing him in the 2022 election.

In the Senate, Vance has been an outspoken supporter of Trump and often votes in allegiance with the former president’s interests. He opposed a Ukraine aid bill earlier this year, adopting Trump’s criticism of providing more aid. He is also close with Donald Trump Jr.

Vance, a former venture capitalist, veteran and author, was reported to be among the candidates who received vice-presidential vetting materials from the Trump campaign.

Vance was a CNN contributor from March 2017 to March 2018.

What you need to know about the GOP's Trump-centered platform

Republicans adopted a new platform for Donald Trump’s third White House run that mainlines the former president’s policies and makes Trump himself a focus of the party. It is a fraction of the length of the 2016 platform and written in Trump’s voice.

Republicans also softened their language on the issue of abortion — angering some anti-abortion activists — and made clear that, like Trump, the party will favor a state-by-state local approach to the issue, meaning they will support efforts to ban abortion outright in some states and allow it to exist in others.

We annotated the full Republican Party platform — their first new platform since 2016.

Takeaways from day 1 of the Republican National Convention

Donald Trump stole the show at the Republican National Convention on Monday night in his first public appearance since surviving an assassination attempt two days ago.

A bandaged Trump, now the official Republican nominee for president, appeared alongside his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance.

Here are the top takeaways from the RNC’s first night:

Trump picks Vance Trump called Vance just 20 minutes before publicly announcing his VP pick on Truth Social, a source told CNN.

The choice reflects Trump’s belief that Vance is an effective communicator who can sell Trump’s populist agenda.

Vance now vs. then Vance is something of a double-edged sword for Republicans, who are betting on his ability to communicate Trump’s message but will have to contend with the senator’s own history.

Prior to running for his Senate seat in 2022, Vance was a strident critic of Trump — material Democrats are certain to replay for the duration of the campaign.

VP also-rans get their moments Delegates and convention-watchers heard from several other Republicans who Trump considered for the vice presidential nod, including South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott.

Ron Johnson’s Ron Burgundy moment Two days after the shooting, many Republican speakers delivered cooler-than-usual rhetoric — except Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who called Democratic policies a “clear and present danger to the country.”

Johnson’s spokesperson said it was a mistake, and that the senator delivered an old version of his remarks that had been erroneously loaded into the teleprompter instead of a new version calling for unity.

Democrats outraise GOP opponents in second quarter

Second-quarter fundraising reports show Democrats outraised Republicans in competitive congressional races, while several vulnerable Senate Democrats burned through cash.

The filing period spans April 1 through June 30, well before Saturday’s assassination attempt on Trump, and just three days after the CNN presidential debate.

Here are the main takeaways:

Senate Democrats maintained their financial edge

Democrats outraised their Republican opponents in the nine competitive Senate races on CNN’s list of the 10 seats most likely to flip, as they tried to defend their narrow majority.

House Democrats in most competitive races posted big hauls

Democratic candidates outraised their GOP opponents in 21 of the 22 House races rated as Toss-ups by The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter, the most competitive category. Republicans hold a razor-thin majority in the House.

Outside groups poised for big role

The reports also show the leading outside groups and super PACs hauling in huge sums as they prepare to blitz the battleground airwaves with campaign advertising.

In the fight for the Senate, the Senate Majority PAC, which is affiliated with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, raised $44.3 million and entered July with $124.3 million banked.

Trump’s growing Silicon Valley appeal

The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Elon Musk – who endorsed the former president Saturday less than an hour after he survived the assassination attempt – is prepared to plow about $45 million a month into a new group, America PAC, recently launched to support Trump’s bid.

Analysis: GOP sees divine intervention in Trump’s triumphant return

Donald Trump has gone from an insurrection to a resurrection.

The searing picture of a nation in dystopian decline that defines the ex-president’s politics was largely missing on the first night of the Republican National Convention.

In its place was a sense of the divine — a pulsating belief in miracles among thousands of Republican delegates and a feeling that God spared their hero after he was nearly killed in an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania on Saturday.

Thousands of Trump supporters in Milwaukee on Monday night hailed their leader, elevating him from MAGA superhero to saint-like status.

Trump, a white bandage over his wounded right ear, stood below the stands of the Milwaukee Bucks NBA arena. He didn’t speak to the crowd, but mouthed “thank you” over and over again.

Usually, Trump’s face projects anger or rage or sarcasm. But on Monday night, it wore unusual emotion. It looked as if tears welled in Trump’s eyes. A man who normally projects strength and seeks to dominant every room he enters betrayed a trace of wistfulness and vulnerability, as might befit someone coming to terms with their life being saved by a stroke of luck and a turn of the head.

Trump’s supporters have long seen him as a God-like figure and his own campaign has played into the trope with advertising. He’s styled himself as the secular prophet who leads a populist movement.

For Trump’s millions of American fans, Monday night was a validation of their faith in God and the ex-president and the righteousness of his mission.

f987da86f4,Financial Times,Chinese businesses target Vietnam and Mexico as trade tensions with US rise - Financial Times,"Chinese businesses are increasingly favouring investment in countries including Vietnam and Mexico as trade tensions rise between western governments and Beijing.

During the year to March, at least 41 Chinese manufacturing and logistics projects were announced for Mexico, while at least 39 were scheduled for Vietnam, according to the latest data from Financial Times subsidiary FDI Markets.

This represents the highest number of announced projects in either country since FDI Intelligence began tracking foreign investment news and company announcements in 2003, with both Mexico and Vietnam now overtaking the US as the top destinations for Chinese manufacturing and logistics projects. Thailand, Malaysia, Hungary and Egypt also welcomed record levels of Chinese projects in the year to the end of March.

The developments highlight how, as western multinationals and politicians seek to break decades of dependence on factories in China and limit the country’s role in supplying critical products, Chinese manufacturers are building their presence overseas.

Among the big Chinese investments is an up to $2bn Mexican plant announced by the local subsidiary of state-owned Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation.

With US President Joe Biden last month declaring fresh tariffs on $18bn-worth of Chinese goods, even small Chinese manufacturers are looking to spend their limited funds on overseas expansions.

As the US imports more from countries beyond China, Chinese businesses are also boosting exports to these countries.

The total value of Chinese exports to Mexico and Thailand more than doubled to $158.7bn between 2017 and 2023, according to China’s customs data. China’s overall exports grew just 49 per cent to $3.4tn over the same period.

Chinese exports of computer parts to Vietnam more than tripled to $1.7bn between 2017 and 2023, according to China’s General Administration of Customs.

However, the Eurasia Group consultancy pointed out in April that Vietnam’s trade surplus with the US had increased substantially not only because of an actual shift in production from China, but also because Chinese companies were simply rerouting products through Vietnam.

“Direct importing [from China] may be down. But one only has to look at indirect routes through which the US continues to be plugged into Chinese supply chains,” said Davin Chor, an economics professor at New Hampshire’s Dartmouth College.

Audrey Liang, a sales representative at knife and tool manufacturer Summit Enterprise, said that, having been based in a single factory in Yanjiang, in southern China’s Guangdong province, for 26 years, it is now fitting out a second site in Vietnam. It hopes the Vietnamese site will be operational by the end of next year.

Clients had asked Summit Enterprise to consider a site in Vietnam because of “political reasons” and the lower tariffs on Vietnamese goods, despite higher production costs and the lower skill levels of domestic workers, she said. “If the customers didn’t have this requirement, we wouldn’t go to Vietnam,” she added.

There are still many advantages to operating in China, said Jack Ye, a sales representative at Chinese backpack-maker Xiamen Obaili Manufacturing, noting that Chinese production had the advantage of better delivery times, costs and quality. But the company would consider overseas sites if Donald Trump, who has threatened even greater crackdowns on Chinese trade, was re-elected as US president, he said.

71535d477b,USA TODAY,Why Kamala Harris chose Tim Walz over Josh Shapiro as her running mate - USA TODAY,"PHILADELPHIA − With her surprise choice of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate Tuesday, Vice President Kamala Harris made a direct play to the Democratic base − not the electoral map − while betting that his plainspoken style will appeal to working-class voters in the Midwest.

In a rapid-fire search for vice president, Harris picked Walz, a folksy, often jovial 60-year-old former schoolteacher and congressman who emerged as the top choice among progressives and union allies.

Walz and his common-man persona got the nod over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, 51, whose popularly in his home state made him a strong option to help deliver what is widely seen as the most important battleground state of the election.

Throughout the 16-day vice presidential selection process, Shapiro was seen as the betting favorite and the stage was literally set for a hometown pick, with Harris holding a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday night to debut her selection. But momentum for Walz built in recent days from the left while progressive activists raised concerns about Shapiro's stance on Israel. Shapiro's defenders argued he was unfairly singled out because he is Jewish.

Taking her decision to the buzzer Tuesday, Harris opted for a governor who has pushed through liberal policies in Minnesota such as strengthening gun control, expanding paid family and medical leave for Minnesota workers and providing universal free meals for public school students.

A source close to the selection process said Harris was drawn to Walz's executive experience and record, her strong personal rapport with Walz and his Midwest roots and biography − a former high school football coach, hunter and gun owner, a veteran who served in the National Guard for 24 years and his connection with rural voters. As a congressman, Walz won in a district that Donald Trump, the former president and current Republican presidential nominee, carried.

More:Tim Walz vs. JD Vance: How Kamala Harris, Donald Trump's VP picks match up

Perhaps most significant, according to allies with firsthand knowledge of Harris' thinking, the campaign sees Walz as an effective communicator to take on Trump. Walz, chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, coined the newfound attack line that Trump and Republicans are ""weird"" − a message that Harris quickly adopted − in a shift from President Joe Biden's framing of Trump as a threat to democracy.

""He is incredibly dynamic. He is a fierce but happy warrior,"" said Maria Cardona, a Democratic strategist and Democratic National Committee member, arguing he's a messenger for working-class voters who have drifted from the Democratic column.

""He has something about him that really speaks to a lot of the voters, frankly, that the Democratic Party lost to Trump in 2016 − a lot of the same voters that Joe Biden was able to reach out to. But I think Governor Walz will be able to do that and more,"" Cardona said.

Shapiro's criticism from Democrats made for a riskier pick

Harris was officially named the Democratic nominee for president late Monday after a virtual roll-call DNC vote. Walz is expected to be a frequent Harris campaigner in his neighboring Wisconsin and Michigan, as well as Pennsylvania, which together make up the ""blue wall"" in Democrats' path for 270 electoral votes.

Others in the hunt for vice president were Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker.

Harris, whose campaign kept deliberations close to the vest until the end, announced Walz's selection by text message to supporters Tuesday morning, calling him a ""a battle-tested leader who has an incredible track record of getting things done for Minnesota families.""

More:Trump says GA Election Board members are 'pit bulls' for 'victory,' but is that their job?

The public jostling to be Harris' running mate exposed a struggle within the Democratic Party between the left wing that wanted Walz and others who argued the party should make an appeal to moderates and the crucial state of Pennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes by choosing Shapiro, a second-year governor and former state attorney general.

Shapiro attracted criticism from some Democrats because of concerns about how he would approach the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Like most Democratic officeholders, Shapiro has criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but supported the war against Hamas. Drawing additional pushback from the left was Shapiro's support for school vouchers that allow public money to go toward private schools.

A source familiar with the vetting process said the final decision didn't reflect shortcomings with Shapiro but rather Walz's strengths.

Yet also working against Shapiro was lobbying from fellow Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who according to reporting from Politico raised concerns with the Harris campaign that Shapiro is excessively focused on his own personal ambition.

In the end, Walz became the choice more likely to excite, not agitate, the Democratic base, even if he doesn't hail from a swing state like Shapiro.

""There's more considerations than just electoral ones,"" said William Howell, a University of Chicago political scientist, adding it was striking that Shapiro ""made it this far"" given his diverging viewpoints with Democrats in several areas.

Howell said the folksy optimism and progressive credentials of Walz contrasts starkly ""with what's going on in the Republican Party, where there's a lot of alarmism and a lot of talk about how the bottom is falling out of the country, a lot of grievance, a lot of anger.""

Yet Harris' calculus also opened attacks for Trump and Republicans.

Brad Todd, a Republican campaign strategist, said he expects the Trump campaign and Republicans to seize on ""the fact that the far-left pro-Hamas wing of the Democrat Party commandeered this VP selection.""

""Harris needs to win Pennsylvania more than she needs to win any other state, and she chose to not pick the most popular Democrat in that state because she's scared of offending campus protesters who support Hamas,"" Todd said. ""That's a pretty big lesson in her fortitude. Even with her own political survival at stake, she couldn't stand up to the most extreme wing of the Democratic Party.""

Republicans sharpen attacks on Walz's progressive record

As governor, Walz also signed into law protections for abortion access and legalizing marijuana. Republicans quickly pounced on Walz's liberal record as governor and his response to the protests in Minneapolis after the killing of George Floyd in 2020.

""By choosing Walz, Harris has doubled down on her radical vision to skyrocket prices, open the southern border to criminal aliens and drug cartels, and release murderers and rapists into our communities,"" said Brian Hughes, a senior adviser for the Trump campaign.

But Cardona pushed back on the notion that a Harris-Walz ticket will isolate more moderate voters or independents because it will be too progressive a ticket.

“They absolutely will try to paint him as a liberal, but it's not going to fly. It's going to land flat,” she said. “It's going to have no credibility, because the policies that he was able to pass in Minnesota, that he passed it by one-seat majority there, were incredibly popular in Minnesota.”

Mini Timmaraju, president and CEO of the liberal advoacy group Reproductive Freedom for All, praised Walz in an interview with USA TODAY as “a different kind of elected official.” When she was a chief of staff for a freshman congressional member, Timmaraju said, she worked closely with Walz, when he was a congressman, and his team.

“I don't know anyone who has a bad story about Tim Walz, which is saying something for the length of his political career,” she said.

Timmaraju said Walz will contrast with Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, in terms of reproductive freedoms and what it looks like to have a family in the United States. She criticized Vance’s remarks about some Democrats being “childless cat ladies” as “derogatory and negative about different types of families.”

Walz “wants to make sure all families are respected,” she said. “And he's kind. It's really stark difference between parties and characters as well. JD Vance thinks there's one way to have a family, and Tim Walz understands that that's just not the case of this country anymore.""

Overall, top Democrats believe Walz can help elevate Harris' message to voters.

Kiki McLean, a veteran Democratic political strategist who worked on campaigns for Bill and Hillary Clinton, said vice presidential picks are there to amplify the presidential nominee’s message and be their partner in winning.

87862f06d2,National Review,Leading Pro-Life Group Urges Republicans to Highlight Dem Extremism after DNC Abortion Fest - National Review,"America’s leading pro-life organization is urging Republicans to highlight the Democrats’ celebration of abortion during the Democratic National Convention last week, arguing that the party’s embrace of abortion as a positive good represents a political opportunity.

Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America crafted a memo to GOP leaders Friday describing the unapologetic pro-abortion messaging from Democratic leaders during the party’s convention, a major shift from the “safe, legal, and rare” position Democrats used to run on.

“As abortion is a central issue in campaigns across the country, it’s important to highlight how fringe the Democratic Party has become. They still can’t find a protection for the unborn or a limit on abortion that they can accept,” the memo says.

At the Democratic convention, free abortions were offered at a Planned Parenthood mobile clinic and demonstrators wore costumes celebrating abortion drugs, the memo notes. Abortion pills are an increasingly popular method for women seeking an abortion, and in June the Supreme Court threw out a case challenging the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of abortion pill mifepristone over plaintiffs lack of standing.

“The pro-abortion Left’s callous disregard for life was on full display at the DNC, which included a Planned Parenthood abortion bus offering free abortions and vasectomies outside the convention hall,” the memo reads. “Every abortion also included a coupon for a free hot dog, which matched a carnival-like vibe surrounding the bus. Eight unborn babies were reportedly aborted as a result.”

SBA’s memo cites the roster of pro-abortion activists invited to speak at the Democratic convention and points out that leading Democrats failed to articulate any limits they believe should be placed on abortion. Most Democrats referred to abortion as “reproductive freedom” during the party convention, a euphemism that ignores the significant number of abortions that come as a result of coercion.

“The DNC has shown us who Democrats really are. The Democratic Party wants abortion in every stage of pregnancy, with no limits,” the memo concludes.

“From their support for elective abortion even in the seventh, eighth and ninth month, to opposing medical care for infants born alive after failed abortions, Harris-Walz and Democrats across the country are far outside the mainstream.”

As governor Minnesota, Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz signed legislation legalizing coerced abortion and repealing the state’s informed consent law for women electing to abort their babies. Walz accompanied Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, earlier this year to a tour of a Planned Parenthood abortion center, making her the first sitting vice president to visit an abortion facility.

Democrats have successfully used freedom-centric messaging to win numerous state-level abortion ballot campaigns since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade over two years ago. This cycle, abortion remains a top issue and former president Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, has moderated on the issue in an attempt to neutralize liberal attacks.

“My Administration will be great for women and their reproductive rights,” Trump posted on Friday, further distancing himself from the GOP’s pro-life contingent. He has expressed support for leaving abortion legalization up to the states, a position his running mate, Senator J.D. Vance (R., Ohio) affirmed this weekend when he said Trump would repeal a national abortion ban if brought to his desk.

Mirroring Trump’s position, the Republicans unveiled a party platform last month that scaled back the party’s pro-life commitments, without much pushback from pro-life leaders, besides Trump’s old running mate, former vice president Mike Pence.",A blue and white Planned Parenthood mobile health clinic is parked on a sunny day with people sitting at a table with laptops in front of it.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x131 at 0x7D6B7E479C30>,2024-08-26 12:58:25+00:00,https://www.nationalreview.com,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/leading-pro-life-group-urges-republicans-to-highlight-dem-extremism-after-dnc-abortion-fest/,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.8 ],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/87862f06d2.png
b8ce1487b4,The Washington Post,Arrest of Telegram’s Durov inflames debate over online crime and free speech - The Washington Post,"French authorities said Monday that they had arrested Telegram founder and CEO Pavel Durov in a probe of illegal child abuse activity on the messaging app, taking the most dramatic action to date in the global fight between officials and tech companies over limits to harmful content.

Durov was being temporarily detained in connection with distributing child sex abuse material and drugs, money laundering and working with organized crime, according to a statement released by French prosecutor Laure Beccuau.

The accusations also included improper use of cryptography and failure to allow authorized law enforcement interception, flash points in the efforts by some governments to force companies to reveal private messages between users. The prosecutor’s statement said the probe is of an unnamed person, allowing for the possibility that Durov is not the ultimate target.

Durov’s arrest reignites a fierce debate pitting free-speech advocates, including X owner Elon Musk, against governmental efforts to police the role of social media and messaging platforms in spreading illegal and false information. It also casts a fresh spotlight on Telegram, which online experts said has created a uniquely ripe environment for harmful activity, even as X and Meta’s Facebook and Instagram have drawn similar scrutiny.

The action against Durov, a Russian-born billionaire who lives in Dubai and was detained over the weekend at the Bourget airport outside Paris after arriving from Azerbaijan in his private jet, also renews debate over whether tech companies should be held liable for the content that flourishes on their platforms. (Durov is a dual citizen of the United Arab Emirates and France, according to his company.)

U.S. law, like that of France, does not protect platforms from prosecution over knowingly permitting transmission of sex abuse or terrorist material, said Daphne Keller of Stanford University’s Cyber Policy Center.

Former Facebook anti-terror chief Brian Fishman said on Threads that the issue was not just insufficient moderation, a criticism many platforms have faced. Telegram, he wrote, “has been the key hub for ISIS for a decade. It tolerates [child sexual abuse material]. It’s ignored reasonable [law-enforcement] engagement for YEARS. It’s not ‘light’ content moderation; it’s a different approach entirely.”

Others saw a slippery slope in the action against Durov.

“Arresting platform executives because of their alleged failures to sufficiently moderate content, even content as disturbing and harmful as content that harms children, starts us down a dangerous road that threatens free expression and gives too much power to the government to suppress speech,” said Kate Ruane, director of the Free Expression Project at the Washington-based Center for Democracy & Technology.

Telegram did not respond Monday to a request for comment. On Sunday, it said on X: “Telegram abides by EU laws, including the Digital Services Act — its moderation is within industry standards and constantly improving. Telegram’s CEO Pavel Durov has nothing to hide and travels frequently in Europe.”

Telegram is one of the most popular messaging apps globally, with more than 950 million users. Law enforcement agencies across the globe have long focused on the app because it has become a tool of choice for child predators, terrorist organizations, narcotics traffickers and far-right extremists for communicating and organizing their activities. The app allows for private group chats and messaging, a feature cyber experts say creates an ideal environment for illegal activity.

National governments have barred the app or requested that it take down content for its role in inciting hateful activity and spreading illegal content. Brazil temporarily banned Telegram in 2023 amid investigations into neo-Nazi groups that allegedly used the app to conduct school attacks.

That same year, India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology requested that the site take down all child sexual abuse imagery. The European Union has started to enforce broader laws governing social networks and meting out consequences for breaching them.

Russia’s relationship with Telegram has been fraught. Durov left the country in 2014 after he was pressured to turn over information about users of his social networking company VKontakte, which he instead sold to Kremlin-friendly investors.

Russia and its allies have made extensive use of Telegram to spread views, recruit spies and give directions to troops. Ukraine has done so as well.

Russian President Vladimir Putin was in Baku, Azerbaijan, at the same time as Durov but did not meet him, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. The presence of the two men in the Azerbaijani capital led to speculation that Durov had sought protection from Putin in France — or that France was seeking encryption codes for intelligence purposes.

Durov’s detention has been met by outcry among Russia’s political elite. Margarita Simonyan, a Kremlin propagandist who serves as editor in chief of the RT news channel, called on Russian officials and those who used the Telegram app for “sensitive” messages to “immediately” delete their messages “because Durov has been detained in order to take the [encryption] keys,” she wrote in a post on Telegram.

Russian newspapers were flooded with stories about his arrest. One, Nezavisimaya Gazeta, said his arrest “threatens to become a blow to Russia.”

French President Emmanuel Macron said Monday that Durov’s arrest was part of an “ongoing judicial investigation,” and that politics had played no part in it.

“France is deeply committed to freedom of expression and communication, to innovation, and to the spirit of entrepreneurship,” Macron said in a post on X. “It will remain so.”

Telegram’s terms of service say it does not allow users to post pornographic content on public channels but also states that it does not moderate private messages between users or group chats that are not public. The company states it does not comply with official requests for data. “To this day, we have disclosed 0 bytes of user data to third parties, including governments,” it said on its website.

Experts said Durov’s Telegram flouted the laws on child abuse and other issues in many jurisdictions.

Alex Stamos, former director of the Stanford Internet Observatory, said his team there found that “Telegram is a key component of the ecosystem of individuals trading and selling child sexual abuse materials, and is the only major platform to implicitly allow the exchange of CSAM [child sex abuse material] on private channels, many of which are not end-to-end encrypted.” Stamos is now chief information security officer at cybersecurity company SentinelOne.

A June report from the Stanford Internet Observatory found that Telegram was the only major platform not to prohibit illegal material in private channels and chats. “Telegram has also been observed by SIO as failing to perform even basic content enforcement on public channels, with instances of known CSAM being detected and reported by our ingest systems,” the report said.

Jean-Michel Bernigaud, secretary general of Ofmin, a French police agency focused on preventing violence against minors, said in a LinkedIn post Monday that Durov’s arrest was related to the app’s inability to deal with offensive content against minors. “At the heart of the case is the absence of moderation and cooperation on the part of the platform,” Bernigaud said, “especially in the fight against child sex crimes.”

Telegram is one of a number of social media and messaging apps to face complaints about insufficient moderation or failure to act against child sex abuse content, fake news, disinformation, hate speech, and extremist groups and ideologies promoting violence.

Rights and monitoring groups have accused Facebook owner Meta of contributing to real-world violence against the Rohingya community in Myanmar by failing to act against the spread of fake news and hate speech on its platforms.

Meanwhile, a UNESCO study in 2022 concluded that nearly half of Holocaust-related content shared publicly on Telegram contained denial or distortion, a rate higher than Twitter, TikTok or Facebook.

Musk and others condemned the arrest as an attack on free speech with drastic implications. Musk posted that the future could include “being executed for liking a meme.” Chris Pavlovski, CEO of Rumble Video, said France had threatened his online video platform and had crossed “a red line” by taking action against Durov “reportedly for not censoring speech.”

Catherine Belton and Naomi Nix contributed to this report.

f5189faace,The Guardian,"Yurts, a cruise ship, my flat: all the city’s a stage at the Edinburgh fringe - The Guardian","Of all the extraordinary things about the Edinburgh fringe, the easiest to take for granted is that performances in the world’s biggest arts festival take place almost anywhere other than actual theatres. Over the years, I have even hosted three shows in my own flat, including a production of The Tempest in which Ferdinand was found in the kitchen frying eggs for Miranda. In other people’s homes, I have seen one about sex trafficking and another about sexual assault, both all the more powerful for their intimacy.

I was in an audience of three sitting in the back of a moving car for an underworld murder mystery. I sat poolside for a Ukrainian version of Othello in which the actors swam lengths of the old Infirmary Street baths. I skulked around the clothes rails in Debenhams after hours for a play about food consumption and watched a site-specific dance piece in room 206 of the Caledonian hotel.

I have seen outdoor shows near the rare specimens of the Royal Botanic Garden, seen others in tents on top of Calton Hill, one in some public toilets and another on a squash court. Then there was the old washhouse, the football stadium, the woods and the allotment.

This has been going on ever since the festival began due to some combination of pressure on space, creative exuberance and financial necessity. In 1947, before the term fringe had been coined, the eight companies that arrived in the city to share in the spirit of the inaugural Edinburgh international festival performed in whatever buildings they could find. They included a YMCA, a cinema restaurant and Dunfermline Abbey, 18 miles out of town.

Today, you don’t think twice about going into lecture rooms, church halls and masonic lodges (no handshake required), or being entertained in sports halls and rooms above pubs. The multi-arts venue Summerhall, newly safe after the signing of a three-year lease, is a success in part because of its history as a veterinary school: actors perform on stages where animal carcasses were once dissected.

If you go off the beaten path this year, you can see a variety show on the fourth floor of Harvey Nichols, an object-theatre performance in Tills bookshop and a piece of physical theatre in Port O’Leith boxing club.

Mooring in Leith until 15 August is Playbill’s FringeShip, a cruise liner whose 1,300 guests can see shows in the onboard theatre when the dedicated shuttle bus brings them back from town. “Because the fringe and the Royal Military Tattoo are major international tourist attractions in August, it can be difficult for foreign and local tourists to secure hotel accommodations in the Edinburgh area,” says Ed Plog, president of Playbill Travel. “To solve that problem, Playbill Travel brought many available hotel rooms to Edinburgh by way of the Ambition cruise ship.”

The lineup includes US comedians Rachel Redleaf and Tim Murray, and West End performers Rob Madge, Frances Ruffelle and Norman Bowman. The cheapest rate of £1,250 for a week might sound steep, but it is less than you would pay in a city-centre budget hotel this month.

To see how the other half live, I catch up with comedian and promoter Rick Molland of the city’s year-round Hoots Comedy club on the day he has overseen construction of three yurts. One seats 55, one 25 and the third is for a small beer garden. They nestle beside the pedestrian underpass to Bristo Square: the site previously occupied by a bus that hosted comedy on the top deck.

“It’s like running Glastonbury all over the city,” says Molland, who also runs the Scottish comedy festival in two nearby pubs. “My tech team all signed on to put audio equipment together and I’m like, ‘Let’s go make a yurt.’”

While we are talking, a woman walks by carrying an enormous sign. It is the venue number for her Charles Darwin-themed walking tour. The tour begins at the same junction and she shouts over to us, wondering where she can hang it.

Outdoor shows have logistical challenges of their own, but every fringe performer has to adapt to the city’s particular conditions. Over at the Beehive Inn, Molland is performing with Danny O’Brien and Billy Kirkwood in An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman. He loves the 60-seat room there, even when competing with noise from the bar and the nightly boom of fireworks from the castle.

“I used to have an inferiority complex about my venue having a bit of noise bleed,” he says. “Then I went to a show in the Gilded Balloon and the act had to write in bits to deal with the cheering from next door, it was so loud. There’s no perfect room. Some of the rooms up at the university are closets throughout the year … The fringe is put together like an Escher painting.”

The programme in the yurts here focuses on clowning and experimentation, aiming to offset costs with bar and food sales. The performers pay nothing upfront for the venue, which takes a 10% split of tickets. Molland rails against the costs elsewhere on the fringe. “People can have sell-out runs and lose money,” he says. “How’s that viable? It’s all based on the idea that you’ll get the TV people in. It’s sold on this myth. The idea here is that you take a risk on people.”

He argues some shows benefit from less-than-ideal conditions: “Personally, I prefer my comedy dirty and sweaty. But it depends on the show. Years ago, I saw Doug Stanhope doing a basement room and it’s one of the greatest comedy gigs I’ve ever seen. A couple of years later, he was back and they had put air conditioning in and it just killed it.”

I check out four shows in less-familiar venues and what is striking about each is how well they are matched to their surroundings. I return to the Hoots Big Yurt to see Freddie Hayes in The Magic Lady. It is a deliciously daft faux-magic show made all the more enjoyable by our proximity to Hayes and each other. There are 40 of us nestled in so tightly that her interaction feels less like audience participation than a family party. With her OTT gurning, quick wit and cartoon playfulness, Hayes receives roars of laughter.

On Leith Walk, Little Plaza describes itself as a “baby play cafe corner”, an amalgam of coffee shop, creche, photography studio and playgroup. Here, Tim Licata is performing A Magic Morning!, part of PBH’s Free Fringe, to keep himself busy before his evening show, Close Up and Personal, which he performs in a converted shipping container at the Assembly Rooms.

“I didn’t realise there were mirrors behind me,” he quips mid-set in Little Plaza’s sunlit studio, with its high sash-window looking out to trees on the back green. He is a skilled enough conjuror to beguile his capacity audience all the same: invisible coins fly through the air, foam balls spill out from unsuspecting hands and a cut rope comes back together.

“It’s a fun challenge, to use the atmosphere of the place you’re in,” says Licata. “This is a cafe. It’s a fun space. So I want to try to make the show that way. I’m doing another show in Lauriston Castle, so again, I’ll be using the atmosphere of that place.”

A couple of streets away at No11 Boutique Hotel & Brasserie, Liz Mance is taking the same attitude in A Cup of Tea With George Eliot. You will find her beyond the reception, through the breakfast room, down the corridor and into the lounge. Sitting next to a baby grand, she is wearing a deep blue skirt that matches the walls of the high-ceilinged room. The capacity audience of around 20 sit with tea and cake on armchairs, as if they are confidants of the Middlemarch author, with her scandalous private life and literary genius. They are a book-loving crowd who delight in Mance’s crisply delivered character study.

For the first time in its history, the Hibernian Supporters Club has opened itself to the fringe for Athens of the North. Beneath a low white-tiled ceiling in the Pat Stanton Suite, named after the much-loved player and manager, actor Mark Hannah performs three interlinking monologues rich in the culture and place names of the city. Punchily written and powerfully performed, these portraits of a single dad, an elderly woman and a luckless visitor hold the audience spellbound.

“This venue is intrinsic to the themes and the politics in this piece,” says Hannah. “I’m not sure a show like this, that is about the people of Edinburgh, would land in the same way if it was in a church hall in the Old Town or one of the established venues. You can feel the ghosts in a place like this. It’s a really deep connection which feeds the story you’re trying to tell.”","An image showing a street scene with a large, colorful yurt-like structure, people walking around, and a cruise ship in the background.

Compare the best utility companies

Methodology

The best utility stocks included above all trade on a major U.S. stock exchange and meet the following criteria:

Consensus analyst recommendation of “hold” or “buy or better.” A strong number of analyst ratings of “hold” or “buy or better” indicates an expectation the stock will perform well.

Market capitalization of at least $1 billion. If a company has a leading market share and competitive advantages in a sizable industry, it will have a market cap of greater than $1 billion. Companies with market caps under $1 billion typically get very little media and analyst coverage and scrutiny and can be higher-risk investments than larger, more visible companies.

An Altimeter overall grade of at least a B. In selecting the best stocks for this list, we applied a screen, considering only stocks rated a B or better by Altimeter. The overall grade takes into account profitability, earning stability, valuation and earning expectations. Grades of B or higher for both are stocks that are ranked in the top quarter of nearly 5,000 stocks in Altimeter’s stock database. This indicates that these companies have strong valuations with the ability to improve returns.

Net profits. Profitable companies have demonstrated they have a viable business model and are less exposed to risks such as fluctuations in interest rates and cyclical economic downturns. If a company is not profitable, it is eventually forced to rely on debt or dilutive share offerings to fund its operations.

Dividend yield of at least 3%. Investors typically turn to the utilities sector for reliability, stability and income. A dividend yield of at least 3% makes a utility stock attractive even if it doesn’t have a particularly impressive growth profile.

Why other stocks didn’t make the cut

Utility stocks are known for their stability, but that also means the valuation upside for many utilities sector stocks is limited. For a utility stock to be worthwhile, it must have either a unique growth opportunity or an attractive dividend yield. Some of the best utility stocks have both.

Many utility stocks may be attractive to value investors at first glance because they have low earnings multiples. However, if a utility stock has stagnant or declining revenue or an extremely high debt load, it may be a value trap rather than a value stock.

Final verdict

The utilities sector has plenty of stocks with attractive dividend yields and the possibility of generating robust long-term gains for investors. Utility stocks may be a particularly attractive option in 2024 given market expectations for falling interest rates.

One of our top recommendations for the best utility stocks is NRG Energy, which has an attractive valuation, a long-term growth runway and a 3% dividend. There are no major flags indicated by Altimeter’s risk assessment tool.

How to buy utility stocks

Investors who are comfortable analyzing individual utility stocks can create a personalized portfolio by choosing those they believe will outperform their peers. For example, you can buy shares of the best utility stocks included above. However, before buying shares of an individual stock, ensure you understand the company's business and financial metrics and are comfortable using basic fundamental valuation strategies. You can reduce risk by diversifying your investments into many stocks instead of concentrating on a few.

You can also invest in utility stocks via utilities sector exchange-traded funds, such as the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU). Utilities sector ETFs provide an easy way to add diversified exposure to dozens of utility stocks at a time. However, while utility stock ETFs help reduce the risks associated with individual utility stocks, they also limit the upside investors can experience if they focus on a handful of top-performing companies. Utility stock ETFs also charge management fees in the form of expense ratios that can eat into returns over time.

Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

Yes. The three primary defensive stock market sectors are utilities, consumer staples and health care. Customers need water, gas and electricity at all stages of the economic cycle.

Yes. The utilities sector hasn’t historically been a market leader, but investors can turn to the utilities sector to make their investment portfolio more defensive or to find reliable dividend stocks that generate steady income. Investors can also improve their returns by identifying utility stocks that will likely outperform their peers.

Yes. Utility stocks have historically performed relatively well during periods of elevated U.S. inflation. Gains in utilities sector shares have generally outpaced gains in the consumer price index during those periods, making utilities sector stocks an effective hedge against inflation.","The image features a solid blue circle with the text 'USA TODAY' in white, set against a dark grey background.",<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x117 at 0x7D6B7E818490>,2024-02-29 15:39:11+00:00,https://www.usatoday.com,https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/investing/best-utility-stocks/,['Business and Finance' 'Opinion/Editorial'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/e6935fae69.png
20f16f562c,The Federalist,Will Racial Paranoia Still Work For Democrats In 2024? - The Federalist,"“It’s natural to wonder if democracy you hear about actually works for you,” Joe Biden told graduates of the historical black college of Morehouse. “What is democracy if black men are being killed in the street? What is democracy if a trail of broken promises still leaves black communities behind? What is democracy if you have to be 10 times better than anyone else to get a fair shot?”

These are three of the most pernicious and divisive lies about American life.

To begin with, the notion that the only way for a black graduate to succeed in America is to stratospherically overachieve is an obvious myth. The United States isn’t a utopia for black Americans — or anyone else, for that matter. Black neighborhoods are plagued by terrible Democrat- and state-run schools, the welfare state, and other factors. There is plenty for individuals to overcome.

But most companies, schools, and institutions these days go out of their way to find nonwhite candidates to diversify their operations. According to Morehouse’s own statistics, nearly 83 percent of its graduates have a job right now or are continuing their education. The 70 percent employment rate is the same as the national average. The top 20 employers of Morehouse graduates include industry giants like Deloitte, Cigna, Google, Lockheed Martin, and AT&T. The average starting salary for a Morehouse graduate is $76,543. The average starting salary of a person with a bachelor’s degree in the United States is $68,516.

Could it be better? Yes. But if black Americans in the United States formed a nation unto themselves, they would have a higher living standard and more wealth per capita than nearly any other country in the world — including most of Europe. The contention that black Americans are systemically held back in the job market is paranoia.

Worse, Biden insinuated that the state is targeting black lives.

In 2021, a Skeptic Research Center poll found that nearly half of liberals believed approximately 1,000 unarmed black men were murdered in one year by cops. Twenty percent of conservatives agreed. Over half of people with “very liberal” political views believe 1,000 or more unarmed black men are killed by cops in a year (14 percent of them believe that number is 10,000.) Twenty-six percent of “liberals” believe it is 1,000.

Yet according to a database compiled by Mapping Police Violence, the actual number of black men, armed and unarmed, killed by the police this year (as of this writing) is 94 — almost all of them in incidents where police officers were cleared of wrongdoing.

Cops fatally shoot just over 1,000 civilians per year, almost all of them dangerous, very few of them unarmed. One innocent person is too many, but the number is nowhere near what most Democrats have been programmed to believe.

Even in the most infamous cases of police shootings against black Americans, none are proven to have a racial component — and that includes the murder of George Floyd and the “clean” shooting of Michael Brown, which had its anniversary the other day.

Again, this is not to say there aren’t racists in the world — hardly — but the perception created and fostered by the left of a nation where black men are hunted by cops is a politically expedient lie.

Perhaps the most harmful myth spread by Biden, one central to the Democrats’ messaging, is “voter suppression.” Millions of Democrats now believe the GOP systemically stops black Americans from participating in “democracy” when, aside from some isolated incidents, no such effort exists in the United States. The voter suppression myth is effective because it is always evolving and open-ended and tied to genuine historical wrongdoing. Now even the most basic voter-integrity law — showing ID, for instance — becomes Jim Crow 2.0 to the professional Democrat.

A Kaiser Family Foundation survey of black voters before the 2022 midterms found that seven in 10 said they were concerned about “voter suppression interfering with a fair and accurate election in their state.” When asked if they ever personally experienced voter suppression, only half said that “they have experienced waiting in long lines at their polling place in the past, and one in five have experienced potential voter suppression such as having their registration or identification questioned.”

Which is to say that fears of voter suppression have been so normalized that black Americans who face ordinary inconveniences — typically in blue states and Democrat-run cities — such as standing on a line or having an ID check, believe they’re victims of systemic white oppression.

It is easier to cast a ballot in the United States than ever. Easier here than anywhere else in the world. Most voters don’t even need to leave their homes to do it. In every state, they can request a ballot in the mail. You can get it in a dozen or so languages. You can get it weeks before an election. It is easier to vote than to buy virtually anything online. Anyone can do it.

So sending young people out into the world convinced that their country hates them is a deception meant to keep nonwhite Americans deferential to a single political party. Do they believe it? There are many reasons not to vote for Republicans, but none of Biden’s scaremongering stands up to scrutiny.","Joe Biden, dressed in a maroon robe, stands at a podium with the seal of the President of the United States, addressing an audience with a blurred background featuring a blue banner with a yellow star and other individuals.",<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x128 at 0x7D6BCAEFE680>,2024-05-23 00:00:00+00:00,https://thefederalist.com,https://thefederalist.com/2024/05/23/will-racial-paranoia-still-work-for-democrats-in-2024/,['Politics' 'Opinion/Editorial'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/20f16f562c.png
8fd26c22fa,CNN,‘Could it have been avoided?’ Local cops detail breakdown in efforts to stop Trump’s would-be assassin - CNN,"One minute before former President Donald Trump’s motorcade rolled onto the site of his now infamous rally in rural Butler, Pennsylvania, a local SWAT officer stationed in a nearby building peered down from his second-floor perch and saw a young man pull something out of his pocket.

The officer, Greg Nicol, zoomed in with his binoculars and saw that the skinny young man with long hair and glasses was holding a rangefinder, a device used by shooters to calculate the distance to a target. He had it pointed directly at the stage where Trump was about to speak.

“This just isn’t right,” Nicol recalled thinking in a recent interview with CNN. When the mysterious young man disappeared a short time later, his instinct told him something else: “I gotta find this dude.”

In his most comprehensive public statements to date, Nicol, as well as several of his colleagues who spoke to CNN, shared new details about what they described as poor planning for the rally, a dramatic communication breakdown between local police and the Secret Service, and bitter finger-pointing in the aftermath of what is widely seen as a massive law enforcement failure.

Nicol’s sighting of Thomas Matthew Crooks with the rangefinder was a pivotal moment that began a ticking clock to possibly apprehend the 20-year-old would-be assassin before he somehow made his way onto a rooftop with an AR-15 style firearm and came perilously close to killing the former president.

“Could it have been avoided? Absolutely,” said Det. Pat Young, commander of the Beaver County SWAT team and Nicol’s boss. “And should it have been avoided? Yeah, absolutely.”

A second-floor snipers’ perch

Days before Trump stepped onto the stage at his July 13 rally at the Butler Farm Show grounds, about an hour north of Pittsburgh, the Secret Service began implementing a plan to protect him. As with other such events, the plan relied, in part, on help from local law enforcement.

In this case, that meant dozens of police officers, sheriff’s deputies, state troopers, paramedics and others, stationed in various areas emanating outward from the stage where Trump was to speak.

A pair of Secret Service counter snipers, dubbed Hercules 1 and Hercules 2, surveilled the crowd from directly above and behind the stage. Other snipers from local SWAT teams in Butler and surrounding counties took up positions in a grandstand and, in Nicol’s case, on the second floor of a building on the sprawling campus of a company called American Glass Research. One of the AGR buildings was roughly 150 yards from the stage where Trump would later speak, but outside the perimeter established by the Secret Service.

Following a general briefing that morning by a law enforcement official from Butler County, where the rally was being held, Nicol said he and other snipers were assigned to be inside the AGR building and directed to several windows on the second floor with a view of the entry area to the rally grounds and the stage where Trump would speak.

A Butler sniper leader who met Nicol and his partners at the AGR building told them their mission was to look out those windows and scan the area for threats, Nicol said. They were instructed to remain covert. They set up their rifles on tripods so that the barrels were a foot or two inside the open windows to prevent them from being seen from outside.

‘He knows you guys are up there’

For more than five hours, the three snipers – Nicol, a fellow SWAT team member from Beaver County named Jason Woods and a third shooter from Butler County’s SWAT team – remained hidden in their second-floor perch without incident.

At approximately 4:26 p.m., Woods was clocking out for the day. As he left, he saw someone sitting at a picnic table outside as he exited the building dressed in camouflage and carrying his gear. Woods texted his counterparts that their cover was blown.

“He knows you guys are up there,” Woods wrote. Authorities now believe that was the first time law enforcement placed eyes on Crooks.

Nicol thought little of the text at the time, he said. Nor did he immediately connect it to a slightly built, long haired young man he saw sitting below the window where he was stationed at AGR about 45 minutes later.

Something about the kid and his presence there didn’t seem right, Nicol thought. He couldn’t articulate exactly what that was, he said, but whatever he was feeling prompted him to take the young man’s picture at 5:14 p.m.

By this time, the Farm Show grounds were packed with Trump supporters, and the former president’s motorcade was 19 minutes away.

‘What is going on here?’

At 5:32 p.m., Nicol again looked down from a second-story window and saw the same kid. This is when he zoomed in with his binoculars and noticed the range finder. Instantly, his assessment of the young man was elevated from simply odd to potential threat.

Over the next 13 minutes, Nicol attempted to pass his concerns up the chain of command. He radioed the local command post controlled by Butler County law enforcement and notified them of the kid with the rangefinder. He also texted photos of the young man to one of his Beaver County bosses and suggested he forward the photos to someone in the local command post, which he did.

The Secret Service and Pennsylvania State Police were stationed at a separate command post nearby with which neither Nicol nor his Beaver County supervisor were able to directly communicate, he said. However, a transcript of Butler’s radio communications – first reported by the Washington Post – details a phone call from a Butler County commander to a state police officer relaying Nicol’s warning. The state trooper then conveyed the information to Secret Service agents also in the command post at approximately 5:44 p.m.

As the clock ticked toward Trump taking the stage, Nicol went from window to window on the second floor of the AGR building looking for the kid and wondering what was taking so long for help to arrive.

“I don’t see any patrolmen or anybody outside looking for him,” he told CNN. “It’s like, what is going on here?”

‘Coming and going and disappearing’

While Nicol scanned the crowd for Crooks, poor cell service further hindered law enforcement communication. “Units be advised internet and cell service is down,” an officer is heard saying at 5:48 p.m. on Butler’s radio. A minute later, a sheriff’s deputy radioed. “Your picture is probably not going to go through because I don’t have any service,” the Post reported.

Four minutes after that, the Secret Service counter sniper team leader emailed his teams that local law enforcement was looking for a suspicious individual outside of the perimeter, lurking around the AGR building.

Just after 6 p.m., Nicol, looking out a window on the northwest side of the building, spotted Crooks again. This time the young man was running and carrying a black backpack.

Instinctively, Nicol left his second-floor post and bounded down the stairs in an attempt to keep eyes on the suspect who seemed to be “coming and going and disappearing.”

When he pushed open the door, the kid was nowhere to be seen. Just then two police officers pulled up outside AGR and Nicol shouted to them about where he’d last seen the suspect. The officers took off on foot in opposite directions around the sprawling AGR complex.

‘Someone’s on the roof’

Trump by this time was on stage and addressing the crowd. Nicol said he could hear his voice booming over the loudspeakers.

Video discovered by the FBI shows Crooks pulling himself onto the roof of the AGR building at around 6:06 p.m. Shortly thereafter, a local law enforcement officer reported over the radio, “Someone’s on the roof. I have someone on the roof with white shorts.” A Butler supervisor then passed the information to the Secret Service command post at 6:09 p.m., according to the transcript obtained by the Post.

The Hercules snipers covering Trump from above and behind the stage then turned to face the AGR property to the north. Almost simultaneously, an officer being boosted up to the roof saw the gunman, who spun around and pointed his rifle at the officer. Defenseless, the officer let go and dropped to the ground.

Seconds later, Crooks opened fire, striking Trump in the ear, killing one rally attendee and wounding two others. A Secret Service sniper then fatally shot Crooks.

Finger pointing begins

Two days after the shooting, Young, the Beaver County SWAT team commander, called a meeting of all his officers who had been at the rally.

Young himself was off that day and raced to the scene after the gunman opened fire. In addition to Nicol and Woods in the AGR building, he had eight other officers there in various roles.

A veteran cop who did two tours in Iraq with the Army National Guard, Young took stock of what his team members had to say. While the outcome was no doubt tragic, he was confident his people had done their jobs and performed admirably.

Neither Young nor his officers, however, were prepared for the recriminations that followed.

Secret Service directors, the Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner and lawmakers criticized local law enforcement’s actions during several high-profile congressional hearings. They said they assumed securing the AGR complex had been the responsibility of the local cops and falsely suggested officers didn’t want to be on the roof because of the heat that day. They claimed Nicol had abandoned his post and that the snipers inside the AGR building could have seen Crooks if they had been more vigilant.

The accusations prompted Young and the Beaver County District Attorney, Nate Bible, to come to their officers’ defense. In a July interview with ABC, they first shared some of their frustrations about the poor planning and siloed communications in the lead up to and during the event.

In interviews with CNN, Nicol and Woods said they had expected more thorough instructions from the Secret Service and complained about a lack of clarity about the full security plan. The snipers said they never spoke directly to Secret Service agents in preparation for the event – and had not been asked to share their accounts, despite playing a pivotal role in identifying the threat.

On Friday – nearly four weeks after the attack – Young said he finally received notice from the Secret Service that investigators wanted to interview him and his officers.

“I can’t believe that the Secret Service hasn’t talked to any of our people,” he said prior to Friday’s reach out. He said he wanted to iron out what went wrong in Butler as his county is already fielding requests for future campaign events.

Some of the failures, officers said, have become painfully obvious in the wake of the shooting. Most of all, perhaps, the need for better inter-agency communications.

On one end of the fairgrounds, Butler County occupied a command center from which they could communicate with their own officers and the teams from Washington and Beaver County that supported them during the rally. In a different location, the Secret Service and state police set up another command post. Local law enforcement officers, however, couldn’t directly communicate with state troopers or the Secret Service. Even Butler’s command at times had to use personal cell phones to contact state and federal agents – a problem on a day when cell service was unreliable due to the number of people in the area.

Another source of frustration revolved around plans for the AGR site itself, located outside of the perimeter established by the Secret Service. Nicol said he and Woods assumed patrol officers would protect access to the building because, as snipers inside, they would not be able to see, or immediately follow, someone close to the building.

But that didn’t happen.

New video reveals frustration

Nicols, Woods, Young and other Beaver County officers weren’t the only ones to express concerns about the Secret Service planning.

Body cam footage released this week by the Butler Township Police Department, shows an officer responding to the AGR property in the minutes after Crooks opened fire complaining that he had urged the Secret Service to post an officer there several days before the Trump rally.

“I f**king told them,” the officer says, according to the video released in response to a public records request from CNN. “I talked to the Secret Service guys. They were like, ‘Yeah, no problem,’” the officer adds.

Amid multiple ongoing inquiries into what the former Secret Service director acknowledged was the worst operational failure in decades, agency officials have backed off their earlier criticism of local law enforcement and have accepted full responsibility for not preventing the attack on Trump.

In a statement released Thursday in response to the bodycam footage, Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the agency “appreciates our local law enforcement partners, who acted courageously as they worked to locate the shooter that day.”

“The attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump was a U.S. Secret Service failure, and we are reviewing and updating our protective policies and procedures in order to ensure a tragedy like this never occurs again,” Guglielmi said.","A group of people, including a man in a white shirt and a woman in a blue suit, are embracing in a celebratory manner against a clear blue sky.

c08110bc5e,Forbes,Shakedown Or Fair Shake? How To Get Pay Equity For Women - Forbes,"The month where much of the world celebrates Mother’s Day is a good time to look at progress for mothers - and for all women. The original Mother’s Day was not invented - as many suspect - by stationery companies and florists, but rather by three women, including Julia Ward Howe who, after the losses of the Civil War and the frustration with men’s decision-making, said, ""Arise, women!” Howe wrote, “Say firmly: ‘We will not have great questions decided by irrelevant agencies.”

Moving to modern day, has there been progress for women in the workplace? Yes, some.

The McKinsey 2023 Report on Women in the Workplace in the US and Canada noted, “Since 2015, the number of women in the C-suite has increased from 17 to 28 percent, and the representation of women at the vice president and senior vice president levels has also improved signiﬁcantly.” In Singapore, women held just 7.5% of board seats in the top 100 listed companies in 2013; that number rose to 22.7% in 2023. In Japan, female executives in prime market-listed companies rose from 10.7 percent in 2020 to 11.4 percent in July 2022.

And can we expect more? Yes, a bit.

In 2022 the European Parliament directed firms with more than 250 employees that, by 2026, at least 40% of non-executive directors must be women. In Japan, where only 18% of directors are women, the government recently told big businesses to get to 30% by 2030.

And is it as good as it sounds? No.

Fair Shake is a newly-released book that is shaking things up in the world of gender equity, with important lessons for leaders. Written by three legal scholars - Naomi Cahn, June Carbone, and Nancy Levit - the book points out that women continue to be discriminated against in the workplace. The book focuses on the US, but the insights resonate globally. While the gender pay gap has narrowed statistically over a long period of time, it is partially due to declining wages for poorly educated men (rather than progress for women). Using examples from Wal-Mart to General Electric to investment banks to medical practices, “Fair Shake” outlines structural issues in the economy and what leaders need to do about them.

Winner-Take-All

The book describes our economy as a “winner-take-all” system where business executives have the opportunity to amass a large share of resources for themselves and their chosen team. Partly driven by the capital markets, rewards are paid primarily for meeting short-term goals, like sales and earnings. To generate these, many top leaders pit employees against each other, creating hyper-competition and endurance contests. Employees become insecure and some engage in bullying, harassing, and dominating behaviors. It is in these types of companies where greater gender disparities are shown.

For example, in the1950’s-60’s, CEO pay was roughly 20 times average worker pay; by 2000 that number was 390. A major reason for the increase was greater emphasis on stock options, a trend led by Jack Welch at GE. He constructed a system that ranked employees against each other and made bonuses a critical part of executive compensation. High stakes bonus pay became ubiquitous in corporate America and by 2015 accounted for 93% of the gender differences in executive compensation,

Triple Bind

One of the authors, Naomi Cahn, described the triple bind that results from the winner-take-all environment. She said there is a feedback loop that works like this:

“1. If women don’t compete on the same terms as men, they lose.

2. If women do compete on the same terms as men, they’re punished more harshly for their sharp elbows and misdeeds.

3. When women see the rules of the new game, they often don’t want to play on those terms.”

So women correctly feel like no matter how hard they try, the odds are still stacked against them.

Co-author June Carbone cited a study of financial advisors by Harvard economist Mark Egan and his co-authors. They found that female advisors were 20% more likely than male advisors to be fired for misconduct - and 30% less likely to find a new job in finance.

Is It Deja Vu All Over Again?

So are we in an era, as Yogi Berra famously said, that is “deja vu all over again”? It might be. While there is a lot of talk about the narrowing of the pay gap (e.g. World Economic Forum’s (WEF) 2023 Global Gender Gap Report noted parity in wage equality had increased in the US and Canada), it still exists. In fact, it increased again in the US for low-wage women, moving from 20.3% to 22.2% between 2019 and 2022, as cited by The Economic Policy Institute. Australia’s gender pay gap was 13.3% as of 2022, as noted in the National Strategy Gender Equality Discussion Paper. According to the Ministry of Social and Family Development in Singapore, as of 2023 the gender pay gap was 14.3%. And, as the AAUW states, despite the fact that over 50 years have passed since pay discrimination was made illegal, by 2022, women in the US still made only 84 cents to the dollar versus men.

Should We Care and What Can Be Done?

We should care, even if only for business reasons. Naomi Cahn notes that “the 10.4% of Fortune 500 CEOs who are female are substantially outperforming the men and that start-ups with female co-founders have weathered the tech winter better than others.”

Can anything be done? The authors’ perspective is that the situation is fixable, not by individual women, but by collective action, as well as by leadership activity. It focuses on systemic change, which can start with key leaders.

What can you do as a leader?

Ensure that you are reviewing pay parity (total comp, not just salaries) in your team and at your company-tips here.

Pay attention to whistleblower complaints - even if seemingly small, where there is smoke, there is usually fire.

Focus on transparency and effective communication, including pay transparency. (As co-author Nancy Levit told me, “Silence has never helped women.”)

Fix the “broken rungs” on your career ladders (McKinsey notes that for every 100 men promoted from entry level to manager only 87 women were promoted) which means women may start at the same level, but then fall behind and can’t catch up.

Clarify managers’ priorities around career development and equity, and reward results.

While governments and politicians have a lot to do to ensure gender pay equity, individual leaders play a key role in giving women a fair shake.","A series of five figures standing on stacks of coins, each representing a different profession, from left to right: a construction worker, a nurse, a businesswoman, an elderly woman, and a businessman.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x134 at 0x7D6BCB3011E0>,2024-05-29 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.forbes.com,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alizaknox/2024/05/29/shakedown-or-fair-shake-how-to-get-pay-equity-for-women/,['Opinion/Editorial' 'Politics'],[0.9 0.6],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/c08110bc5e.png
8adaf4c5d0,Newsweek,Archaeologists Reveal Ancient 'Moon' Pyramid's Astronomical Secrets - Newsweek,"Archaeologists have shed new light on the astronomical alignments of a spectacular ancient pyramid in Mexico during investigations conducted at the site of an iconic pre-Hispanic city. And Newsweek spoke with one of the archaeoastronomers on the project.

The monument in question, known as the Pyramid of the Moon, lies in the ancient Mesoamerican city of Teotihuacan, which is located about 30 miles NE of modern-day Mexico City.

While located close to the site of the former capital of the Aztec Empire, Teotihuacan predated this civilization by several centuries, seemingly reaching its peak during the first half of the 1st millennium B.C.—at which point it was the largest city in the Americas.

The archaeological site is renowned for many reasons, perhaps most notably for its two largest pyramid structures—the Pyramid of the Moon and the bigger Pyramid of the Sun. These monuments are considered to be among the most significant examples of such structures from the pre-Hispanic Americas.

The sun played a fundamental role in the worldview of ancient Mesoamerican peoples. Among other roles, the solstices and equinoxes functioned as markers that were used to determine the orientations of architectural structures, such as pyramids.

Previous archaeoastronomical research investigating the orientation of Teotihuacan's buildings has largely focused its attention on the Pyramid of the Sun, highlighting the significance of its astronomical alignments.

But some scholars, such as the researchers responsible for the latest investigations at Teotihuacan, take a slightly different view on the prominence of the Pyramid of the Sun. In part, this is because, despite its large size, the monument is located on one side of the Avenue of the Dead, unlike the Pyramid of the Moon, which takes up a privileged location at the end of the road. The Avenue of the Dead is a wide road that serves as the backbone of the city.

""It is thanks to the masterful design of this causeway that when you walk along it, the observer's vision is guided by the architectural landscape towards the Pyramid of the Moon,"" archaeoastronomer Aarón Uriel González Benítez of Mexico's National School of Anthropology and History (ENAH) told Newsweek.

With this in mind, a research team coordinated by Ismael Arturo Montero García of the University of Tepeyac, in collaboration with Benítez and other colleagues, decided to carry out an archaeoastronomical study. The aim was to demonstrate the significance of the vertices of the main monuments of Teotihuacan. A vertex (plural: vertices) is a point where two edges meet. The corners of a pyramid are vertices, for example.

Based on their findings, the researchers propose that the northeast and southwest vertices of the Pyramid of the Moon align ""exceptionally"" with the position of the sun in the sky at sunrise on the summer solstice and sunset on the winter solstice, respectively, as well as important points in the surrounding landscape.

For example, during the summer solstice, the longest day of the year, the sun rises at dawn over the Xihuingo volcano to the northeast when viewed from the top of the Pyramid of the Moon, while at dusk it sets behind the Maninal Hill to the west.

Meanwhile, the southwest vertex of the Pyramid points towards a hill called Chiconautla. As the sun sets on the winter solstice, it passes over Chiconautla before becoming obscured behind the southern slope of another prominent point, Moctezuma Peak, which lies almost directly behind the hill in a roughly similar line of sight (when observing from the Pyramid of the Moon).

Archaeological evidence shows that Chiconautla and the Xihuingo volcano were elevated points of great significance for the Teotihuacanos—with the latter functioning as a kind of astronomical observatory for the civilization. The Maninal Hill also dominates the landscape to the west of Teotihuacan, whose creators appear to have constructed the Pyramid of the Moon to mimic its form.

""When the documentary filmmaker Rafael Morales Orozco made a drone flight during the sunset of the summer solstice we realized that in a close-up we can see how the silhouette of the Pyramid of the Moon impressively resembles the relief of Maninal, the place where the sun sets on those solstitial days,"" Benítez said.

The researchers also uncovered other fascinating astronomical alignments during their research project. For example, the team found that, just as the northeast and southeast vertices of the Pyramids of the Moon display a strong association with the solstices, the northeast and southwest vertices of the Pyramid of the Sun ""amazingly"" align with the lunar standstills or ""lunistices"".

A lunar standstill is when the moon reaches its most northerly or southerly points during the course of a month. Essentially, they are the lunar equivalent of solstices.

Overall, the research indicates that the layout of Teotihuacan was astronomically determined by the sun, focused on the Xihuingo-Chiconautla axis, according to the researchers.

It also suggests that, contrary to popular belief, the astronomical identity of the Pyramid of the Moon appears to be more strongly influenced by the movements of the sun, while the Pyramid of the Sun seems to have a stronger association with the movements of the moon.

477e502b64,The Associated Press,Putin says Russia prefers Biden to Trump but criticizes current US policy - The Associated Press,"President Vladimir Putin said that Russia would prefer to see U.S. President Joe Biden win a second term, describing him as more experienced and predictable than Donald Trump — even though Moscow strongly disagrees with the current administration’s policies. Putin’s comments during an interview with Russian state television Wednesday were his first about the upcoming U.S. presidential election, likely to pit Biden against Trump. They were rare praise for Biden, a fierce critic of the Russian leader who has frequently lauded Trump. “Biden, he’s more experienced, more predictable, he’s a politician of the old formation,” Putin said, when asked which candidate would be better for Russia. “But we will work with any U.S. leader whom the American people trust.” Putin’s motives for saying Biden is a better choice for Russia were unclear, but the assertion was eyebrow-raising given prior U.S. government assessments of the Russian leader’s support for Trump and of Kremlin efforts to tip American elections in his favor. The apparent endorsement was not welcomed by the White House. Asked during a briefing on Thursday about Putin’s remarks, national security spokesman John Kirby responded, “I think Mr. Putin knows very well what this administration has been doing to counter Russia’s malign influence around the world.” “Mr. Putin should just stay out of our elections,” Kriby added. AP AUDIO: Putin says Russia prefers Biden to Trump, calling the US president more experienced and predictable. AP correspondent Karen Chammas reports on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s comments on his favorite for president of the U.S. Trump, by contrast, immediately hailed the statement at a campaign rally Wednesday night, calling it a “great compliment” to him. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Putin ordered a hidden campaign to influence the 2016 race in favor of Trump over Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton, with Russian operatives hacking Democratic emails and facilitating their release in the run-up to the election. More recently, intelligence agencies concluded that Putin had authorized influence operations in the 2020 election aimed at denigrating Biden, boosting Trump, undermining confidence in the vote and exacerbating social divisions in the U.S. Trump and Putin, who have frequently praised each other in the past, have dismissed such findings. Putin did also blast the White House’s policy toward Russia, describing it as “badly flawed and wrong.” The remarks come at time of heightened tension between Russia and the West — and deep disagreements in the U.S. about how best to counter Russia and help Ukraine. Putin has claimed that he sent troops into Ukraine to protect Russian speakers there and to prevent a threat to Russia’s security posed by Ukraine’s bid to join the NATO alliance. Ukraine and its Western allies have denounced Moscow’s action as an unprovoked act of aggression. Several NATO countries, chief among them the U.S. under Biden’s leadership, have sent Kyiv weapons and other military aid to fend off Russian forces. Trump, meanwhile, recently called into question U.S. funding for Ukraine and said he once warned he would allow Russia to do whatever it wants to NATO member nations that are “delinquent” in investing in their own defense. Those comments sent shock waves through Europe, where some leaders are preparing for a time when the U.S. does not play the pivotal role in NATO that it does now. Trump’s statement sharply contrasted with Biden’s pledge “to defend every inch of NATO territory.” Biden accused Trump on Tuesday of having “bowed down to a Russian dictator.” In the interview, Putin noted that Trumps’ view of relations with NATO’s allies is consistent with his approach during his presidency, even though the Europeans sharply disagree. The Russian leader described NATO as a “U.S. foreign policy tool,” adding that “if the U.S. thinks that it no longer needs this tool it’s up to it to decide.” Asked about speculation on Biden’s health issues, Putin responded that “I’m not a doctor and I don’t consider it proper to comment on that.” He added that Biden seemed in fine shape when the two leaders met in Switzerland in June 2021. Biden’s team has worked to alleviate Democratic concerns over alarms raised by a special counsel about Biden’s age and memory. They came in a report determining that Biden would not be charged with any criminal activity for possessing classified documents while a private citizen. Asked about his impressions from his last week’s interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Putin said he expected Carlson to be more aggressive. Putin used the interview to push his narrative on the fighting in Ukraine, urge Washington to recognize Moscow’s interests and press Kyiv to sit down for talks. Carlson didn’t ask Putin about war crimes Russian troops have been accused of in Ukraine, or about his relentless crackdown on dissent. “I expected him to be aggressive and ask the so-called tough questions, and I wasn’t only ready for it but wanted it because it would have given me a chance to respond sharply,” Putin said. ___ Associated Press writer Darlene Superville contributed from Washington.",A man in a suit and tie is speaking into a microphone with a blue background behind him.

712291ce87,Financial Times,The problem with auto-enrolled pensions - Financial Times,"Pension “auto enrolment” is seen as one of the UK’s big public policy success stories.

Since it was introduced in 2012, employers have been obliged to offer a pension and enrol all eligible staff unless they opt out. Some 9mn more people are now saving (mostly) modest amounts for their pension — the minimum employee contribution is 5 per cent, and 3 per cent for employers — with a low level of opt-out.

It looks like the perfect example of Nobel Prize-winner Richard Thaler’s “nudge theory” of behavioural economics, getting people to make the right decision, without compulsion.

But is auto enrolled pension saving really such a good thing for 20 per cent taxpayers — those earning up to £50,000 — who it was designed to help?

Rather than a “nudge”, auto enrolment is really a shove. If people choose to opt out, their overall salary goes down, because they lose the employer contribution. Not much of a choice?

And tax breaks — the only “magic” in pension saving, versus saving outside a pension in an Isa — certainly help 40 and 45 per cent taxpayers, earning over £50,000, but do precious little for 20 per cent taxpayers.

Although pension contributions are tax deductible, pensions in payment are taxed as income, so the only real freebie is the tax-free one-quarter cash lump sum. This reduces the retirement tax rate for 20 per cent taxpayers to 15 per cent — for every £80 after tax pension saving the tax gain is just £5, or 6 per cent of the amount saved.

Meanwhile, 40 per cent taxpayers do much better. For every £60 after tax pension savings, they gain £10, or 17 per cent of their saving. The real winners are those paying 40 per cent tax in work, but only 20 per cent in retirement. For every £60 after tax pension saving their gain is £25, a whopping 40 per cent of their saving.

But it’s a big leap of faith to believe the tax-free lump sum won’t be reduced, or scrapped altogether, over the next few decades.

And, anyway, it’s just a payment for locking up your money for 30 or 40 years, with no way to get your hands on it, if you need it. The economic cost of losing this flexibility is high, especially for lower earners with little or no ready savings.

For the many 20 per cent taxpayers who save into a pension, but also borrow to make ends meet, high interest rates on credit cards or borrowings completely overwhelm their tax benefit. Pension saving costs them real money.

What should happen?

It is standard practice for senior executives to be offered a higher salary for giving up the employer pension contribution (see the remuneration section of any glossy annual report).

This should be extended to all staff, not just the highest paid. Everyone should be able to take cash instead of a pension contribution — pitched to be cost neutral for the company.

Education should replace arm twisting. People can then make a real choice to save in a pension, an Isa — which doesn’t lock-up their money for decades — or avoiding taking on debt, or simply spend it.

The government should move to a flat rate of tax relief for all pension savers at, say, 30 per cent

A few companies already offer higher pay and no pension contribution — the accountancy firm Deloitte introduced this in 2022, and United Learning, running academy schools, is introducing something along similar lines.

What about tax?

There are rumblings that chancellor Rachel Reeves could use the autumn Budget to raise money by reducing the tax break for 40 per cent taxpayers. This would be a mistake.

Pension tax should be changed, not to raise money, but to encourage 20 per cent taxpayers to save for a half-decent retirement.

The new Labour government should move to a flat rate of tax relief for all pension savers — which Reeves backed in 2016 — set to be neutral for the Treasury at, say, 30 per cent.

A flat rate is fundamentally fair — everyone gets the same tax top-up for each pension pound saved. It is also efficient, encouraging the lower paid to save more for their retirement, and helps close the gender pension gap, which sees men, on average, receive much higher pension income than women.

A flat rate also cuts through the complex rules for the very highest earners — especially NHS consultants. The annual allowance cap could be scrapped, and we could forget about reinstating the lifetime allowance.

Higher earners would simply choose to save as much as they wanted in their pension, taking their less generous tax break into account.

And despite the objections of some experts, the practical mechanics of a flat rate are easy. Pension contributions would include both employer and employee contributions, to avoid “gaming” the system, for example offering higher employer contributions in exchange for a lower salary.

For defined benefit pensions — almost exclusively public sector these days — the value of the annual contribution would be the pension earned in any year multiplied by a “factor” set by the Treasury, just like today. Individual tax codes would be tweaked up or down, so all taxpayers got the correct flat-rate top up.

The new Labour government can make a real change to the retirement of millions of people. It should ignore the howls of protest from 40 and 45 per cent taxpayers, and the pensions industry lobby, and introduce both an AE cash option, and flat rate tax top up.","People are silhouetted against a backdrop of modern buildings, suggesting a busy urban environment.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA1B385E0>,2024-08-08 04:00:55.083000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/1c54192f-fa81-4d88-85df-64f2c04c2dcb,['Business and Finance' 'Politics'],[0.9  0.85],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/712291ce87.png
05c00395af,CNN,"July 20, 2024, presidential campaign news - CNN","Pelosi stresses importance of upcoming election but avoids discussing Biden uncertainty

While she took the stage to Bonnie Raitt’s “Something to Talk About” at the North Carolina Democratic Party’s Unity Dinner on Saturday night, former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi didn’t really touch on the topic that’s had everyone talking about her the past few weeks.

Pelosi stressed the importance of November’s election as she addressed about 900 North Carolina Democrats, but she didn’t remark on the uncertainty at the top of the ticket — or the role sources have told CNN she played in a slew of statements from lawmakers calling for President Joe Biden to step aside. Instead, she focused on policy ideas and down-ballot candidates in the crucial battleground state.

Sources told CNN this week that Pelosi told Biden in a private call that polling shows he cannot defeat Donald Trump, and that he could destroy Democrats’ chances of winning the House in November if he continues seeking a second term. Biden responded with defensiveness, according to two of the sources.

As she left the event Saturday, Pelosi didn’t answer questions on whether she believes Biden should step aside or whether she’s spoken with him or Vice President Kamala Harris in the past few days.

During her speech, Pelosi didn’t speak much about the Biden-Harris campaign, though she praised the accomplishments of the administration and contrasted its agenda with that of Republicans under Trump, whom she referred to as “What’s His Name” throughout the speech.

However, Pelosi also noted that the election is about the future and not the past.

Democratic Rep. Brendan Boyle calls on Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle to resign

Rep. Brendan Boyle, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, on Saturday became one of the latest voices to call on US Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle to step down immediately after the attempt to assassinate former President Donald Trump.

The Secret Service is facing a flurry of questions about how a gunman was able to get a clear line of sight to Trump at the site of his rally in Pennsylvania, and there have been calls for Cheatle’s resignation from some members of Congress, including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Speaker Mike Johnson.

His call follows a stunning scene this week at the Republican National Convention, where a group of GOP senators chased Cheatle through the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee and denounced her refusal to answer questions regarding the assassination attempt.

That confrontation came after Trump met with the Secret Service director to receive a private, in-person briefing about the attempted assassination, a source familiar with the meeting said earlier.

Cheatle told CNN in an interview this week that the Secret Service was “solely responsible for the design and implementation and the execution of the site.”

Cheatle will testify Monday before the House Committee on Oversight, which is investigating the assassination attempt.

“I took a bullet for democracy,"" Trump says at his first rally since shooting

Former President Donald Trump on Saturday held his first campaign rally since surviving last week’s attempted assassination attempt, telling a large crowd gathered in a Michigan arena that he “took a bullet for democracy.”

Trump, who spoke for nearly two hours, thanked the staff at Butler Memorial Hospital, where he was taken minutes after the shooting at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.

Trump called Corey Comperatore, who was shot and killed during the assassination attempt, a “hero,” and also spoke of the two rallygoers who were injured, David Dutch and James Copenhaver. The crowd cheered “Corey!”

Trump said he spoke to tech billionaire Elon Musk before coming to the Grand Rapids rally. The former president said Musk didn’t mention reporting from The Wall Street Journal that he will be committing around $45 million a month to a pro-Trump super PAC.

Trump praised the organizers of the GOP convention this past week in Milwaukee and called the city a “fantastic place.”

The former president at one point looked at one of the screens in the arena where video of his speech was being displayed.

He stopped his speech, pointed to his hair and said, “That’s very severe, that comb-over.”

GOP Senate candidate in Michigan drops out and endorses Trump-backed candidate as Trump calls for unity

Sandy Pensler, a Republican candidate for Michigan’s open US Senate seat, dropped out of the GOP primary race on Saturday and backed Trump-endorsed candidate Mike Rogers amid a push for unity within the party.

Former President Donald Trump called both men onto the stage at his first post-assassination attempt campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, teasing that Pensler “has just announced that he would like to do something very important today.”

Pensler and Rogers, a former US congressman from Michigan, walked onto stage and joined hands, raising them in the air.

Just weeks ahead of Michigan’s August 6 Senate primary, Pensler argued a “divisive continued primary” hurts the chances of the GOP regaining control of the Senate, and said he would do the “right thing” and end his candidacy.

“President Trump endorsed Mike Rogers. Tonight, so am I,” he said.

Trump backed Rogers, who had previously been critical of his influence on the party, in March.

After Pensler and Rogers left the stage, Trump remarked they were “unifying the party, and that was beautiful to watch.” The former president and his allies have taken up a message of unity after a failed assassination attempt on Trump in Pennsylvania last week.

Biden briefed on domestic issues, including ongoing investigations, White House says

President Joe Biden was briefed Saturday by two of his senior aides on domestic issues including the economy and homeland security in a virtual meeting, a White House official said.

Jeff Zients, Biden’s chief of staff, “provided a briefing on issues of domestic importance, including the state of the economy,” a White House official said. Liz Sherwood-Randall, the president’s homeland security adviser, “provided a briefing on issues of homeland security, including ongoing investigations,” the official added.

Biden remains at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home while he isolates with Covid-19.

Earlier Saturday, the president’s physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, said in a letter that Biden’s symptoms “continue to improve steadily.”

Harris' Massachusetts fundraiser raises more than $2 million, organizers say

Vice President Kamala Harris raised more than $2 million at a fundraiser in Provincetown, Massachusetts, on Saturday, according to organizers of the event.

Harris got one of her most roaring responses in years at the fundraiser, which came as some big-dollar donors have held back from writing checks for the campaign amid growing concerns about President Joe Biden’s candidacy. Democratic donor hesitation has raised serious concerns about how long the campaign can continue operating in full force if circumstances don’t change.

The vice president didn’t directly address the turmoil facing her running mate — referring to him at points as “our president” and “one of the most consequential presidents in American history” — but she did speak to the anxiety pulsing through that white tent in the shadow of the Pilgrim Monument by repeating, “We are going to win this election,” and asking the crowd to tell that to their friends.

The event was scheduled weeks ago, in very different political circumstances. By the time she took the stage, Harris was greeted with the excitement of many in the crowd who clearly believed they might be looking at a replacement nominee.

Harris wasn’t the only one to get a warm reception. Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary and speculated by some leading Democrats as a potential running mate should Harris take over as the nominee, spoke ahead of her, likewise standing by Biden and touting his accomplishments.

CNN had previously reported that actors Jennifer Coolidge and Adrienne Warren were also appearing at the campaign fundraiser.

Man arrested after being accused of writing social media threats to kill Trump and Vance

A Florida man was arrested Friday after making threats on social media toward former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, a Jupiter Police Department news release said.

The man, Michael Martin Wiseman, was also accused of threatening Trump’s and Vance’s families with bodily harm, according to Jupiter police.

The police were alerted to the “multiple” threats made by Wiseman by residents “who expressed their concern in person” and through online crime tips, the news release said.

Wiseman was taken into police custody without incident Friday after multiple law enforcement agencies investigated the tips and Wiseman’s Facebook account, according to the news release.

The investigation was conducted by Jupiter police in coordination with the US Secret Service and the Palm Beach County state attorney’s office, officials noted.

Wiseman was charged with writing threats to kill or injure and had his first court appearance Saturday morning, according to Palm Beach County online court records. His next court date is August 19. His attorney, Tama Kudman, would not comment on the case when reached by phone Saturday.

Wiseman is being held without bond in the Palm Beach County Main Detention Center, according to online records from the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office.

“We cannot fulfill our mission without the help of our state and local police partners and we’d like to thank the Jupiter Police Department for their partnership and collaboration with this investigation,” Anthony Guglielmi, chief of communications for the US Secret Service, said in a statement Saturday.

CNN has reached out to the Trump-Vance campaign regarding Wiseman’s arrest.

Trump wears smaller, beige-colored bandage on his ear at first rally after assassination attempt

Former President Donald Trump stepped onstage wearing a smaller, beige-colored bandage on his ear at tonight’s rally in Michigan — the first he’s attended since surviving an assassination attempt a week ago in Pennsylvania.

Trump wore a larger, white bandage on his ear during the Republican National Convention all week in Milwaukee, which spawned imitators in the crowd.

Rep. Ronny Jackson, the former White House physician who has been caring for Trump since the shooting, said in an update Saturday that the former president is “doing well” and “recovering as expected” after suffering a gunshot wound to his ear.

Trump rally attendees wear shirts featuring assassination attempt imagery

Imagery from the assassination attempt on Donald Trump is prevalent at the former president’s first campaign rally since the shooting one week ago in Pennsylvania.

Many supporters are wearing shirts featuring the image of Trump holding his fist in the air and telling his voters to “fight” as Secret Service agents rushed him from the stage.

Many of the merchandise tables outside the venue in Grand Rapids, Michigan, were selling shirts to attendees as they waited in long lines to funnel into the indoor arena.

“Fight, fight, fight,” has become a new rallying cry for Republicans in the wake of the assassination attempt.

Trump is speaking now, after his newly selected running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, introduced the former president for the first time at an official Trump-Vance rally.

This post has been updated with new images and to reflect that Trump has started speaking.

Top Trump adviser slams right-wing criticism of the women working on Trump’s Secret Service detail

Chris LaCivita, a top adviser to Donald Trump, slammed the right-wing criticism of the women working on the former president’s security detail during last week’s assassination attempt in Pennsylvania.

CNN asked him what he thought of the criticism, including comments made by Florida GOP Rep. Cory Mills on Fox News in which he said, “Look, I’m not sure about who the individuals are on the individual detail, Secret Service, but I can tell you under this Biden administration, the one thing I’ve seen is massive DEI hires,” referring to diversity, equity and inclusion.

“I saw two women — one of them with a gun in her hand and the other with her body around him — that’s pretty f**king bada** where I come from,” LaCivita said.

LaCivita also said the Trump campaign was ready should President Joe Biden decide to end his 2024 campaign.

“As many scenarios as they could dream up, we’re ready,” LaCivita said.

LaCivita was asked whether Trump was receiving any kind of counseling or professional mental health care.

“Donald Trump? Are you kidding me? No,” LaCivita said.

Trump takes the stage

Former President Donald Trump has taken the stage in Grand Rapids, Michigan, marking his first campaign rally appearance since the attempt to assassinate him last weekend.

Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, returned to the stage to introduce the former president after speaking at the rally earlier. Vance praised Trump’s four years in office and criticized President Joe Biden’s record in his introduction.

“You’re going to make a fantastic vice president,” Trump told his VP pick, adding that he chose Vance because he’s “for the worker.”

The former president and Vance greeted each other, as the crowd cheered loudly, before Vance walked off and Trump began his speech.

Trump is now speaking.

Clintons privately urge donors to keep giving to Biden as long as he remains presumptive nominee

Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have been privately encouraging donors in recent weeks to continue financially supporting President Joe Biden’s campaign, according to two sources familiar, in the aftermath of his disastrous debate performance that sent the Democratic Party spiraling into chaos.

One of the sources said the Clintons are choosing to be “deferential to Biden’s decision.” However, the second source, who is familiar with the Clintons’ thinking and has spoken with the couple in recent days, insisted it is more accurate to say they are “deferential to the process.”

According to this source, the Clintons have made clear in private conversations recently that it doesn’t matter what anybody says or thinks — unless Biden drops out of the 2024 race or the delegates vote for somebody else, he is the party’s presumptive nominee.

This source declined to comment on whether the Clintons have expressed a personal view on whether they believe Biden should continue seeking a second term.

Since the CNN debate on June 27, big-dollar donors have held back from writing checks amid growing concerns about Biden’s candidacy, raising serious concerns about how long the campaign can continue operating in full force if circumstances don’t change.

“I don’t know how you campaign with a broadening electoral map without money. I don’t know what they’re doing. I don’t know,” one major Democratic donor told CNN on Friday. “I’ve never seen this strategy where you think you can win without money.”

This donor mused that perhaps the campaign can get away with digging in for a few more weeks under the current circumstances, but that anything longer would become extraordinarily difficult.","Two men in suits, one with a red tie and the other with a blue tie, are standing in front of a microphone, with a crowd in the background.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BCBFA0A60>,2024-07-20 12:35:45.075000+00:00,https://www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/biden-trump-election-07-20-24/index.html,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/05c00395af.png
6f71f816aa,The New York Times,The Business Ties That Bind the U.S. and China Are Strong but Fraying - The New York Times,"If you follow the news, you know that tensions between the United States and China are high and that the commercial relationship between the two biggest trading nations on the planet has been fraying.

Yet, amid the ominous headlines about a possible “decoupling” of the United States and China, you may be surprised by how strong and binding their financial ties remain.

Many big U.S. companies depend on China for a substantial part of their income and rely on Chinese suppliers and factories for their products. The two economies are closely linked, and, as an old China hand, I think that’s a good thing. It implies that even if relations deteriorate further, the countries have many incentives for pulling back from the brink of serious conflict.

Consider that while the publicly traded U.S. companies in the S&P 500 obtain almost 60 percent of their revenue domestically, the biggest source of their foreign sales is China. That’s according to estimates from the financial data company FactSet, which said sales from China amounted to 7.1 percent of S&P 500 revenues for the 12 months through December. The second-largest foreign source was Japan, with 2.6 percent; followed by Germany and Britain, with 2.2 percent each; and then Taiwan, with 1.8 percent.

Numbers like these are critical in assessing U.S.-China relations, Dale Copeland, a political scientist at the University of Virginia, said in an interview. “Expectations of future profits are a key and often neglected factor in international relations,” he said. Mr. Copeland is the author of “A World Safe for Commerce: American Foreign Policy From the Revolution to the Rise of China.”

“History shows that when a major power cuts off business and resources abruptly — so that prospects for future commerce look dim — the possibility of war becomes much greater,” he added. “Fortunately, that hasn’t happened so far with the United States and China. Greater conflict, even war — aren’t inevitable. There are still plenty of opportunities for future business and, I think, that is, and should be, a deliberate part of current U.S. policy.”

The Case Against China

Corporate earnings provide only one perspective on a complex issue. But they are eye-opening because they seem to fly in the face of the drumroll of conflicts and restrictions between the United States and China.

From tariffs to technology bans to concerns about TikTok, the Biden administration has been cracking down on China, which, it says, is abusing longstanding commercial relationships, subsidizing local industries directly and indirectly, obtaining U.S. intellectual property illicitly and fundamentally threatening U.S. national security. U.S. intelligence estimated that China had “the capability to directly compete with the United States and U.S. allies” and, if unopposed, could “alter the rules-based global order” in its favor.

It’s an election year in the United States and the country’s new China policies build on a shift that began during the Trump administration. Donald J. Trump’s advisers now say that if he is re-elected, he will aim for a full “decoupling” from China, though he has been inconsistent: He recently questioned the need to require the Chinese owners of TikTok to sell the app or shut it down in the United States, but as president, he tried to force a sale.

China’s reaction to recent U.S. measures has been muted. But some further response is more likely if the United States keeps pushing for an allied commercial front that aims to prevent Chinese factories from exporting torrents of low-cost goods like electric vehicles, solar panels and steel that could hurt local industries and cause domestic dislocations in many countries.

Porous Barriers

The steepest targeted tariffs — like the new 100 percent tariff on Chinese electric vehicles — are on goods that aren’t being imported in large volumes into the United States. That means that President Biden’s new tariffs wouldn’t change the overall picture much, an analysis by Oxford Economics, an independent research firm, suggested.

The trade-weighted average U.S. tariff on goods from all nations was just “1.6 percent before the Trump trade wars and it rose to as much as 3.1 percent,” Ryan Sweet, the chief U.S. economist at the firm, said in an email. Before Mr. Biden’s latest tariffs, the average U.S. tariff was 2.7 percent, he said, and the new tariffs would “permanently add 0.14 percent to the effective tariff rate.”

But the effective tariff will drop below 2.3 percent over the next decade, he projected, as businesses figure out ways of avoiding “the Trump/Biden tariff hikes.” That assumes the tariff wars don’t worsen.

To put that into perspective, the World Bank calculated that the worldwide average tariff was 2.6 percent in 2017, before the U.S.-China conflict began. So the United States is still not a global outlier, even if it is no longer reducing trade barriers and lowering costs for consumers. At this point, as U.S. corporate earnings reports show, there are still vast opportunities for profitable commerce between the two countries.

The Chip Wars

What I find striking is that even companies that design, manufacture and create tools for advanced silicon chips continue to receive substantial revenues from China.

Recall that in 2022, the United States began to impose export controls on such companies from countries that used U.S. technology, restricting their sales to China. At the same time, with the Chips Act, the United States began subsidizing construction of domestic semiconductor foundries, effectively replicating parallel efforts that China had begun earlier.

I spoke with Chris Miller, a historian at the Fletcher School at Tufts University who wrote “Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology.”

U.S. restrictions are calibrated so that even some advanced chips are being shipped to China, he said. “It’s the chips that are critical for A.I. that the U.S. is really targeting. Others are getting through.”

Nvidia, the foremost designer of the chips that make artificial intelligence possible, is prohibited from shipping its most advanced products to China. That has dented its business there. Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia, said in an earnings call this past week that Nvidia’s business in China had declined “because of the limitations on our technology.” For 2023, FactSet estimated that China was Nvidia’s third-biggest market, with 16.6 percent of its total sales, behind only the United States, with 44.3 percent, and Taiwan, with 22 percent.

In fact, all of the semiconductor companies I looked at — Nvidia, Broadcom, AMD, Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor, Samsung, Lam Research, KLA and Tokyo Electronics — received substantial revenue from China in 2023. China was among the companies’ top three markets, and, in most cases, ranked No. 1. Intel, for example, received 26.8 percent of its revenue from China.

The case of ASML, a Dutch company, is instructive. The company makes lithography machines that are needed to etch circuits for the smallest and most cutting-edge chips. Roger Dassen, the company’s chief financial officer, said in an earnings call in April that the U.S. ban could eliminate 10 to 15 percent of its China sales.

Nonetheless, he said, “We’re still looking at a strong sales level for China for this year.” FactSet estimated that ASML received 25.8 percent of its revenues from China in 2023. Revenue from the United States was only 11.4 percent.

Consider Apple. It’s not just that China accounted for 17.8 percent of the company’s revenue in 2023, second only to the United States. It’s that Apple routinely ships large quantities of tiny, advanced, state-of-the-art semiconductors in and out of China. “The regulations were written to allow this to happen,” Mr. Miller said.

The iPhone 15 in my pocket contains a four-nanometer chip designed by Apple in California, made in Taiwan, shipped to China for assembly and then shipped back to consumers like me in New York. The iPhone 15 Pro already uses three-nanometer chips, and Apple is preparing to incorporate even more advanced two-nanometer chips from Taiwan Semiconductor. All this technology is beyond China’s commercial capability. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.","An illustration of two hands shaking, one with a U.S. flag and the other with a Chinese flag, set against a blue background with white stars.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x117 at 0x7D6BA13E6380>,2024-05-24 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/24/business/united-states-china-chips-profits.html,['International' 'Business and Finance'],[0.9  0.85],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/6f71f816aa.png
d235769c06,BBC.com,Medway voters tell us what their priorities are for the election - BBC.com,"Stark election issues at stake for Medway's voters

17 June 2024

Charlotte Wright

Political Editor, BBC South East

With less than two weeks to go before polling day on 4 July, voters in Medway have been explaining what matters most to them in the general election.

Tucked away in an alley off a bustling high street in Chatham is an oasis and a sanctuary. Follow a path lined with tropical plants and you will find the Nucleus Arts Centre.

It is here the community comes together, whether for a coffee in the café, a carers’ support group, or artists in the dozens of tiny studios available to rent.

Local painter Sophie, who spends much of her day here creating bright and vivid paintings of wildlife and nature, offers a hefty dose of realism: “It’s just very difficult at the moment -the cost of living is so high and people are just struggling.”

While her work is joyful, she recognises a sense of ""depression"" as well

""I think that’s the worst thing really. It’s a bad feeling,"" she said. “A lot of people have almost given up on politicians.”

Around the corner, Carol Smith was glazing pottery. She agreed times are tough, and it is not just the cost of living.

“We’re having a lot of new building in Medway, but there’s not a lot of new doctors, dentists, things that go with more people living here.”

Everyone is worrying, she told me.

While Medway is said to have some of the most deprived wards in the UK, it is also a cultural hub, with a carnival, an annual Pride event and a diverse range of arts, filmmaking and music on offer.

David Stokes, chief executive of the Halpern Charitable Foundation, which runs the Nucleus Arts Centre, said groups like theirs can make a huge difference to wellbeing.

He is calling on the next government to prioritise funding for arts and services to help support the local community.

Dr Stokes said: “By building community it overcomes those problems.

""If you look at deprivation across the world, some of the most deprived countries are some of the happiest countries because the community works. That’s where you feel secure… it’s being part of something else.”

The high street reflects the impact that the cost of living crisis is having.

Dalip Singh, who has run a shop in Chatham for 20 years, said has business has struggled as people have less spare cash to spend.

“Obviously the government’s trying to do a job”, he said. “No one asked for Covid, no one asked for a war, no one asked for gas prices to go up, but they have.

""No matter what government we have, the problems are going to be there.”

Much like the different towns that make up Medway, the challenges the area faces are diverse.

Mother-of-five Rebecca Leek moved to Strood from Gillingham after her son was stabbed in broad daylight in a park last year.

He survived and is doing well now, but for Rebecca tougher sentences for those caught carrying knives is a priority.

She said: “I just think there should be a better punishment for them; not just a slap on the wrist and go on your merry way.”

While times are clearly tough for many, there is plenty of community spirit in Medway.

In Rainham, we found a micro pub full of residents who were enjoying a beer on a Friday after work.

Getting on the housing ladder, potholes and lack of money for public services dominated the conversation when we asked them about the upcoming election.

Chris Jenner told us he would be happy to pay higher taxes to fund these things: “If I have to pay more tax but the service I get - and everybody gets - is better, what’s the problem with that?”

Asked about the impact of that for those struggling with the cost of living, he said: “If you want services - the NHS, rubbish collected, the roads to be a good condition - you have to pay for it.”

At another table, German national Martin Kühn, who has lived in Medway for 34 years, said his main concern is Brexit, a topic largely avoided by all the main political parties this year.

“It’s unfortunate that Labour doesn’t make this an issue because it has damaged this country hugely,” he said.

His wife, Erika Kulig, had a stark message for politicians: “When we first came here it was a really thriving area. Now we haven’t got SureStart anymore.

""I used to be a midwife and you can see on the ground level how poor people are.

“So I would say to the politicians, 'Wake up, give the people what they need'.

""They need support sympathy and a bit more money in their pockets as well.”

A full list of candidates in the three Medway seats can be found here.

bae3ffba57,Newsmax,Texts Show Shooter ID'd Early at Trump Rally - Newsmax,"Newly revealed text messages show that shooter Thomas Crooks aroused police suspicion more than an hour and a half before former President Donald Trump even took the stage at a campaign rally at Butler, Pennsylvania.

The texts conflict with the 60 minutes talked about in congressional hearings, The New York Times reported Monday.

A law enforcement after-action report, along with the texts from Beaver County Emergency Services was provided to the newspaper by the office of Iowa's Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley.

In one message 97 minutes before Trump took the stage, a local countersniper who was ending his shift, texted his colleagues about a man outside the fenced area of the rally, saying the person would have seen him come out with his rifle and ""knows you guys are up there.""

The messages also showed that the officers said 25 minutes before Trump took the stage and 33 minutes before the shooting that they should inform the Secret Service that a ""kid learning around building we are in. ... I did see him with a range finder looking towards stage. FYI. If you wanna notify SS snipers to look out. I lost sight of him.""

The messages also add to the evidence that Crooks was often one step ahead of the Secret Service.

For example, Crooks scoped out the rally site a day before the Secret Service did and used a drone to survey the site the day of the rally while the Secret Service didn't seek permission to use one.

Crooks also researched how far Lee Harvey Oswald was from John F. Kennedy when he fatally shot the president in 1963 (265 feet) and managed to climb onto a roof that was 400 feet from Trump at its closest point.

Meanwhile, the Secret Service left that roof unmanned.

In addition, although countersnipers were assigned to watch the rally, Crooks was in a position to watch them.

The texts and footage, along with interviews by the the Times and public testimony by investigators, have also filled in much of what Crooks did in the days before the rally.

Crooks started searching online for information on famous people, including FBI Director Christopher Wray, Attorney General Merrick Garland, President Joe Biden and Trump, as well as looking up ""major depressive disorder.""

Crooks narrowed his focus to the former president and to past assassinations after Trump’s campaign announced the rally in Butler 10 days prior. Three days later, Crooks ""did a Google search for 'How far away was Oswald from Kennedy?'"" Wray told a congressional committee last week.","An older man with a raised fist is shown against a clear blue sky, likely at a political rally.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x187 at 0x7D6BCB90D900>,2024-07-29 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.newsmax.com,https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/assassination-trump-crooks/2024/07/29/id/1174375/,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.9 ],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/bae3ffba57.png
15ae4058b4,Fox News,"Science mag touts Harris bringing science experience to White House because of her mom’s career, gets trashed - Fox News","The outlet Scientific American became the subject of mockery on social media for publishing a piece saying that Vice President Kamala Harris will bring a scientific perspective to the presidency if she wins because her mom was a cancer researcher.

The piece went viral on X with conservatives and other critics of the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee ridiculing the claim.

The headline of the article read: ""What a Kamala Harris Presidency Would Mean for Science."" The subhead added: ""As the daughter of a cancer researcher, Kamala Harris would bring a lifelong familiarity with science to the presidency, experts say.""

""This is awesome news. My Dad was in the Air Force, so I guess I’m a veteran now,"" conservative commentator Charles Cooke posted on Friday.

HARRIS' BACKING OF BAIL FUND DURING GEORGE FLOYD PROTESTS DAMPENS TRUMP ‘PROSECUTOR’ CAMPAIGN PITCH

The outlet published the piece earlier in the week, arguing that Harris will bring some experience with science to the White House because ""her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, who Harris cites as a major influence, was a leading breast-cancer researcher who died of cancer.""

As evidence that Harris is already highly invested in the sciences, Scientific American detailed how the politician promoted diversity initiatives in the scientific fields throughout her career.

""As senator, Harris co-sponsored efforts to improve the diversity of the science, technology, engineering and medicine (STEM) workforce. She introduced legislation to aid students from underrepresented populations to obtain jobs and work experience in STEM fields.""

The piece, by Max Kozlov, Mariana Lenharo, Jeff Tollefson & nature magazine, added, ""As vice-president, Harris has overseen the National Space Council, which is charged with advising the president on US space policy and strategy. Under Harris’s leadership, the body has focused on international cooperation, for example on the Artemis mission, which aims to send astronauts to the Moon.""

One of the most well-known contributions of Harris to the field of astronomy and space exploration was a widely-mocked video of her talking to children about the cosmos in 2021.

In the viral video, which was meant to encourage kids’ enthusiasm for space, Harris gushed to child actors about the topic, saying things like, ""You’re gonna literally see the craters on the moon with your own eyes!"" and ""I just love the idea of exploring the unknown.""

BLUE CITY COPS SAY KAMALA HARRIS ‘HELPED’ KILLERS AND RAPISTS, WARN OF ‘DISASTER’ IF SHE BECOMES PRESIDENT

At the time, critics blasted her for coming off as ""fake"" and ""cringe."" Donald Trump Jr. commented on the clip, posting, ""Her commitment to cringe is truly impressive.""

Scientific American’s piece on Harris’ science background inspired similar mockery on X this week.

Gov. Ron DeSatnis, R-Fla., comms person Christina Pushaw mocked the piece, writing, ""’your parents' education and careers are passed along to you in the bloodstream’ - The Science.""

Indie journalist Christina Buttons lamented, ""I’m embarrassed that I ever used to subscribe to this magazine.""

Author Jennifer Sey slammed the outlet, posting, ""I’m the daughter of a pediatrician. No one seemed to care about that when I argued that children were being harmed by Covid restrictions. Nor should they have. My dad’s expertise had nothing to do with my own common sense views on what would happen to kids from severe isolation.""

GOP comms person Matt Whitlock countered the outlet’s piece with Harris’ ""cringe"" space video, stating, ""We already saw Kamala Harris’s ‘lifelong familiarity with science’ on full display when they hired child actors to talk to her about space.""

Conservative commentator Jonah Goldberg asked, ""Hey @sciam, what do you make of Trump’s claims that he understands science because his uncle was a physicist at MIT?""

Ophthalmologist & PhD research scientist Dr. David Hemmati commented, ""A perplexing puff piece by Scientific American claiming that because her mom researched cancer, Kamala Harris would ‘bring a lifelong familiarity with science to the presidency.’ This high produced NASA video with paid child actors (& many others) would say otherwise.""

He added, ""This magazine loses a lot of credibility for making this claim.

a1f96cb3e2,Financial Times,Chess: Firouzja wins in St Louis as world champion Ding fails again - Financial Times,"Alireza Firouzja, the Iranian-born Frenchman, is a renewed talent after the 21-year-old won first prize unbeaten in last week’s $350,000 Sinquefield Cup at St Louis. Firouzja scored 6/9, edging out the US champion and world No 3, Fabiano Caruana, by half a point.

The iconic event, named after Rex Sinquefield, the FT reader who has become America’s most generous chess benefactor in history, is one of the game’s three elite annual super-tournaments, along with Tata Steel Wijk aan Zee and Norway Chess in Stavanger.

Two years ago, Firouzja seemed headed for the absolute top. He was the youngest ever to reach a 2800 rating and was favourite for the Candidates. Magnus Carlsen had implicitly named him as the heir apparent.

Then it all went wrong. Firouzja failed badly at the 2022 and 2024 Candidates, fell out with the Wijk aan Zee organisers, played all-night one-minute bullet games in the middle of a major tournament, announced that he was cutting down on chess in favour of an alternative career in fashion design, and saw a drop in his world ranking from second to 16th. He appeared to have lost his motivation to succeed.

In the past few months Firouzja has made significant changes to his lifestyle. He is more relaxed with interviewers and opponents, has replaced the high-fashion purple shirts with sober black suits, cut back substantially on blitz and bullet games, and has arrived at the board with well-prepared openings. His ranking has jumped back up to world No 5.

Caruana and Firouzja met in round one, when the former could have drawn by 80 Rd5! but overpressed. That result ultimately proved the tournament decider, with Caruana’s later efforts to catch up just falling short.

The US champion’s best moment came when he defeated his old rival Ian Nepomniachtchi, whose Dragon Sicilian blunder 18 g5? allowed the winning counter 18....Nxe4!.

The Sinquefield Cup proved another failure for China’s world champion, Ding Liren. The troubled title holder drew his first six games from level or favourable positions, then tailed off with two defeats in the final three rounds. One of them was to Firouzja, who explained later that he had kept the position complex in the correct belief that Ding would falter in time pressure.

Ding has scored below 50 per cent at his last five classical tournaments, the worst run for any reigning world champion since 1886. He has stated that he was recovering from an episode of depression, for which he was twice treated in a clinic. Unlike other world champions, Ding has low public recognition in his own country, where Go and Xiangqi are far more popular than international chess.

Meanwhile his challenger, India’s Gukesh Dommaraju, who at age 18 will become the youngest ever world champion if he wins their 14-game, $2.5mn title match in Singapore in November-December, drew all his nine Sinquefield Cup games. Gukesh still made a favourable impression as he was ready for long battles, strong in defence, and was close to winning a strategic masterpiece against Firouzja until he missed the decisive 47 Kg2! followed by Rxa6 when White should win with four pawns for the exchange.

When Gukesh became the challenger five months ago, he was even money to win the crown. Now his odds have shortened to 1-2 on, while Ding is the 6-4 against outsider.

This weekend on September 6-8, Paris will host the semi-finals and final of the $175,000 chess.com speed championship, whose earlier rounds were played online but whose last stages will be hybrid, with the players seated opposite each other but playing on separate computers. Each match will involve three hours of play at time rates ranging from five-minute blitz to one-minute bullet.

One semi-final is Carlsen v Hans Niemann, their first over the board encounter since their infamous 2022 Sinquefield Cup game which sparked cheating allegations and a $100mn lawsuit; the other is Firouzja v world No2 and celebrated streamer Hikaru Nakamura.

That match is too close to call, and the likely Carlsen v Firouzja or Nakamura final also has scope for an upset result. The time limit is very fast, yet this will be a high-standard event, albeit with the occasional blunder, which should fascinate its online audience.

England has both of the world’s top two under-10 chess players, according to the September 2024 ranking list just issued by Fide, the global chess body.

Nine-year-olds Ethan Pang and Bodhana Sivanandan both competed in the recent adult British Championship. Pang, who holds the world record for the youngest ever 2200-rated player, with a peak of 2266 achieved in August, has been playing in a tournament at Budapest where he defeated three low-rated grandmasters and narrowly missed what would have been a new world age record for a 2300 rating.

Sivanandan, the world’s highest rated under-13 girl, will become England’s youngest player in any game or sport at the 197-nation Budapest Olympiad which starts on September 10. England’s open team of five players is seeded eighth, and England women 13th.

Average savings account rates haven’t budged over the past week, as banks try to figure out if the Federal Reserve’s pause in interest rate hikes is permanent.

More broadly, this propitious development for savers presents a prime opportunity to fortify your emergency fund or work towards a big ticket purchase. Whatever your motivation, aim for a savings account with a high interest rate, low fees and outstanding customer service, in addition to a user-friendly digital experience.

SAVINGS RATES TODAY

Average APY

5.84%

$10,000 minimum deposit

0.24%

5.35%

Savings accounts provided minuscule yields following the Great Recession thanks to the Fed keeping borrowing costs low in order to cajole economic growth.

This low-rate environment was abandoned, however, following the government’s extensive spending during the pandemic, which caused the Fed to significantly boost interest rates to offset soaring inflation. That then prompted banks and credit unions to raise rates for savers.

Savings account rates — $2,500 minimum deposit

The highest interest rate on a standard savings account today is 5.84%, per Curinos, the same as a week ago. Meanwhile, the average APY (annual percentage yield) for a traditional savings account, as reported by Curinos, is 0.24%, up slightly from last week.

APY represents the return your account will generate in a year, taking into account compound interest—the interest earned on both the principal and previously accumulated interest in your account.

For instance, if you were to invest $2,500 at a 5.84% rate (the current high) for one year, you would earn roughly $150 in interest, assuming daily compounding and no additional contributions.

Savings account rates — $10,000 minimum deposit

The average APY for savings accounts requiring a minimum deposit of $10,000 is 0.24%, a tick higher than last week. However, numerous financial institutions offer considerably higher rates.

Some of the top high-yield savings accounts, for instance, currently feature rates of 4.00% or higher.

Per Curinos, the highest interest rate today on a savings account requiring a minimum deposit of $10,000 is 5.35%. If you were to invest $10,000 at a 5.35% rate (the current high) for one year, you would earn more than $550 in interest, assuming daily compounding and no additional contributions.

Methodology

To establish average savings account rates, Curinos focused on savings accounts intended for personal use. Savings accounts that fall into specific categories are excluded, including promotional offers, relationship-based accounts, private, youth, senior and student/minor. The average savings rates quoted above are based on a $2,500 or $10,000 minimum deposit amount.

Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

A high-yield savings account is essentially a standard savings account that offers a higher interest rate on deposits. (It’s more of a description than a technical definition.) This rate can fluctuate based on the broader financial market and the specific bank or credit union’s business requirements.

Like most savings accounts, you can’t access your funds by writing checks and your withdrawals are typically limited.

A high-yield savings account is ideal for those who require a readily accessible option for funds that won’t be touched more than once a week. It’s a recommended choice for most people.

However, if you already have a well-balanced investment portfolio with high earning potential and a convenient savings account with a trusted bank, you might not need or want a high-yield savings account. In this situation, managing an additional account could be an unnecessary hassle.","A person's hand is seen planting a rolled-up dollar bill into the soil, with numerous other rolled-up dollar bills in the background.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA55C6170>,2024-07-01 06:20:32+00:00,https://www.usatoday.com,https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/banking/savings/savings-account-rates-today-07-01-24/,['Business and Finance' 'National'],[0.95 0.7 ],Unlikely,Likely,sample_review/images/a5a2de64fc.png
f8ee736e9b,Financial Times,Britain’s opportunity - Financial Times,"The tectonic plates of British politics have shifted as they do only once every couple of decades. In one parliamentary term, Labour has gone from defeated hard-left rump to landslide centre-left victor. Its breakthrough reflects, in truth, more a humiliating rebuke across the UK of the Conservatives’ 14 years in power than an enthusiastic embrace of Sir Keir Starmer’s party. But the scale of the majority it has secured under Britain’s electoral system bestows on Labour an extraordinary opportunity, and a great responsibility: to rebuild integrity in UK politics, and to demonstrate that competent, moderate government can still deliver for voters.

Labour’s 400-plus seats give it a crucial opening to sweep away years of chaotic and self-serving rule, particularly in the final Tory term under Boris Johnson and Liz Truss. A period of calm stability, of respect for convention and rule of law, of what Starmer called government “unburdened by doctrine”, could begin to unlock the investment so vital to rekindling growth. The party’s parliamentary strength gives it room to enact its programme without being in hock to its hard-left wing.

Labour’s turning of the tables against the Scottish National party is a chance to reinforce the union with Scotland. And, with President Emmanuel Macron weakened in France and Donald Trump bidding to return to the White House, the overwhelming election of a moderate, non-Eurosceptic leader can help the UK to reclaim its role as a voice of democratic rationalism on the world stage.

There is little of the swirl of excitement that greeted Sir Tony Blair’s New Labour, with a comparable majority, in 1997. Starmer’s Labour confronts an exhausted and resigned electorate, with little belief in rapid improvement. The new government’s inheritance is trickier than Blair’s, or that of the post-financial crisis Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition in 2010. The squeeze on public finances is more vicious, the tax burden and borrowing far higher, public services in far worse shape.

Labour also confronts a more fickle and less tribal electorate, more adept at tactical voting. A government with a 170-plus majority could once be confident of more than one term in office. Labour’s own single-term renaissance proves that era is past. While the surge in Nigel Farage’s Reform UK reflected in large part the splitting of the Conservative vote, and its deceptive populist narrative, the nationalist party is now second-placed in almost 100 seats.

The responsibility for Labour, then, is to seize its chance and govern decisively from the centre. It must be ready to make hard choices in the national interest. It needs to rapidly pull the levers it has prioritised to kick-start growth, above all planning reform. It should fast-track legislation to restore integrity and ethics in office. It must hold firm to its pledge to be the party of wealth creation — and resist a self-defeating urge to put all the burden of paying to revive public services on to the wealthy and the wealth creators.

The Conservatives, meanwhile, should draw the right lesson from their collapse. Their vote plunged not because they were insufficiently right wing, but because voters saw them as both arrogant and inept. As Labour has shown, the path back to power lies not in veering further to the extremes but in marching back to the centre ground.

Starmer is coming to office with a lower vote share than any postwar government. Yet, along with the revival of the Liberal Democrats, there is some reassurance that after all the turmoil of the post-Brexit Tory years, the centre in Britain — unlike across the Channel — has broadly held. The true yardstick of success for Labour will be whether it still does so five years from now.

ff3b92b8ab,USA TODAY,"Mother. Mentor. WH resident. Tributes for Marian Robinson, mother of Michelle Obama - USA TODAY","On Nov. 4, 2008, as soon-to-be president Barack Obama watched the tally of electoral college votes come in, his mother-in-law Marian Robinson clasped his hand.

""There was a sense of emotion that I could see in people's faces and in my mother-in-law's face,"" Obama recalled in a post-election interview on CBS' ""60 Minutes."" ""And you had this sense of, well, what's she thinking?""

After Robinson's death on Friday, daughter Michelle Obama, son-in-law Barack Obama, and other family members paid tribute to an extraordinary woman who was perhaps best known by the nation for helping the Obama family at the White House as they cared for their young daughters, Sasha and Malia.

""My mom Marian Robinson was my rock, always there for whatever I needed,"" Michelle Obama said on the social media platform X. ""She was the same steady backstop for our entire family.""

Robinson, who kept a low profile in a residence with the brightest of spotlights, died on Friday. She was 86.

Robinson's thoughts at her son-in-law's election to the presidency were later revealed by her daughter, Michelle Obama in her memoir, ""Becoming"" published more than a decade after that historic night in Chicago.

""Never one to overemote, my mom just gave him a sideways look and shrugged, causing them both to smile,"" the former first lady writes.

She said her mother described to her ""how overcome she’d felt right then, struck just as I’d been by his vulnerability. America had come to see Barack as self-assured and powerful, but my mother also recognized the gravity of the passage, the loneliness of the job ahead. Here was this man who no longer had a father or a mother, about to be elected the leader of the free world.""

Robinson occasionally spoke to the press about her time in the White House. ""You see, my job here is the easiest one of all: I just get to be Grandma,"" Robinson told Essence magazine in an interview published in 2012.

But Robinson would later tell CBS News anchor Gayle King in a rare interview that a mother's worry brought her to the nation's capital. ""It's pretty difficult let face it. Because I felt like this was going to be a very hard life for both of them,"" Robinson told King. ""I was worried about their safety and I was worried about my grandkids. That's what got me to move to D.C.""

She told King she was reticent to speak out publicly while at the White House. ""I figured if I didn't say anything, you couldn't say the wrong thing,"" Robinson said laughing. She said moving into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue was a ""huge adjustment.""

""I talked them into letting me do my own laundry,"" Robinson said.

On Friday, her family lauded her reserved approach. ""The trappings and glamour of the White House were never a great fit for Marian Robinson....Rather than hobnobbing with Oscar winners or Nobel laureates, she preferred spending her time upstairs with a TV tray, in the room outside her bedroom with big windows that looked out at the Washington Monument.""

During her eight years at the White House, the family said she would often sneak outside the gates to buy greeting cards at nearby stores and sometimes other customers would recognize her, saying she resembled the first lady's mother.

""Oh, I get that a lot,"" she would smile and reply.

""There was and will be only one Marian Robinson,"" former President Obama said on X, formerly Twitter on Friday. ""In our sadness we are lifted up by the extraordinary gift of her life. And we will spend the rest of ours trying to live up to her example.""

f6508ed547,The Guardian,Election debate review: everyone struggled to be heard in this seven-way brawl - The Guardian,"Emerging as the winner of a seven-way brawl is never easy and, in the second of this election’s televised debates, nobody won. Either because of the strictures placed on them by their parties’ political situations or because they just didn’t cope very well with the format, every participant struggled.

Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak’s scrappy goalless draw two nights earlier had been dominated by one prepared line: a dubious Tory contention about Labour raising taxes. But as the lights went up at the BBC Radio Theatre at Broadcasting House in London, revealing seven lecterns in a tight V formation, one talking point was at the front of every viewer’s mind. The day’s discourse had been dominated by the prime minister being forced to apologise for leaving a D-day commemoration ceremony early and, perhaps fearing that delaying the inevitable would leave the audience impatiently drumming their fingers, the BBC let the audience get straight to business with a question from a veteran’s son about maintaining the armed forces.

Then came a moment of dissonance, as Labour’s Angela Rayner, making a halting, robotic start, answered the question without mentioning Sunak. Daisy Cooper of the Liberal Democrats, projecting assertively to the back row like a teacher or amateur dramatics veteran who doesn’t require a microphone, did the same. By the time the leader and indeed owner of Reform UK, Nigel Farage, took his turn, his raising of D-day felt a little crow barred in.

The Tory politician handed the turd sandwich of having to defend their leader was Penny Mordaunt, who was in full national-tragedy gravity mode as she solemnly intoned that the prime minister’s actions in Normandy had been “very wrong”. Soon, though, she was back, firing out preprepared attack lines. The tax claim was to reappear later, but the defence-themed question brought out another carefully rehearsed accusation about Labour having not always fully supported the idea of helping to end humanity by participating in global thermonuclear war: “If your foe does not believe that you will use these weapons, the deterrent is gone.” Mordaunt somehow used this atomic attack line again in answer to the night’s second question, about the NHS.

Rayner had perhaps the most impossible, or simply pointless, task, of all the seven talking heads. If it didn’t really matter what Mordaunt said because the Tories have already lost, Labour having as good as won the election meant the same applied to Rayner. She seemed grateful for a slanging match with Mordaunt giving her something to say. The drawing of lots that determined where the speakers stood had put the pair together: Rayner often turned away from the other five participants and went at it with Mordaunt until the show’s presenter, Mishal Husain, told them to stop. Carla Denyer, of the Green party, got the only proper laugh of the evening for her reaction to one particularly cacophonous burst of cross-talk: “That was terribly dignified, wasn’t it?”

Denyer ought to have flourished here, but her crack at Rayner and Mordaunt’s expense was one of the few occasions when she successfully managed to seem like she was confidently being herself. Almost always reading her answers from notes and admittedly not helped by frequent interruptions from Husain, her focus on individual policy proposals rather than revolutionary political ideas saw her fall into the trap of sounding small-time, a junior partner in the evening’s enterprise.

Stephen Flynn of the Scottish National party and Rhun ap Iorwerth of Plaid Cymru were also there, in theory, to freshen and expand the debate. They helped Denyer out by making similar points more pithily, but couldn’t ever quite overcome the fundamental difficulty of addressing the whole of the UK while only actually caring about the votes of their own nation. Flynn, fluent but a shade too intense, brought his every answer straight back to Scotland, which clanged in the context of what the speaker before him had said; Iorwerth had a more rounded everyman quality but still didn’t commit to much discourse that wasn’t confined to Wales.","Two women are standing on a stage with podiums, one in a red dress and the other in a blue suit, facing each other with a microphone between them.

b2b444de85,New York Post,"Keep your water sparkling clean with the best pool vacuums, per experts - New York Post","As warm temps arise and we’re opening our above-ground pools or in-ground pools (or, if you’re working with a smaller space, picking up an inflatable pool), it’s a good idea to look into buying a quality pool vacuum to maintain your makeshift backyard oasis.

While we all wish we could have a pool cleaner like a five-star all-inclusive resort, we have to pick up the rein as a pool owner. Regularly maintaining your pool — along with ensuring you buy a pool cover once the season ends — is a best practice to preserve the longevity of your favorite place to be in the summer.

RELATED: The 17 best pool floats to use in summer 2024

“A pool vacuum is a great way to help keep your pool water balanced, prevent or remove algae and keep the pool generally looking great,” Brian Shaunfield, store manager of Charlotte area Lowe’s, told the New York Post. “As you open your pool at the start of the season, pool vacuums are also handy for quickly pulling up anything that settled to the bottom during the off-season. And throughout the summer months, they make regular maintenance of your pool simple.”

While you’re shopping, check out our expert-backed guide to the best places to buy outdoor patio furniture, along with our roundups to the best pool chaise lounge chairs and best pool floats.

Best Overall: Dolphin Nautilus CC Plus Wi-Fi Robotic Pool Vacuum Cleaner

Meet the latest Dolphin Nautilus, complete with smartphone technology that allows you to clean your pool from anywhere, or as Zuchelli put it, “in your sleep.”

It takes two hours to clean with a plug-and-play setup. “We love this vacuum for commercial clients who want the technology of a robotic cleaner but won’t break the bank,” Zuchelli said. Plus, it climbs walls extremely well with intense scrubbing power. All in all, you get the most bang for your buck here.

Best In-ground: Dolphin Explorer E20 Robotic Pool Vacuum Cleaner

“Ideal for in-ground swimming pools up to 33 feet, this compact cleaner will have your pool ready for use in just two hours,” Shaunfield explained. “The Explorer E20 scrubs your pool floor and walls with ease and filters out unwanted debris for a clean shine.”

Its plug-and-play operation makes pool cleaning easy and reduces wear and tear on your pool pump and filter as well. Plus, its quick water release makes it easy to remove the Explorer E20 from the pool.

Best Cordless: AIPER Scuba S1 Cordless Robotic Pool Cleaner

Frustrated with ugly pool cords? Not anymore. “This sleek pool cleaner is cordless, which means no more tangled cords or issues with connectivity to the control base station,” said Zuchelli, adding that Aiper “could be the innovation we’ve all been waiting for.”

This cordless cleaner charges in three hours and provides over two hours of cleaning time. It can automatically operate for up to a week without a single charge. Now that’s noteworthy.

Best Budget: Aqua EZ 5″ Underwater Handheld Pool Vacuum

“The Aqua handheld pool vacuum is an underwater vacuum cleaner with an aluminum pole handle and is great for cleaning small pools, large fountains, and ponds,” Shaunfield said. It efficiently vacuums debris into a fine mesh bag, and — even better — no filter system is required; the vacuum uses water pressure from garden hoses.

Best Splurge: The VacDaddy FAST & POWERFUL Handheld Portable Pool Vacuum

“This hand-held pool cleaner is your modern-day in-pool Dirt Devil on steroids,” said Zuchelli. “Its innovative engineering provides unmatched suction.” Setup time is just under one minute and works for both small and large pools, capturing unwanted debris in a snap.

Best Above-Ground: Dolphin E10 Robotic Pool Vacuum Cleaner

“The Dolphin E10 is ideal for above-ground swimming pools up to 30 feet and will have the pool clean and ready for splashing fun in just 1.5 hours,” Shaunfield highlighted. “Its plug-and-play operation takes the manual work out of pool cleaning.”

Specifically, this model features a top-load filter basket that provides superior filtering capabilities. Its quick water release makes it easy to remove the E10 from the pool as well, much like the brand’s E20 model.

Best for Handheld: Aqua EZ-11 Rechargeable Suction Pool Vacuum

“The Aqua EZ is a rechargeable underwater vacuum and is ideal for cleaning up small debris in your pool or spa,” Shaunfield said, recommending the product. “The vacuum can be handheld or connected to any standard pool pole.”

Its rechargeable lithium battery provides constant performance for 30 minutes, saving you less time cleaning and more time splashing. Its quick drain system releases clean water when lifting cleaner out of pool as well.

Best Robotic: Polaris Robotic Pool Vacuum

“Complete with WiFi and iAquaLink App control, you can conveniently set up cleaning schedules and control your Polaris pool vacuum anytime, from anywhere with a mobile device,” Shaunfield said. “This pool vacuum features a 4-wheel drive design and is ready to tackle any pool terrain without getting stuck.”

You’ll also appreciate its caddy included for compact storage and easy portability. Its Vortex Vacuum Technology allows the cleaner to pick up larger debris while maintaining maximum suction, too.

Best Value: Intex Robotic Pool Vacuum

“This robotic pool vacuum keeps your above-ground pool’s water crystal clear and un-cloudy,” Shaunfield noted. “Its built-in filter traps dust, dirt, leaves, and more for convenient disposal in the removable half-gallon filter basket.”

This model processes up to 700 gallons per hour, making it ideal for maintaining most pools. It also comes with an internal mesh filter and features a 0.48-gallon basket for quick and easy disposal.

Best Versatile: Kokido Robotic Pool Vacuum

“Designed to use in both in-ground and above-ground pools with flat bottoms, this high-tech pool cleaner delivers quality results on any pool surface,” Shaunfield said. “The cordless design of the Delta 200 also conveniently eliminates the need for electric connection and unsafe cables near the water.”

It’s even backed with an intelligent “stop-and-go” system that automatically enables the cleaner to turn around upon contact with the pool wall. Inside, you’ll find all assembly parts, a charging cord, one standard filter, one basic retrieval kit and instructions to get started right away — all in box.

Best Blaster: Blue Wave Pool Blaster Fusion Handheld Pool Vacuum

“This powerful cleaner uses a rechargeable lithium battery that provides up to 45 minutes of cleaning time,” Shaunfield highlights. “You can easily attach the included four-piece pole for deep-depth cleaning.”

All debris is suctioned into the unit’s reusable, easy-to-clean filter bag to save time and money, too. Its reusable, extra-large filter bag is easy to clean — a feature worth applauding.

Best for Commercial: Dolphin Wave 120 Commercial Robotic Pool Vacuum Cleaner

“The Dolphin Wave 120 Commercial Robotic Vacuum is the Cadillac of commercial pool vacuums,” said Zuchelli, “Its capabilities for cleaning Olympic-size swimming pools are unmatched.” This is not your average pool cleaner, it is designed for extremely large surfaces and can “turn a storm-ravaged swimming pool into a masterpiece in under four hours.”

The large bottom-load bag filter is easy to clean and picks up small and large debris. “There are few robotic cleaners that can compare to this classic,” remarked Zuchelli.

An FAQ on Pool Vacuums

Ahead, Shaunfield answered common questions surrounding pool vacuums so you can best understand how to use one before you shop.

The different types of pool vacuums on the market, explained by an expert

Shaunfield lists the various pool vacuum models on the market — including what to know about each one:

Handheld Pool Vacuum: These are the most affordable and will get the job done well, especially if you’re spot-cleaning a specific area of the pool. They do require effort on the part of the owner, so just make sure you’re up to the task.

Wand Pool Vacuums: These are perfect for removing dirt, leaves, sand and other small bits of debris. They come in handy when you want small jobs done quickly. They’re also lightweight, hose-free and easy to maneuver.

Robotic Pool Vacuum: These will do the work for you when time is of the essence or you’re unwilling or unable to manually vacuum the pool. They automatically clean the pool floor, walls and steps while filtering the water as it moves.

“Before you purchase a vacuum, make sure you know the type and depth of the pool it will be cleaning,” he added. “Once you determine that, you can choose between handheld, wand, suction and robotic pool vacuums, among other models.”

More, depending on their function and type, the vacuums can be corded or cordless, as well as manual or automatic.

What to look for in a quality pool vacuum, according to an expert

Of course, the best pool vacuum for you depends on the type of pool you have and how much time you want to invest in maintenance. Your budget also is a key factor.

“For example, handheld pool vacuums are a bit more affordable and are good for spot-cleaning a specific area of the pool,” Shaunfield said. “Robotic vacuums, while a bit pricier, are fast, efficient and plug-and-play out of the box, making setup and use a breeze.”

How often should I clean my pool?

During peak season, you should clean your pool about once a week. “You should also plan to clean your pool after large parties where many people are using it, as well as after storms,” he added.

A manual pool vacuum is adequate for most above-ground pools, but there are automatic pool cleaners available that will work as well. The same applies to in-ground pools.

Your step-by-step guide on how to properly vacuum a pool, per an expert

Shaunfield highlights exactly how you should vacuum your pool to yield the best results:

First, you should skim the water with a pool skimmer to remove leaves and other debris floating on top of the water. Using a pool brush, brush the walls, floor and steps of the pool to dislodge algae and stuck-on debris.

Next, if you’re using a robotic vacuum, follow the manufacturer’s instructions to set it up and let it run. It’s easy to use and will do the cleaning for you automatically. When the job is done, simply remove the vacuum from the pool, remove and empty the basket, and then hose down the vacuum and baskets.

To vacuum the pool using a handheld pool vacuum with a telescoping pole, first make sure the filter is running. You should then place the vacuum head and pole with one end of the hose attached into the pool to fill with water. Next, hold the open end of the hose over one of the return jets to fill it with water and blow out all the air in the hose. When bubbles stop coming out of the vacuum head, have someone turn off the filter, keeping the end of the hose underwater.

Insert an adapter into the skimmer intake, then hook the hose up to the adapter. Always turn off the pump when changing the filter settings.

Whichever surface you’re vacuuming — the floor, walls or steps — make sure the vacuum stays in contact with the surface and that you’re slowly guiding the vacuum along the pool surfaces. Pay special attention to the areas that get little circulation as they’re prime areas for algae growth. When you’re finished, turn the filter off, disconnect the hose and turn the system back to ‘filter.’

“Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions for your model of pool vacuum, but for many vacuums, simply remove the vacuum from the pool, remove and empty the basket or bag and then hose down the vacuum and baskets,” Shaunfield noted.

To extend the life of a robotic pool cleaner, remove it from the pool after each use, rinse off well and store in a cool, dry place, too.

3bea7385f4,The Globe and Mail,What role could Iran’s proxy forces play in retaliation against Israel over Hamas leader’s killing? - The Globe and Mail,"As Iran threatens to respond to the suspected Israeli assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, the regional militias that the Islamic Republic has armed for decades could play a role in any attack.

Here’s a look at Iran’s history of arming militias, its allies in the region and what part they could play.

Why has Iran got proxy forces?

Iran’s policy of arming militias took root in the aftermath of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Before it, the U.S. provided major weapon systems including F-14 Tomcat fighter jets to the government of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. After the revolution and the U.S. Embassy hostage crisis, those shipments and needed maintenance programs stopped. Iran’s eight-year war with Iraq in the 1980s destroyed much of its arsenal. International sanctions on Iran, including over its nuclear program, also have kept it from receiving new arms while Israel and Gulf Arab states allied with the U.S. have received advanced weapons. While developing its own missile program, Iran can’t match those sophisticated weapons. It relies on militias as an asymmetric threat to squeeze both Israel and the United States.

Who are Iran’s regional allies?

Iran’s arming began in earnest in the 1980s with Shiite forces in Lebanon fighting against Israel. They became the Hezbollah militia. The arming expanded with the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein, a long-time foe of Tehran. Iran strongly backed Syrian President Bashar Assad in his country’s long war. And Iran has continued when the opportunity has arisen, even arming Sunni militants while viewing itself as the world’s defenders of Shiite Muslims. Those relationships are managed by Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.

The militias in Iran’s self-described “Axis of Resistance” include these:

Iraqi militias

In Iraq, Iran supported a slew of forces that mobilized in 2014 to battle the Islamic State group. Those state-sanctioned, mainly Shiite militias, known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, have grown into a powerful political faction, armed with rockets, drones and other weaponry. The International Institute for Strategic Studies puts their strength at some 180,000 fighters. Other smaller or little-known militant groups have emerged and claimed attacks against U.S. forces as well amid this Israel-Hamas war. Iran-backed armed groups attacked U.S. personnel in Iraq more than 60 times between October and Feb. 4, according to the Congressional Research Service. The deadliest came Jan. 28, when the U.S. said a drone launched by Iranian-backed Iraqi militias hit a facility known as Tower 22 in Jordan on the Syrian border, killing three American troops and wounding dozens of others. In response, U.S. air strikes hit more than 85 targets at seven locations, including command and control headquarters, intelligence centres, rockets and missiles, drone and ammunition storage sites and other facilities connected to the militias or the Guard’s expeditionary Quds Force.

Lebanon’s Hezbollah

Hezbollah formed in 1982 amid Israel’s occupation of southern Lebanon. Israel remains highly wary of Hezbollah, particularly over the vast missile arsenal it is believed to possess and its battle-hardened forces who also supported Assad in Syria. While Israel has sophisticated missile defences including its Iron Dome system, a mass barrage of fire from Hezbollah and others at the same time could overwhelm the country. Estimates suggest Hezbollah has an arsenal of 150,000 rockets and missiles, including precision-guided missiles. The militia also has been blamed for suicide bombings in the past, including a 1983 bombing in Beirut that killed 241 American servicemen, though the group maintains it wasn’t behind the attack. Hezbollah also has drones and surface-to-air missile systems. Hezbollah’s forces number as many as 25,000 full-time fighters, with additional tens of thousands in reserves, according to an Israeli military assessment. Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah in 2021 said the group had 100,000 trained fighters.

Palestinian militant forces

Despite being Sunni, both the Palestinian militant group Hamas and Islamic Jihad have received weaponry and other materiel from Iran. The groups, however, have been struck hard by Israel since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack that began the war, which saw militants kill 1,200 people and take 250 others hostage. Israel’s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip since has killed at least 39,580 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. Israel’s military says it has killed roughly 15,000 militants in the war.

Yemen’s Houthi rebels

The Houthis have held Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, since 2014 as part of that country’s ruinous war. They follow the Shiite Zaydi faith, a branch of Shiite Islam that is almost exclusively found in Yemen. While broadly an insurgent force, the group with Iran’s support is now able to launch drone and missile attacks that have drastically disrupted shipping in the Red Sea corridor and now even reach Israel. The U.S. Navy’s efforts at stopping the shipping attacks has led to the most intense continue combat its sailors have faced since World War II, but has yet to end the assaults. The amount of direct command Iran wields over the Houthis, however, remains a matter of debate among experts. The Houthis’ attacks have raised their international profile while cracking down on dissent at home. The rebels claim they've recruited 200,000 additional fighters since launching their attacks. The rebels and their allies have a fighting force of some 20,000 fighters, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies.

What could any retaliatory strike look like?

In April following an Israeli attack on the Iranian Embassy compound in Syria, Iran launched 170 bomb-carrying drones, more than 30 cruise missiles and more than 120 ballistic missiles toward Israel. Israel, the U.S. and other nations shot down many of the projectiles, some of which came from Yemen. Iran could launch a similar assault, but this time Hezbollah may get involved as the militia seeks revenge for the Israeli strike last week killing senior commander Fouad Shukur. Such an assault could strain Israeli air defences, meaning more missile strikes raising the risk of casualties – and of a further escalation experts fear could lead to a wider regional war.","A group of individuals, some holding flags and rifles, marching in a desert-like environment under a clear blue sky.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6B7E6F2E00>,2024-08-05 12:53:53.877000+00:00,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-what-role-could-irans-proxy-forces-play-in-retaliation-against-israel/,['International' 'Politics'],[0.9  0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/3bea7385f4.png
0169733835,USA TODAY,"Biden is on Paxlovid to fight COVID: What to know about accessibility, effectiveness - USA TODAY","Joe Biden has COVID-19 again and is using Paxlovid, the Pfizer medication that has been widely used in the treatment of COVID symptoms since 2021.

The reassurance that the president, who is at increased risk of complications due to his age, is already being treated was a comfort to some. To others, however, the ease with which Biden was able to access COVID treatment and medications struck a cord as some Americans have struggled to get their hands on the drug since Pfizer began charging $1,400 for it in November.

Critics on social media pointed out that the average American may not have such expedited access to Paxlovid or other popular COVID treatments.

Biden's public endorsement of the drug has also led to a resurgence of interest in it − and some recent studies that found it may not be as effective across all populations as we originally thought.

Here are the basics of what to know about Paxlovid.

Joe Biden tests positive for COVID:How many times has he had it?

What is Paxlovid?

Paxlovid is the name of a drug manufactured by Pfizer that is used in the treatment of COVID-19. It is a combination of two drugs called ritonavir and nirmatrelvir.

Nirmatrelvir is a protease inhibitor that stops the SARS-CoV-2 virus from replicating while ritonavir boosts the activity of nirmatrelvir. It is given in a five-day course with three pills taken twice a day and is meant to be taken within five days of testing positive for COVID-19.

The purpose of Paxlovid is to lessen the severity of symptoms and prevent severe illness, hospitalization and/or death.

Is Paxlovid FDA approved?

Yes, Paxlovid was officially approved by the FDA in May 2023 for treating ""mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death.""

Before this, in December 2021, it was approved for emergency treatment of adults and pediatric patients over 12 years of age via emergency use authorization.

How much does Paxlovid cost? Does insurance cover it?

Paxlovid was distributed for free via the Biden administration until late November 2023, when it transferred over to the commercial market. The initial reported price set by Pfizer was $1,390 for one course, though depending on the pharmacy it can now cost upward of $1,500.

The Department of Health and Human Services and Pfizer rolled out patient assistance programs to provide Paxlovid for free through Medicare and Medicaid until at least the end of 2024. Those without insurance can get it for free through 2028.

Insurance coverage has become trickier for some as more time has elapsed since the beginning of the pandemic. Some people have reported copays as high as $1,000 or insurers who refuse to cover it entirely. This inconsistency has led some to express concern that despite ample supply, the drug will not be used as widely as it could be were cost not a barrier.

Is Paxlovid effective?

Paxlovid has been found to be useful, but only for a select group: those who are unvaccinated and those at high risk for severe disease because of advanced age or health conditions. The treatment has been found to be less effective for people who would be expected to have a mild case of COVID-19.

Some recent studies have suggested Paxlovid may not lower the risk of long-term COVID for vaccinated, non-hospitalized people during their first COVID-19 infection or help them recover faster.

However, when the Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee recommended FDA approval of the drug, the agency heard that data showed Paxlovid reduced the risk of hospitalization and death bymore than 80% in high-risk adults who had a previous bout of COVID-19 or never had the disease, and had a 58% reduced risk in those who were vaccinated.

And a January study by the National Institutes of Health also found that 15% of the 1 million participants infected with COVID-19 took Paxlovid and of those, the medication reduced the risk of death by 73% and hospitalizations dropped 26%.

What is Paxlovid rebound?

""Rebound"" is also a frequent discussion around the drug − testing positive for COVID-19 or experiencing symptoms again two to eight days after recovery, though it also occurs in people with COVID-19 who don't take the drug.

Studies on rebound are still scarce and inconclusive, with some showing that there may be an increased chance after taking Paxlovid and some saying otherwise. Official guidance from the National Institutes of Health, however, still says that the possibility of rebound is not ample reason to avoid taking Paxlovid if it is prescribed to you.","An older man in a dark suit and striped tie, wearing a black mask, adjusts his tie while standing outside a white building.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BCB571870>,2024-07-19 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.usatoday.com,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/07/19/what-is-paxlovid-covid/74460157007/,['Health' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/0169733835.png
1fe39944a0,Financial Times,Big Tech regulatory crackdown spreads to Asia and Australia - Financial Times,"Japan, South Korea and Australia are tightening rules to rein in the market power of big tech groups, posing fresh regulatory challenges for Apple and Google following a similar crackdown in the EU and US.

The cabinet of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida recently approved landmark legislation aimed at preventing the largest online platforms from using their dominance in mobile software to thwart the entry of new rivals.

The rules — a narrower version of the EU’s sweeping Digital Markets Act — seek to offer more choices for consumers, such as by making it easier to switch between mobile operating systems and allowing users to download apps from other sources.

The move in Tokyo comes as officials in South Korea intend to introduce wide-ranging legislation to regulate online platforms, targeting ecommerce players to streaming services and social media providers. In Australia, watchdogs are pushing to widen the regime for online regulation into areas including digital payments.

Tech industry players said the spread of regulatory scrutiny from Europe and the US to the biggest markets in Asia presents deeper troubles for the world’s biggest technology companies.

In the EU, legislation has forced Apple to change core parts of its closed mobile operating system, such as allowing users to download apps from other sources for the first time and changing the fee structure charged to developers. While in the US, the iPhone maker has been hit by a sweeping antitrust case that alleges the Silicon Valley giant uses its power in the smartphone sector to quash rivals and limit consumer choice.

“If you know there is a change in legislation and if that is just limited to Europe, you might try to fight it,” one tech industry executive said. “But if you see that legislation that happened in Europe is happening in Japan, South Korea, Australia and the UK, at some point you’ve learned your lesson and say why am I fighting?”

In Japan, legislation drafted by the country’s Fair Trade Commission does not name specific companies; rather, it focuses on unravelling the duopoly held by Apple and Google owner Alphabet, as their iOS and Android software controls almost all of Japan’s market for mobile operating systems.

“Considering the monopolistic circumstances with app stores, we want to realise an environment where the benefits of growth in the digital area can be enjoyed in a fair and equitable manner,” Kazuyuki Furuya, the FTC’s chair, said in late April.

In the face of heavy lobbying by Apple to block the bill, people familiar with the discussions said its scope was intentionally narrow in order to avoid delays in introducing the new rules, which are expected to be enacted late next year if parliament passes the bill.

The law would allow Japanese regulators to hit companies with hefty fines that could amount to up to 20 per cent of domestic annual revenue if they are found guilty of non-compliance. For repeat infringements within a period of 10 years, the fine can be raised to 30 per cent of annual turnover.

Apple generated $24bn in revenue in Japan last year. The company declined to comment specifically on the Japanese legislation and other regulatory measures in Asia. It said it had limited changes to iOS “to the European Union because we’re concerned about their impacts on privacy and security of our users’ experience”.

Google said it had “proactively engaged” with the government to explain its practices, adding that “we will continue to collaborate with the government and industry stakeholders throughout this process”.

In previous discussions with Tokyo, Google has also argued that the fees it charges developers are necessary to ensure the safety and security measures for its mobile Play store.

While regulators worldwide are given larger enforcement powers, some industry players remain sceptical that the rules being introduced globally would have the desired effect of opening up more competition in the digital marketplace.

Other people advising the industry in Tokyo also suggested that the chances of Japan’s FTC actually imposing the new fines were limited for now because big tech groups were likely to negotiate closely with regulators ahead of the bill’s enactment. Recent investigations by the FTC involving Apple and Google have often been resolved with the two companies presenting remedies.

In South Korea, regulators are struggling to enforce a 2021 telecommunications law designed to break Apple and Google’s hold over in-app payments, by forcing the US tech giants to cut transaction fees and offer third-party payment options.

The legislation, which was supported by a coalition of app developers including Tinder owner Match Group, Spotify and Epic Games, was the first of its kind in the world.

In October last year, the Korea Communications Commission said it planned to fine Apple and Google for violations of the law after South Korean mobile gaming developers accused them of continuing to levy fees in breach of the new rules. Both companies have denied the allegations.

Wi Jong-hyun, professor of business at Chung-Ang University in Seoul, said it was hard for regulators to enforce the law because South Korean companies tend not to disclose their contracts with the big US app stores.

“Korean app developers generally prefer not to file complaints against Apple and Google because they are afraid of potential reprisals,” said Wi. “They have seen other apps forced off the app stores, and they know that once they have been kicked out it takes a long time to re-enter.”

Apple said it had clear guidelines to help developers understand its rules, which are applied equally.

South Korean officials also intend to introduce a broader legislation, which like the EU’s DMA, is expected to identify dominant online platforms that would be subjected to tougher scrutiny.

Practices being targeted by the Korea Fair Trade Commission include the “self-preferencing” of a platform’s own products, as well as restricting companies from selling goods elsewhere or more cheaply.

“We will strengthen our scrutiny of the monopolistic abuse of platforms and their unfair trade practices,” KFTC chair Han Ki-jeong told the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea in March.

Wi said the picture in South Korea was complicated by the fact that in many online sectors, the most dominant players were not the US big tech groups but local platforms including Naver, Kakao and the US-domiciled ecommerce market leader Coupang.

“South Korea can’t be as tough as the EU because it also needs to protect its local players,” Wi added, noting that Seoul was also sensitive to Washington’s objections given discussions over subsidies and export controls in the all-important chip sector.

Australia has also been a pioneer in tech regulation, introducing legislation to crack down on multinational tax avoidance, online safety and measures to push large digital companies to pay media companies to support the news industry.

In recent months, Canberra has moved to broaden its regulatory scrutiny into digital payments and enforce existing measures that are being resisted by technology businesses. As part of the effort, the government will introduce legislation this year imposing mandatory obligations on social media companies, banks and telecoms companies to tackle scammers.

Stephen Jones, minister for financial services, told the Financial Times that the Australian government’s review of digital platforms was focused on digital scams, which he called the “biggest part of the problem”.

Among the proposals is for social media companies to verify businesses advertising on their platforms. Another area under review is digital payments, where banks are regulated but companies such as Apple and Google offering similar services are not.

“[Big tech companies are] not regulated and they’ve got to be brought into the tent,” said Jones.

4ac37822fe,The Guardian,Imposter: The Man Who Came Back from the Dead review – the absolute zenith of true-crime TV - The Guardian,"It has seemed lately as though the true-crime documentary might have had its day. Even recent offerings from Netflix, the wellspring of the genre, have begun to feel a bit tired or desperate. A four-part series from Channel 4 on the subject of a US fugitive who faked his own death seemed, therefore, an unpromising proposition.

But there is still room, it turns out, for truly extraordinary stories – especially ones aided by a cast of tremendously televisual real-life characters – to break through and make you boggle once more in disbelief at the weirdness this world can hold.

Imposter: The Man Who Came Back from the Dead tells the story of a Covid patient in a Glasgow hospital who in 2021 woke from a coma to find himself accused of being one of the FBI’s most wanted criminals: Nicholas Rossi, a US citizen and registered sex offender, who had faked his own death after several rape charges. The name by which his English wife of four years, Miranda, knew her supposedly Irish husband was Arthur Knight – one of several aliases, said US authorities, he used to commit then escape his violent and fraudulent activities.

You may remember Knight/Rossi from the media coverage – which he courted assiduously – at the time. He was the man in the wheelchair and the oxygen mask fervently insisting on his innocence and rolling up his sleeves to prove that he did not have the tattoos the police say helped identify him as Rossi – along with the fingerprints they took that one might have thought would settle the matter.

But the series is stuffed with reveals, switchbacks and hairpin turns to Rossi’s story long before we arrive at that hospital bed in Glasgow, most of which are related by people so mesmerising you cannot believe they haven’t been sent straight from central casting and scripted to a T.

Rossi’s father, David, talks about all the treatment centres and courses he and his wife sent their son to in the hope of controlling his “wicked” behaviour. Later, he reveals that he once beat the boy bloody, pushed past endurance when “Nicky” was hitting his mother at Disney World.

Rossi went into foster care and massaged stories of his abuse and torture there into the beginnings of a political career. As a teenager, he interned as a page, under the name of Nicholas Alahverdian, at the Rhode Island House of Representatives. A local politician, Brian Coogan, wanted to adopt him – until the judge in charge told him Alahverdian had been placed in care because he was violent with his mother, grandmother and siblings and was in fact the instigator of all the abuses he talked about, victimising other children. The state was running out of places to put him, but the judge wouldn’t let Coogan adopt him.

From there, Rossi seems to have gone through life causing as much suffering as you might imagine an untrammelled apparent psychopath would do. Victims of his sexual violence are given time to tell their stories and do so with startling honesty and composure. “I felt emotionally, psychologically and mentally raped already,” says Michelle Minnaar, at whose UK home he arrived from the US a few days after they met online. “The physical part was just icing on the cake.” His first wife, who met him at a Mormon singles event, says he started beating her the moment they were married (the secret recordings she made before escaping are harrowing); she felt nothing but relief when news of his supposed death in Moscow reached her.

The intimidatory tactics and countersuits mount and more US police and investigators become involved, until, US authorities claim, Rossi fakes his own death and flees to Scotland. Undeterred, the authorities tighten the noose until eventually Rossi is reduced to claiming in court that a tattoo artist crept into the Covid ward while he was unconscious to frame him by reproducing the Rossi ink on Knight’s arms. He continues to claim that he is Knight and denies all of Rossi’s alleged crimes.

It is a meticulous documentary series that, as all the best in the genre do, shows you what happens when someone is born devoid of any belief that social or moral rules apply to them. It is always fascinating, always terrifying, and in Rossi’s story it seems to have reached its zenith. And yet. The genre may have plucked all the lowest hanging fruit, but there will, it seems, always be another story to be told.","A man with glasses and a red tie is seen through blinds, with a five-star rating from The Guardian logo in the bottom left corner.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BA23F0C70>,2024-05-20 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/may/20/imposter-the-man-who-came-back-from-the-dead-review-true-crime-tv,['Entertainment' 'Other'],[0.85 0.15],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/4ac37822fe.png
e4dd6c17d3,HuffPost,New York City Cops Don’t Seem To Know That Trump Salutes And Honors Police-Assaulters - HuffPost,"NEW YORK — Donald Trump, who is accused of dozens of felonies and literally salutes violent rioters who assaulted police officers, has nevertheless been treated like a hero by New York City police officers during his criminal trial — possibly because many are unaware of his pledge to pardon those who attacked officers during his Jan. 6, 2021, coup attempt.

“That’s news to me,” said one on a lower Manhattan street corner that the former president’s motorcade had just driven past.

“I had not heard that,” said another near the parked black shuttle buses that have been ferrying Trump’s congressional supporters — who attack the trial judge and district attorney on his behalf — to and from Trump Tower.

In fact, of two dozen New York City police officers interviewed by HuffPost within a few blocks of the Centre Street courthouse where a jury will soon decide his fate, only one said he knew that Trump routinely honors the Jan. 6 police-assaulters and plans to pardon them.

“I don’t think that should happen,” said the officer who, like the others, spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to talk to the press while in uniform and on duty. “I think that sets a bad example. If you do a crime, you should be held accountable for it.”

At his rallies, the former and would-be future president stands at attention and even salutes while a recording of the national anthem, sung by Jan. 6 jail detainees who violently assaulted police on that day, is played over the loudspeakers. In speech after speech, he has called those accused and, in many cases, convicted of felonies “hostages” and “political prisoners,” and has vowed to grant them pardons if he is elected.

Trump, who faces 88 felony charges himself, throughout his criminal trial has been treated like a celebrity by New York City police officers, nonetheless. Video from April 16, for example, shows him shaking hands and taking photos with a group of officers outside a campaign stop following that day’s court proceedings.

“That’s not the police officers’ initiative. That’s him wanting to shake hands,” said one officer last week, adding that he also did not know about Trump’s promise to pardon those who had assaulted his fellow officers. “I don’t know anything about that.”

The New York Police Department did not respond to HuffPost queries about officers’ interactions with an accused criminal currently on trial, particularly one who promises to pardon those convicted of assaulting police officers.

The city’s Police Benevolent Association, which endorsed Trump in 2020, also did not respond to HuffPost queries on those same topics. The group typically issues fiery responses when someone accused of assaulting an officer is not kept in jail pending trial or is otherwise treated leniently.

“Criminals who assault police officers are seeing no jail time,” the union wrote in a Jan. 3 press release earlier this year.

A month later, upon the announcement of additional indictments against gang members who had attacked officers in Times Square in late January, the union said: “They should be in jail. We won’t call it justice until they are all behind bars.”

The group’s website does not indicate whether the union has condemned Trump for his stance on those who assaulted police on Jan. 6. It also did not issue a statement condemning the Jan. 6 rioters whose actions injured 140 police officers and led to the deaths of five in the following days and months. The union’s then-president did criticize the mob two days later but, notably, did not criticize Trump for having instigated the attack.

Trump’s reception from police officers in New York is similar to the one he gets from officers around the country. He typically has a line of officers willing to shake his hand and be photographed with him when he boards his plane after a campaign visit.

The Trump campaign has over a period of many months never responded to HuffPost questions about his praise for and promises to pardon Jan. 6 rioters who assaulted police, and did not respond this time, either.

The affinity of many police officers for Trump, despite Jan. 6 and despite all the charges he faces, does not surprise Zachary Carter, a former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn who more recently led New York City’s legal office.

“He gives cops permission to give in to their worst impulses,” Carter said of Trump, recalling a speech in which Trump told police they didn’t need to be so careful about preventing head injuries to people they arrest as they put them in the back seat of their cruisers. “Is there a certain kind of cop receptive to someone who gives out that signal? Yes.”

Carter said Trump also enjoys the sort of admiration some people have for members of the Mafia. “Organized crime figures have a cult following. Even people in law enforcement are drawn to it,” he said.

Trump is currently on trial on charges that he falsified business records to hide a $130,000 hush payment to a porn star to keep her claim about a sexual encounter with him from coming out before the 2016 election. Closing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday morning, with the jury set to receive the case for deliberations after that.

If convicted, Trump could receive up to four years in prison.

Trump is also facing prosecutions in three other jurisdictions. A federal indictment in Washington, D.C., and a state court indictment in Georgia are both based on his actions leading up to his coup attempt. A second federal indictment in South Florida is based on his refusal to turn over secret documents he took with him to his Palm Beach country club when he left the White House.

6ee6a03cb6,Financial Times,Europe’s political divide over the return of wolves - Financial Times,"One afternoon in early April a mist descended across the Picos de Europa mountains in northern Spain, where Guadalupe Vada was out with her sheep.

At this time of year they graze in the lower peaks close to the village, before moving into mountains for the summer. As evening drew in, she left the flock of 800 for the night, guarded by eight Mastiff dogs, and returned home.

At sunrise the sky had cleared. Three vultures flew in circles high above the area where Vada knew the sheep were. “I thought, that’s it. Something’s happened,” she recounts. Heading to where the flock had been she saw that around seven sheep had been attacked.

During the night, a group of around 20 had become separated in the fog, leaving them vulnerable. “Of course the wolves took advantage, because when they see an opportunity, that’s what they’ll do,” she says.

Wolves have always occupied the north-west corner of Spain, gradually crossing the Cantabrian range east into Asturias and farther south in the 1980s. But recently the population has expanded dramatically to parts of the country where they had long been extinct, sighted as far away as Madrid.

Thanks to wildlife protection measures introduced by the EU, once-threatened wolf populations are making a comeback. There are now around 20,300 wolves in the EU — up 81 per cent since 2012, and their range has grown by 25 per cent in the past 10 years. Wolves are now present in nearly all EU countries; Spain alone has more than 2,100, one of the largest populations in the EU.

Wolves can bring important ecological benefits to the ecosystem, such as limiting the population of wild ungulates such as boar and deer that damage agriculture and forestry. Green legislation championed by European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has included proposals to rewild large parts of Europe and allow the recovery of large carnivores.

But this triumph for conservation has put pressure on rural communities in areas like Cantabria, where there are fewer wild prey sources and pastoral farmers have to manage the growing threat to their animals, which spend much of the year roaming freely on the mountainside.

Little has been done by regional and national governments to prepare communities for life alongside wolves, says Hanna Pettersson, a social scientist at the University of York’s Leverhulme Centre for Anthropocene Biodiversity. “If we’re doing rewilding, bringing all these species back in Europe, which is densely populated, how is that going to work on the ground?”

Policies regarding wolf populations are decided at a national and EU level with limited engagement with people in affected areas, she says. “One of the biggest sources of anger is the feeling that it’s something really impacting your life, and you cannot do anything about it. We have to find ways to make it work with local people. Forcing them top down, it’s never going to work.”

This anger encapsulates the frustrations being felt by many farmers and rural dwellers across Europe. When the European Commission launched a “long-term vision” for the bloc’s rural areas in 2020, a consultation for the initiative found that 40 per cent of people living in rural areas said they felt left behind.

Over the winter, tens of thousands of farmers protested across the EU over rising costs, cheap imports and climate-related legislation they felt imposed an unfair burden on rural communities. Mainstream politicians fear such resentment could pave the way for right-wing and Eurosceptic parties to make gains in June’s European elections.

There is little unity on how to address the issue of wolves. Conservationists eager to build on the successes of rewilding policies are struggling to find common ground with centre-right politicians and lobby groups pushing for looser restrictions on hunting to better control populations.

The issue of human-wolf coexistence is no longer just an economic question for farmers because of livestock attacks, says Juan Carlos Blanco, a biologist and wolf expert.

“It’s now a conflict of urban against rural, of left against right . . . The wolf is in the middle of this fight.”

The wolf has had “strictly protected” status in the EU under the Bern Convention since 1979.

Under the bloc’s habitats directive, there is some flexibility for member countries to manage wolf populations depending on whether the wolf is categorised as “strictly protected” (under Annex IV of the directive) or merely “protected” (Annex V).

In northern Spain the wolf was in Annex V, meaning both hunting and culling were allowed so long as a “favourable conservation status” was maintained.

This changed in 2021, when Madrid declared wolves “strictly protected” across the country based on information and a proposal put forward by pro-wolf conservation group Ascel.

It argued wolves should be reclassified as “vulnerable” and included in the country’s list of protected species (LESRPE) because of their “scientific, ecological and cultural value”. The first part of the proposal was rejected but the government endorsed the wolf’s inclusion in the protected species list.

The proposal was then put to a vote among the country’s autonomous regions. It passed by a narrow majority but the vote was divisive; the regions with the most wolves voted against stricter protection, while those with fewer voted in favour. Rural communities say they have been forced to live with the consequences.

“A few years ago, if there was an attack you’d tell the [local authorities] and they’d organise a hunt,” says Vada. “It could be that they kill a wolf or scare them away. But now you can’t do anything, and there are more and more of them.”

She adds that attacks were previously confined to flocks high up in the mountains. “Now they come and attack when they are grazing closer to home . . . every year it gets worse.”

Ignacio Martínez Fernández, president of Ascel, argues that there will never be too many wolves. “People have to adapt, and that’s it,” he says. “There is no reason to kill a wolf.”

Wolves mainly eat wild ungulates but they are highly adaptable animals. Around 65,000 livestock animals are attacked by wolves every year in the EU, with the highest damage reported in Spain, France and Italy. While this is a small proportion overall — there are around 60mn sheep in the EU and only 0.065 per cent are killed by wolves annually — local pressure on rural communities can be high.

But while Spain has tightened its protection of the wolf, a backlash is stirring at the EU level. While green parties have praised Europe’s rewilding efforts, right-wing politicians hold up the wolf and other wild animals as totemic of a wider division at the heart of the bloc.

“This is a sincere political battle,” says Bas Eickhout, a lead candidate for the European Greens in the upcoming election. “The wolf has become a bit of a symbol of the concerns rural communities [have about] not being understood by the urban elite.”

Von der Leyen, whose conservative political group the European People’s party has positioned itself as the voice of the farmers, backed a proposal in December to downgrade the protected status of the wolf under the Bern Convention that, if approved, would pave the way for a change to the habitats directive and give European countries more power to control populations.

The president’s decision to back the downlisting proposal was informed by a report analysing the status of wolves in the EU, written by Blanco. But there may also be personal dimensions; von der Leyen’s own pony, Dolly, was killed in 2022 by a wolf known to German authorities. The president still keeps a photograph of Dolly in her office in Brussels.

As wolves are recovering, it seems logical that the policy should be made more flexible, says Blanco, but simply moving the species from Annex IV to V is “a simplification so big, I can’t be in favour of it. Especially when they suggest it months before the EU elections. It makes you think it is driven by a desire to attract right-wing votes.”

He’s concerned that if passed, the change could remove the funding and support initiatives currently awarded to species in the “strictly protected” category. Von der Leyen’s own animus against wolves “hasn’t helped,” Blanco says, and nor has her inference that wolves could be a danger to humans. “There are many studies demonstrating that wolves are not a danger to people,” he adds.

[The timing] makes you think it is driven by a desire to attract right-wing votes

Any decision will be made at a meeting of the Bern Convention’s standing committee in December, which includes representatives from the 46 countries that make up the Council of Europe.

But first EU member states must agree that they want to make the proposal, with discussion ongoing about how the procedure should work. Spain is among the countries that do not support it, according to diplomats involved in the discussions.

Pettersson says the downlisting proposal shows that conservation has worked. But it requires a shift in approach from top-down protection to promoting coexistence at local level, she adds.

“There are legitimate concerns that some people might take the downlisting as an excuse to significantly reduce their population and undo some of the advances,” she says.

In the north-west of Spain, acceptance of wolves is generally high because they have never left. Joan Alibés, a sheep farmer in Galicia who also works as an adviser to farms, says more research and support is needed to help farmers protect their animals.

No method is ever going to be 100 per cent effective, he warns. “But studies show that when you do something, whatever it is, it will reduce attacks.”

For Alibés, mobile electric fencing works best for his 100 sheep. He moves them to a different area of pasture every five to seven days, and keeps them in this fenced enclosure with two dogs, which means they can be left safely at night.

More robust testing to understand what works and what doesn’t in different contexts is important, he says: “Every farmer works with their own system of moving livestock, so the measures we have to implement could be totally different.”

Conservationists have tried to tell farmers what to do without understanding the complexities of farming in a diverse landscape, he adds. “They say ‘if there are wolves, use Mastiff dogs’. But someone who has cows next to the Camino de Santiago [hiking path] can’t use Mastiffs, because they’ll have problems with people walking there. Or a farmer who has cows spread out across 3,000 hectares — you can’t tell them to put up electric fences.”

Guard dogs are expensive to maintain and look intimidating, especially if they bark to protect their animals. Sometimes people assume the dogs are abandoned, adds Vada in Cantabria: “They take them home or off to a shelter . . . I don’t know how they’re brave enough, because these dogs are huge.”

EU funding mechanisms exist to support livestock farmers in areas where large carnivores are present, and it’s up to member states to decide how to spend them. Many, including Spain, prioritise compensation; €18.7mn is paid per year in the EU to compensate for damage caused by wolves.

But it does not fix the problem. Xuan Valladares, a former biologist turned farmer in Asturias, says he loses a few animals a year to attacks but never reports them. “When they do eventually pay out they pay what they consider an animal is worth . . . apart from that there’s the emotional cost. Who pays for that? It’s not a question of money. We want [any] damage to be minimal and manageable.”

Farmers say there is currently too much bureaucracy involved, whether to claim compensation for attacks or to request that a wolf be culled by the authorities.

“You find a carcass of an animal and you have to prove it’s been killed by a wolf,” explains Pettersson. “Even if you can prove it, it takes a lot of time and bureaucracy to get it through.”

Valladares sees no reason why wolves would stop expanding as long as food sources are available and says controlling the population is necessary if extensive farming is going to work. When there is damage, farmers should be able to act with immediacy, he says: “Every time they attack, you give them warning, and they learn.”

“I’d ask for a bit more empathy from people,” he says. “That they understand, yes, it’s possible to have the wolf population in Europe but there should be control.”

Alibés has suffered attacks on his livestock in the past but he is wary of people talking about hunting or culling as the solution: “Am I going to go and get a shotgun and look for wolves? No, even if I killed one, there would still be wolves. It’s part of the risk I have to assume.”

Most researchers and policymakers agree that some level of lethal culling is inevitable across Europe. There is little consensus, however, on its efficacy. According to the EC report, research on targeted wolf culling carried out in Europe is inconclusive — at best it only solves conflicts temporarily.

France, for example, introduced lethal control but this did not stop wolf numbers increasing and has not been proven to reduce attacks.

People say, ‘very few animals are being attacked’, but how much does this matter to the farmer who just lost 20 sheep, whose flock has been destroyed?

In an effort to understand how coexistence should work, stakeholder groups have formed in some European countries, bringing together farmers, conservationists and residents.

Grupo Campo Grande, set up in Spain in 2016, aims to resolve conflicts through mediation. “We put a face to the problem. We don’t talk about farmers in general, we talk about ‘this farmer, that farmer’,” explains Yolanda Sampedro from the group’s mediation team. “People often talk about numbers, which can be quite cold. They say, ‘very few animals are being attacked’, but how much does this matter to the farmer who just lost 20 sheep, whose flock has been destroyed?”

Wolves are just one more challenge for many pastoral farming communities “already at the limits of survival”, says Sampedro. “A problem like the wolf can push them into giving up and closing their farms.”

Alibés fears the burden of working out how to coexist successfully with wolves in different contexts will continue to fall on farmers. “Brussels isn’t going to tell us how to do it, we have to do it ourselves. But we need support in this battle.”",A coyote stands in a natural setting with greenery and yellow flowers in the background.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BDA7896C0>,2024-05-27 04:00:36.608000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/1123962e-fd66-4e2b-aff1-8bc15a0890e3,['Politics' 'Weather and Environment'],[0.85 0.65],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/6ee6a03cb6.png
a55e70e1e7,The Washington Post,‘The Apprentice’ is still Donald Trump’s proudest moment - The Washington Post,"Adapted and excerpted from “Apprentice in Wonderland: How Donald Trump and Mark Burnett Took America Through the Looking Glass.” © 2024 by Ramin Setoodeh. Reprinted with permission from HarperCollins.

Donald Trump is back in the boardroom. But as reality TV’s ultimate boss slumps in his chair 25 floors above Manhattan, the cameras are nowhere to be found.

It’s August 2021, the summer after Trump was voted out of the White House. His most adoring fans, and his most ardent detractors, probably think he’s at Mar-a-Lago or Bedminster. Yet Trump has covertly made his way back to the city he loves, and he’s agreed to meet me here at Trump Tower to relive his TV glory days. Clad in his familiar armor of a boxy suit and too-long necktie that became his trademark as “The Donald,” he’s going to travel back in time with me to 2004. That’s when his reality series “The Apprentice” became a national phenomenon, transforming Trump into an unlikely blue-collar folk hero with swagger, comedic timing and world-class negotiating chops. Trump, until then a New York celebrity who was pushing his way forward with the help of the tabloids, suddenly blew up as America’s most famous businessman.

Trump’s four-year presidency was a kaleidoscope of distortions and “fake news,” ending with an attempted coup. With years yet to go before the 2024 race, it can almost seem that the country has moved on from him. And Trump seems, for the moment, to have moved on as well. He lost his Twitter privileges because of his role in inciting the insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021. Without a platform on which to rant, in 280-character bursts, about the injustices he’s facing, Trump essentially disappeared.

But on this afternoon, he has reason to crack a smile. He’s about to do something that’s going to remind him just how powerful he used to be. He’s going to revisit some of his best exchanges as NBC’s top reality TV moneymaker, to remember a simpler time when he knew exactly what to say and when everybody, not just his partisan loyalists, looked up to him.

“There are a lot of big moments!” Trump says. I press play on an 11-minute video that I’ve edited together of key scenes from “The Apprentice.” The clips range from the three times he axed the troublemaker contestant Omarosa Manigault (he could never stay mad at her, and later made her a top aide in his White House) to crowning Joan Rivers the winner of the second celebrity edition of the series. “It is true, isn’t it?” he asks, boasting about his unique perch in popular culture. I assure him that yes, his series changed history.

The conference room that we’re in today has the generic feeling of a workspace that could exist anywhere, with a scuffed-up long wooden table, a TV projection screen, and rolling chairs. Only if you squint, though, does it resemble the boardroom from “The Apprentice.” In a way, we’re on a working set: the series was shot in Trump Tower, and Trump charged the show’s creator, Mark Burnett, hundreds of thousands of dollars to lease office space. “Okay, so we had two floors of this building — big floors! — taken up by ‘The Apprentice,’” Trump says after we watch the scene in which he first uttered the words “You’re fired!” “Down below, we had the boardroom. There were hundreds of people that worked on the show. You know, this television stuff is great. You’ll think they’ll have, like, two cameras.” He pauses for effect. “They had two cameras on every person, especially after it became a big hit, actually.”

Trump goes on to say that he improvised the catchphrase that helped propel the series into the ratings stratosphere. The show cast Trump as a no-nonsense CEO tasked with gleefully firing mediocre job candidates (and later celebrities) who couldn’t cut it in his version of the high-stakes world of corporate America. “When I said, ‘You’re fired!’ the whole building shook,” Trump says of that first episode. “Everybody, because they have so many screens, they saw what was going on in the boardroom. The place just reverberated. People were screaming. They were shouting. The crew! The makeup people! Everyone was watching it. There were hundreds of them, and they went crazy.” He sounds like a retired high school football coach, lounging in a diner in the middle of the day, rewinding the clock on his favorite plays.

As a storyteller, Trump can struggle with facts, the chronology of events and what exactly he accomplished as president, but the details of that day from more than 17 years ago flow freely. “In fact,” he says, “they had to stop the tape. They had to get them to shut up, because you can’t have that. Although” — Trump seems to imagine the sound of a crew cheering for him again, right now — “they could have left it; it would have been interesting. But the people in their homes went crazy too! Because that first night, when it aired, that first show, I got calls from people that I hadn’t spoken to in years. They said, ‘That was the most unbelievable show!’”

As he crisscrosses through time, his brain misfires. Even he can’t accept that a version of himself existed that was once broadly uncontroversial and popular. “So, it actually got very good reviews, which is hard for me, because they hate to give me good reviews,” Trump says. “I got unbelievable reviews. Now, that was before my political days, okay? You know.”

Trump makes a face like a toddler being forced to eat his vegetables. If this were a scene from a reality show, the producers might cut to a confessional booth where Trump would look into the camera and admit that he regretted running for president and that starring in “The Apprentice” was the best job he’d ever had. Of course, on “The Apprentice,” Trump, unlike the contestants, never gave confessional interviews. By issuing commands and beheading the unworthy, he was simply the voice of God.

He squints at me from across the room.

“Go ahead. Show me another one.” And so I play another clip, and another one, and another one.

I first started talking to Donald Trump in 2004 as a 22-year-old Newsweek reporter covering “The Apprentice.” Most celebrities employ a publicist to field their interview requests, but such a system proved too bureaucratic — and perhaps too costly — for Trump. Instead of going through a PR flack, I’d call his office at Trump Tower, and his secretary would patch me through to his desk (or cell phone) so quickly that Trump wouldn’t even stop to ask which publication was on the other line.

When I announce in the press that I’m writing this book, Trump reaches out to me through his office, offering to be the first person I interview. Given the circumstances — that he’s a former U.S. president engulfed in scandal — I expected that I’d need to work much harder to track him down. Once we get started, he keeps extending our time together, which would spill over into follow-up appointments. “Okay, so why don’t we do another meeting?” is how he’d usually end our sessions. Sitting across from him with my prepared list of questions, I have no way to contain our conversations just to “The Apprentice.” He haphazardly swings from one monologue to the next.

A question about a contestant cascades into a defense of his leadership as POTUS, and then he swings back to the 2000s again. On some days, I have the feeling he has no idea whom he’s even talking to; at our second meeting, he tells me he couldn’t remember sitting down with me, even though it was only a few months earlier. “That was a long time ago,” he says. (Reached for comment last week about Trump’s memory, his communications director, Steven Cheung, provided this response: “President Trump was aware of who this individual was throughout the interview process, but this ‘writer’ is a nobody and insignificant so of course he never made an impression. After recognizing the importance of The Apprentice and its significant cultural impact on a global scale, this ‘writer’ has now chosen to allow Trump Derangement Syndrome to rot his brain like so many other losers whose entire existence revolves around President Trump.”)

Each time we meet is another chance for Trump to drum up press for himself, to prove that he still matters. And there is something about talking about “The Apprentice” that soothes him. “If this comes out right, it’s such a great thing,” Trump explains. “The true story has never been told.”

For my first interview in May 2021, I take a car to Trump Tower. The stillness on Fifth Avenue reflects the widely held belief by most New Yorkers that Trump has permanently fled their city. There are no crowds to mark his presence, in the form of MAGA fans or curious tourists. The skyscraper that shields him from a Manhattan that no longer wants to be associated with him has its own history — most notably as the recurring co-star of “The Apprentice” and the site of the escalator that he famously rode down in 2015 to announce his first run for president.

In that spring and summer, he looks lonely, a shadow of a famous person. He seeks validation from even the tiniest groups of humans, assembled in his office on any given day, badgering his adviser Jason Miller or deputy communications chief Margo Martin to voice their approval aloud as he tells stories about how much better he’d be than “Sleepy Joe” (President Biden) or how unfairly the media treats him. In other ways, for all that he’s visibly aged, the presidency hasn’t fundamentally changed him, not as a man, nor as an interview subject who’d never learned how to listen in a conversation. He pivots to his vendettas and lashes out about his many enemies, from Anthony S. Fauci to the MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell to the “Will & Grace” co-star Debra Messing. “She’s brutal,” Trump hisses, admitting that he’d spent time in the White House closely monitoring the Twitter account of a sitcom actress.

If you’ve ever said a negative word about Trump, chances are you’re on his enemies list. The Clintons, Obamas and Bidens of course haunt Trump’s thoughts every day; the intensity of the hatred is unusual, but at least it can be explained by their being his political adversaries.

On one of my visits to Trump Tower, I cued up a clip of Kim Kardashian making a cameo on “The Apprentice” in 2010, in order to promote her signature fragrance line. In the scene, Kim mentions that her sister Khloé sends her best, even though Trump had fired her from “The Celebrity Apprentice” the year before. This early meeting of members of reality TV dynasties led to friction for all involved. And while at first Trump seems nonchalant while talking about the Kardashians, he grows increasingly frustrated.

“Yeah, I never got along great with Khloé,” Trump says, immediately attacking her looks and character. “There was little chemistry.” (Women who did well on “The Apprentice” often fawned over Trump, even on the celebrity version; Khloé never seemed that impressed by him.) “Khloé was arrested” — in 2007— “for drunken driving. Did you know that?” Trump flashes a smug look at his ability to recall this piece of compromising information. “I think it’s a terrible thing — so many people die with drunken driving. You don’t hear about it, but they do.”

Trump is once again claiming, as he did on “The Apprentice,” that he fired Khloé because she’d been arrested for drunken driving one year before filming his reality show. But this excuse contradicts a 2016 Huffington Post story alleging that he actually axed her because of her weight. According to the story, published just a few weeks before he was elected president, sources who worked on the show recalled that Trump referred to Khloé in derogatory language such as “piglet” and called her “the ugly Kardashian.” The story ran after a presidential debate in which Hillary Clinton had reminded America that Trump, as owner of the Miss Universe pageant, mocked the 1996 winner as “Miss Piggy” when she gained weight.

Even now, Trump can’t stop himself from commenting on Khloé’s appearance. “She looks so much different today,” Trump says. “I saw her fairly recently.” He searches for the right word. “Better! She looks better. It was just her time to be fired. It’s hard to be on a show like that. You’re with other people who are very smart. I mean, some of these contestants are vicious. I’d watch it go on, and they were ferocious.”

Trump zeroes back in on his target. “And some weren’t. Some were eaten alive. Khloé was quiet.” He asks to go off the record, but rather than offer some Kardashian tea, he simply mumbles.

Then the conversation turns to Kim, who, in 2018, visited him in the Oval Office and persuaded him to grant clemency to a woman named Alice Marie Johnson, who was serving life in prison for a 1996 arrest for cocaine trafficking. The trip was, of course, chronicled for the cameras on her hit E! reality series “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.” For a made-for-TV president, being merciful — something not in Trump’s nature — was a small price to pay for the reward of the spotlight (Jared Kushner brokered the meeting, in an attempt to give his father-in-law some good publicity).

Kim returned to Washington for another gathering with Trump in early March 2020, bringing along Johnson and other women whom she’d help free from prison as part of her criminal justice efforts. Kardashian had the good luck of coming into her activism at a moment when the White House was occupied by a president who was obsessed with celebrity culture and was happy to receive her. Because of the access Trump gave her, and the success of her passion projects, she walked a fine line in avoiding criticizing him. “I have nothing bad to say about the president,” Kardashian said to Jimmy Kimmel in 2018. “I’m very grateful. I’m very hopeful more good things will come out of our meeting.”

But Trump now believes that Kim betrayed him by celebrating Biden’s 2020 win on Twitter and posting three blue heart emojis next to a picture of Biden and Kamala D. Harris. “I was disappointed in Kim,” Trump says. “I get along with her fine. I got along with her then-husband”; infamously, he’d struck up a bromance with Kanye West. “In fact, he endorsed me” — in 2016, even though West later said he didn’t vote — “and all that stuff. But with Kim, I did a lot of prison reform that she couldn’t get done with anyone else. Then, in order to be accepted by Hollywood, she didn’t endorse me. I heard …” He corrects himself. “Somebody told me she did not endorse me.”

He shifts back in his chair. “Now, I’m a very strict person when it comes to drugs.” Trump says of Johnson. “I don’t think these were really hard drugs, and there was a question as to whether or not she was using. I did a very good thing. People liked it very much.”

I never know when our afternoons together will end. There is always the possibility that if things went extremely well, Trump could keep talking at me through dinner, and maybe I’d have to excuse myself to escape from him.

“So do you think I would have been president without ‘The Apprentice’?” It’s a question that Trump asks me in every conversation we have. He offers a different answer depending on the day. “I say yes,” Trump announces in our first meeting, after a dramatic pause. “But some people say no. Many smart people say no.” He hedges, considering how much to acknowledge that he had some assistance in his rise to power. “It helped me a little bit, probably.”

Trump compares himself to Marlon Brando and Clint Eastwood and notes that the latter star, whom he calls a friend, moves with the same macho swagger in real life that he did as Dirty Harry. “It’s sort of not acting,” Trump says. “It is what it is.” Eastwood, of course, never achieved office higher than the mayoralty of Carmel-by-the-Sea, Calif., but the organizing principle remains the same: what makes a celebrity, to Trump, is charisma, which can’t be taught. “Look,” he concludes, “you either have it or you don’t have it for television.”

When we discuss this topic again a few months later, Trump is stuck on coming up with an answer. “I guess it was great for my brand,” he says about the show. “The theory is they” — millions of Americans — “got to know me, because they didn’t really know me. Mark Burnett and Jeff Zucker, those two main characters, they either get praised or blamed for me becoming president. Mark Burnett says without ‘The Apprentice,’ I wouldn’t have been president. I never spoke to Zucker about it.” (Representatives for both Burnett and Zucker declined to comment.)

As the president of NBC Universal, Zucker coddled Trump and treated him like a TV star as big as Jennifer Aniston. Later, as the boss of CNN, Zucker pumped him up as a Republican candidate in the early days of his run, airing his rallies live as “breaking news” events before the two had an ugly falling-out. As for Burnett, Trump was an important cog in his reality TV empire, and the two operated as one entity, splitting profits from the show. Even now, it’s hard to know where the mirage of him began and where it ended: Was Trump a self-creation, or made for TV by Burnett?

Trump suddenly gets quiet, revealing something that he’s never said before. “Maybe I wouldn’t have run if I didn’t do ‘The Apprentice,’” Trump says. “You know, that’s a little bit of a different thing. I might not have run.”

bebc93ea53,National Review,Tim Walz Nods along as an Interviewer Calls Him a Veteran of Afghanistan - National Review,"Early this morning, Phil Klein pointed me to a video, which I had not yet seen, of then-congressman Tim Walz nodding along to C-SPAN’s Greta Brawner as she introduces the Minnesota representative at the start of an interview. In this March 2016 sitdown, Walz’s biographical information and military résumé are read back to him, and in it, Brawner describes Walz as having “served with his battalion in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.”

In the clip — you can watch the entire 45-minute interview here — Walz nods affirmatively when he is described as a member of the House Armed Services Committee and as a member of the Veterans Affairs Committee. He nods affirmatively and smiles when the audience is told that he is “the highest ranking enlisted soldier to ever serve in Congress.” And then, after a slight pause, Walz nods affirmatively when he is described as having served in Afghanistan with his battalion, the 1-125th Field Artillery of the Minnesota National Guard.

Walz, as we all now know, did no such thing.

What makes this clip especially alarming to me is the fact that, as anyone who has appeared in television interviews knows, biographical details such as those read by Brawner about the two congressmen are almost always provided to the interviewer by the interviewee or are, at the very least, verified by the individuals being interviewed before the cameras roll. Indeed, in the few TV appearances that I have made in my capacity as a National Review editor, I have been asked to provide a brief biographical introduction to the show’s producers, including relevant details about my own military service when I discussed a military-related matter such as the war in Ukraine.

How is it then possible that this blatantly inaccurate statement made it on to the air? I am very skeptical that Greta Brawner made up that detail out of the blue. That’s not how these things work. In fact, at the close of the introductions, as Brawner transitions to the topic at hand (proposed Obama-era reductions in the manning levels of the Armed Forces), Brawner tells the congressmen, “I read that” — i.e., the written biographical introductions — “because I want to preface our discussion with your military careers because you two are trying to stop President Obama from drawing down the Army.”

Why did Walz not immediately stop and correct the record when he was described inaccurately as a veteran of the Afghanistan war? The whole point of the recounting of the congressmen’s military careers and résumés was to give the two men credibility when discussing matters of military concern. Shouldn’t Walz therefore be a stickler about making sure that information was accurate in order to safeguard his credibility?

Yes, it’s true that at the 6:50 mark of the interview, as part of a longer soliloquy about frequent deployment cycles for U.S. forces, Walz mentions how his “Guard unit backfilled to Europe to provide the security mission as the 173rd [Airborne Brigade] moved to Afghanistan,” but he never corrects the record about his service, or lack thereof, in Afghanistan.

It’s especially galling, in my opinion, that this incident happened in a joint interview in which Walz was sitting next to New York’s Chris Gibson, a retired U.S. Army colonel and a man who faithfully served his country on four combat deployments and earned a Purple Heart, four Bronze Stars, and a Combat Infantryman’s Badge.

I don’t know about you, but if I had been sitting next to such a man to discuss matters concerning our armed forces, and a national TV audience was told that I had served in a combat zone when I had not, I would explicitly correct the record.

All week, I have grown increasingly perturbed by what can only be called a nearly two-decade-long pattern of sloppy and arguably mendacious mischaracterizations of Tim Walz’s service record in which Walz, Walz’s various political campaigns, and members of the press have consistently promulgated inaccuracies.

The editorial board of NR laid out many of the details this week, writing:

From the beginning of Walz’s political career, Walz and his campaign staff have been loose with their characterization of Walz’s overseas-deployment record in a way that seems intended to leave the uninformed with the impression that Walz served in a combat zone.

Usually, these statements have been phrased in ways that could be plausibly defensible if Walz had been pressed on them. His 2005 press release, for example, states that Walz served overseas “including an eight month deployment during Operation Enduring Freedom.” On other occasions, Walz has said that he deployed “in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.” These statements, referring to Walz’s 2003 deployment to Italy, are of course technically true, but it’s easy to see why some veterans would complain that Walz’s statements are intended to obfuscate the reality of Walz’s service and imply that Walz spent time in Afghanistan.

That editorial goes on to lay out how, over the years, there has been an ongoing pattern of friendly journalists calling Walz a veteran of combat zones, variously, in Iraq or Afghanistan.

Again, how is it that all of these mistakes happen in the same direction? Why is there a consistent pattern of third parties, acting in good faith, getting the idea that Walz has served in a combat zone? Why did C-SPAN’s Greta Brawner think that Walz had served with his battalion during the war in Afghanistan?

Of course, the through-line of all these incidents are conversations and interactions with Tim Walz himself.

It is my general philosophy to assume incompetence rather than malign intent whenever something goes wrong in public life. It should go without saying that such a standard should be applied across the board — both to those whose politics I might find simpatico and for those on the other side of the aisle.

For this reason, I have strained to give Walz the benefit of the doubt in the controversy over his military service. But it is getting increasingly hard to believe that the widespread inaccuracies and mischaracterizations about Walz’s record are merely a series of unrelated misunderstandings that have nothing at all to do with Tim Walz.","A man in a suit with an American flag pin on his lapel is speaking into a microphone, with a crowd in the background, some holding signs.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x131 at 0x7D6BA3BBE140>,2024-08-10 22:18:51+00:00,https://www.nationalreview.com,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/tim-walz-nods-along-as-an-interviewer-calls-him-a-veteran-of-afghanistan/,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.75],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/bebc93ea53.png

Why These 15 Young Voters Aren’t Rushing to Kamala Harris Like Their Peers

Why These 15 Young Voters Aren’t Rushing to Kamala Harris Like Their Peers

“How can you be so negative to Harris and be undecided voters?” Frank Luntz asked 15 young Americans the other night, with a mix of exasperation and curiosity. Then, a half-hour later, as one 24-year-old dwelled on the Jan. 6 attacks, Mr. Luntz asked, “How can you be an undecided voter when you say Trump should never get anywhere near power?”

For the final 11 weeks of the presidential race, Times Opinion is doing something new: We have assembled a panel of 15 undecided voters between the ages of 18 and 27 and will check in with them regularly through Election Day to track their opinions of Kamala Harris, Donald Trump and the issues and news that matter most to them.

We’re zeroing in on young voters because they are often stereotyped or overlooked as elections get down to the wire, and because they are a potentially decisive group in swing states such as Michigan. And with many younger Americans supporting Ms. Harris, we were curious why these 15 voters in particular were more ambivalent about her. In 2020, five of our 15 voters supported Joe Biden; two voted for Mr. Trump; seven didn’t vote (all but one of them was too young); and one wrote in Mitt Romney. The Harris campaign told Times Opinion they are aiming to win over first-time voters and some Republicans.

The participants are wary of Ms. Harris right now — they say she is too far left, and that she covered up President Biden’s aging issues — and want to know what she would do about inflation, public safety and the Israel-Gaza war. But they are also skeptical of Mr. Trump, and many of them were appalled by his behavior on Jan. 6, 2021. Several saw Mr. Trump more positively after the assassination attempt on him last month, but they were quickly turned off by his verbal attacks on Ms. Harris and her race.

So, as Mr. Luntz asked, why are they undecided? What became clear is that these 15 Americans grew up in a really negative time, and they care deeply about their country but are worried about it, and don’t want to see the White House in the wrong hands.

“I’m undecided because policy matters, but so does respecting the institutions and systems that got us here as a country,” said Chris, a 24-year-old from Florida who described himself as a Reagan Republican. “It’s important that we not give in to people who want to destroy those.”

We’re curious to see whether Chris and the other 14 voters change their minds from now until Nov. 5, and whom they decide to vote for. We hope you’ll follow along, too.

None of you said 9 or 10. Can you explain why none of you have extreme optimism?

Lillian, 27, Va., white, digital advertising, voted Trump in 2020

I’m a new mom. My husband and I also bought a house. The economic challenges around owning a home, they’ve just been really difficult.

Chris, 24, Fla., white, law student, voted Trump in 2020

I’m a law student. Things tend to be very expensive. It seems like you have to have a high income to buy a starter home.

McLane, 25, D.C., white, legal field, wrote in Romney in 2020

The economy and crime don’t make me super optimistic. I live in D.C. There are plenty of shootings. It does not feel safe as a woman to walk around.

Jack, 22, N.Y., white, underwriter, voted Biden in 2020

I recently graduated and had a tough time going into the workforce. I come from a generation that is plagued by tragedy, whether it’s going into college during the pandemic, lots of gun violence when I was in elementary and middle school, economic turmoil.

Tell me why these numbers are so bad.

George, 21, Ga., white, student, didn't vote in 2020

Our country isn’t being run by people who have our best interests in mind, whether that’s politicians suggesting tariffs or other measures.

Pierce, 26, N.C., white, sales, didn't vote in 2020

No matter who wins, we’re screwed. When we wake up on Nov. 6, half the country is going to be pissed.

Mark, 24, Calif., Black, chef, voted Biden in 2020

Before Biden dropped out, you had someone who wasn’t cognitively there. On the Republican side, you have a felon who only seems interested in rehashing 2016 and 2020. No matter who wins, the divide and risk of political violence is only going to get greater.

Jasper, 25, Calif., biracial, food service, voted Biden in 2020

That’s so short-term. You guys can only see four years in the future. What do you think about the actual future-future, like for the rest of our lives?

Pierce, 26, N.C., white, sales, didn't vote in 2020

I still think it’s damaged. Our children will have to grow up in the country and the climate that we create today.

Jack, 22, N.Y., white, underwriter, voted Biden in 2020

The temperature in the country has been put up so high.

Julia, 18, Calif., white, student, didn't vote in 2020

I feel like the country became very divided when Covid happened. People would attack you and were so, so blatantly disrespectful if you felt even slightly differently. And people getting canceled left and right for having beliefs that were just slightly different than everyone else’s.

Abigail, 23, Va., white, graduate assistant, voted Biden in 2020

But that’s because we don’t want to be united, right? I went from an eight about my own life to a four about the country because I don’t see long-term institutions being built up, like the family and public schools, where diversity of opinion is normal.

Moderator, Frank Luntz

What is the most important issue that’s going to determine who you’re going to vote for in November?

Moderator, Frank Luntz

Are these issues being discussed or not in the presidential race?

Mark, 24, Calif., Black, chef, voted Biden in 2020

I want specific details on inflation. Trump doesn’t really give specific details. And Kamala was a vice president under Joe Biden when inflation went up.

McLane, 25, D.C., white, legal field, wrote in Romney in 2020

I think Trump cares a lot about looking tough on crime, but I feel like when he’s actually pressed for specifics, he doesn’t offer anything.

Joseph, 24, S.C., white, high school teacher, voted Biden in 2020

It’s just a bunch of buzzwords at this point.

Jack, 22, N.Y., white, underwriter, voted Biden in 2020

I totally agree with Joseph.

Chris, 24, Fla., white, law student, voted Trump in 2020

I think the biggest problem with the Harris campaign is that there’s not any set policies being put out. We don’t know if she’s going to run the same as she did in 2020, which was very left.

Ben, 20, Mich., white, student, didn't vote in 2020

In terms of antisemitism, I feel like this is the first election where Jewish Americans have to vote first as Jews and second as Americans, because it’s gotten so unsafe over the last year.

Jasper, 25, Calif., biracial, food service, voted Biden in 2020

For the first time in American history? You actually believe that?

Julia, 18, Calif., white, student, didn't vote in 2020

That’s kind of why I’m undecided. I’m also Jewish. The climate has become very, very unsafe. You want to make sure that you are also voting for the good of your own community and your own people.

I was in college last semester. There was an encampment. I’m someone of Jewish faith myself, and the climate is just very frustrating on campuses. Any civilian tragedy is a tragedy. No one should have to die. But it’s been twisted, it’s gotten out of control, putting Israel at fault. People at a music festival got brutally murdered by savages. Some were raped. And now there’s being accusations that people were lying about being raped. It makes me scared to even talk about it in public and just be Jewish in public, because you go around these encampments and they’re very confrontational.

Julia, 18, Calif., white, student, didn't vote in 2020

One of my friends was assaulted at Columbia. Burning the United States flag, defacing a lot of public property and vandalizing and breaking down buildings — not only is it antisemitic, anti-Israel, it’s very anti-American as well.

Mark, 24, Calif., Black, chef, voted Biden in 2020

I support speaking up for the Palestinian cause. The assaults, the encampments, I don’t support all that. I support speaking up for the Palestinian cause, but all the violence and all the other stuff, I’m not for.

Jasper, 25, Calif., biracial, food service, voted Biden in 2020

I’m across the street from U.C.L.A., and I have a friend who was there as a kind of medic who got brutally beat up by counterprotesters. Later the police showed up, not to get the counterprotesters but to start rounding up students and putting them in jail. I feel like that’s an affront to free speech. They should be able to protest, even if I don’t like the way they’re talking decolonization in a way that I don’t agree with and being very pro-Hamas.

George, can I ask you how you see it?

George, 21, Ga., white, student, didn't vote in 2020

You can clearly see how well Mossad could have taken care of a lot of these issues instead of Israel going in with a hammer and smashing everything to pieces. But it’s both sides in the wrong, clearly.

Ben, 20, Mich., white, student, didn't vote in 2020

Israel’s conducting a just and good war. Also, we don’t know the true numbers because Hamas and the U.N., which is a completely untrustworthy organization, are reporting death tolls.

Mark, 24, Calif., Black, chef, voted Biden in 2020

The Oct. 7 attacks were wrong. I’m not defending that at all. But the methods and the lengths that Israel’s gone to in the aftermath are extreme. When you’re bombing journalists, residential areas, schools, there has to be a number. It can’t just be Israel just gets to keep on killing, killing, killing until they decide the war is over and enough is enough. At some point you have to take a stand and say that is wrong.

Moderator, Patrick Healy

Do you support a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians? Two states, a state for Israelis, a state for the Palestinians. [Five people raise a hand in favor; eight people raise a hand against.]

McLane, 25, D.C., white, legal field, wrote in Romney in 2020

I was in Israel this March, and it was really interesting to talk to people both on the right and the left. A two-state solution is great theoretically, but a lot of Palestinians don’t believe in Israel’s right to exist.

Laura, 20, Md., white, legal intern, didn't vote in 2020

I support the two-state solution. I think we’ve seen that these two people are clearly at the brink. They’re dealing with a lot of violence and it’s leading to this genocide.

Moderator, Frank Luntz

How do you talk about politics in general and elections in particular with your friends? How do these conversations go?

Laura, 20, Md., white, legal intern, didn't vote in 2020

It usually starts from a simple question. There might be a news article that comes out and we’re like, well, what did you think about this? I try to be respectful of the other side. You might disagree with someone, but you can still try and understand their opinion, and most times it leads to really civil and understanding discussion.

Moderator, Frank Luntz

Laura, the people you have conversations with — are they more open-minded or close-minded overall, and why?

Laura, 20, Md., white, legal intern, didn't vote in 2020

I’ve had people at work tell me before that I’m too young to be taken seriously with my political views. And then friends or professors tell me that everything I say is completely adequate.

Mark, 24, Calif., Black, chef, voted Biden in 2020

I think the key to having a good discussion is being willing to concede points from the other side. If you give one concession early on, a lot of times, that opens up good dialogue.

Moderator, Frank Luntz

I want to know about the impact of social media on your generation and how you engage in politics.

Pierce, 26, N.C., white, sales, didn't vote in 2020

People are evil on social media. They hide behind keyboards. They can say whatever they want with no repercussions. Recently I’ve gotten death threats for things that I’ve said on social media.

Moderator, Frank Luntz

What did you say?

Pierce, 26, N.C., white, sales, didn't vote in 2020

I said that Donald Trump getting shot was probably going to be the reason why he was going to win.

Moderator, Frank Luntz

And they said to you what?

Pierce, 26, N.C., white, sales, didn't vote in 2020

That I was promoting violence by that logic.

Is social media a positive or negative when it comes to the 2024 election? [Two people raise a hand to say it’s positive; eight people raise a hand to say it’s negative.] Explain why it’s positive.

Ben, 20, Mich., white, student, didn't vote in 2020

I’m originally from the San Francisco Bay Area and I barely met a conservative person growing up. But on social media I got to interact with conservative people, hear their viewpoints, and I actually think it made me more sound in what my opinions are.

Abigail, 23, Va., white, graduate assistant, voted Biden in 2020

I wouldn’t know about a lot of things that have happened without Twitter or X, right?

Jack, 22, N.Y., white, underwriter, voted Biden in 2020

I agree with Abigail. You can find certain news things and just unedited clips compared to the regular mainstream media.

Ayshah, 21, Iowa, South Asian, student, didn't vote in 2020

I feel like there’s a lot of conflict and there’s a lot of misinformation. There can be a lot of bubbles. And then you don’t see the real picture unless you do, like, actual research.

Moderator, Frank Luntz

I want to ask you now about the mainstream media. The newspapers and the networks. Are they giving you the information you need to know to make the right decision? [Five people raise a hand in favor; ten people raise a hand against.]

Laura, 20, Md., white, legal intern, didn't vote in 2020

OK, I hate to be callous, but it’s so hard to trust anything right now. Most articles come from a place of bias.

Abigail, 23, Va., white, graduate assistant, voted Biden in 2020

They haven’t been reporting on Kamala Harris not taking any questions. She’s running for president and it’s like she’s not even running for president.

Jasper, 25, Calif., biracial, food service, voted Biden in 2020

I’ve seen news articles on that.

Abigail, 23, Va., white, graduate assistant, voted Biden in 2020

Now The New York Times editorial board comes out and says that Biden’s old. We knew that. We knew that for years. I wanted to trust them. I really did. The Biden age thing was a turning point where I felt like I couldn’t trust the media in the way that I had before and I wanted to. So how am I supposed to trust them to cover Kamala Harris when they just asked Biden to step out?

Mark, 24, Calif., Black, chef, voted Biden in 2020

I think politics has become such a profitable business in so many of these networks. Fox is a conservative network; CNN, MSNBC, that’s the liberal network. They’re incentivized to tell people what they want to hear so they can keep those people coming and make profit.

Lillian, 27, Va., white, digital advertising, voted Trump in 2020

I would like someone to talk about what Kamala Harris did in the Senate. I’m very tuned in to all of the different news networks and I get all the news alerts on my phone. And I really don’t get any substance. It’s just bickering and fighting back and forth.

I say this as someone who voted for Biden in 2020 — the tone they take toward Trump, it’s a lot more hostile, a lot more negative compared to Kamala Harris, which is a lot more positive and free-flowing.

Abigail, 23, Va., white, graduate assistant, voted Biden in 2020

I voted for Joe Biden in 2020. You really saw journalists do their jobs during the Trump administration. They’re not asking the tough questions that I saw them asking Trump.

Mark, 24, Calif., Black, chef, voted Biden in 2020

I think it’s just personal reasons. Trump insults them. They have no incentive to be nice to him.

I’m undecided between Trump and R.F.K. Definitely not Kamala.

Moderator, Frank Luntz

Is R.F.K. Jr. a factor in anyone else’s decision who to vote for?

George, 21, Ga., white, student, didn't vote in 2020

It’s R.F.K. or Trump.

Moderator, Frank Luntz

And what’s a deciding factor there?

George, 21, Ga., white, student, didn't vote in 2020

Just likability and honesty.

Moderator, Frank Luntz

And who are you leaning toward now?

George, 21, Ga., white, student, didn't vote in 2020

R.F.K.

Moderator, Frank Luntz

Pierce, you’re between R.F.K. Jr. and Trump. What’s the deciding factor there?

Pierce, 26, N.C., white, sales, didn't vote in 2020

I think strength. Before the assassination attempt, probably R.F.K. But after seeing him stand up like that, I would say Trump.

Moderator, Frank Luntz

People can’t see what you just did, Pierce. What did you just do?

Pierce, 26, N.C., white, sales, didn't vote in 2020

The fist when he said “fight” three times with blood pouring down.

Moderator, Frank Luntz

And that had an impact on your preference?

Pierce, 26, N.C., white, sales, didn't vote in 2020

Absolutely.

Moderator, Frank Luntz

Why?

Pierce, 26, N.C., white, sales, didn't vote in 2020

It’s the true American spirit to get back up after we fall down. It reminded me of when the towers fell on 9/11. You had the flag standing.

Moderator, Frank Luntz

Joseph and Ben, you’re nodding your heads. When Trump put his fist in the air with blood coming down, did that have an impact on what you think of him?

Ben, 20, Mich., white, student, didn't vote in 2020

Absolutely. It kind of humanized him in a way that I hadn’t really felt about him before, just because he’s been so vilified by the media and everything. And the fact that a few days later he appeared in public in front of a national TV audience, I mean, he got shot at and kept going. That resolve is inspiring and made me feel like he actually wants to fight for this country more and more, that he’s willing to take a shot for us.

Joseph, 24, S.C., white, high school teacher, voted Biden in 2020

I feel like that’s when Donald Trump went from more or less a footnote to something historic. And just something in me, to see him with that American flag in the background with his fist up, sort of made me want to run through a wall for him. Before that, there was no shot I was going to vote for him. I was leaning Biden. But just that American spirit, that pride.

Julia, 18, Calif., white, student, didn't vote in 2020

The way that he reacted felt very pro-American. Something like that happens and he just gets up like everything’s OK and he keeps going. You want that for your country, too.

Chris, 24, Fla., white, law student, voted Trump in 2020

Yeah, when I saw the shooting and I saw him pump his fist, it was kind of emotional. After the shooting, he says he’s going to be uniting and he’s going to tone down the rhetoric. Where has that gone? Out the door. And now he’s back to his normal rehashing 2020 and questioning Kamala Harris’s race.

Jack, 22, N.Y., white, underwriter, voted Biden in 2020

I totally agree with Chris. I had a more positive opinion of him post-shooting. But the last few weeks have just been a disgrace. I don’t think any average American cares about Kamala’s race. We care about policies, how are you going to make America better.

Moderator, Frank Luntz

Anyone else want to comment on Trump’s behavior over the last three weeks?

Ben, 20, Mich., white, student, didn't vote in 2020

It’s kind of been, let Trump be Trump. I don’t like that. I feel that his campaign is headed in the wrong direction and could be emblematic of his next administration, just all over the place.

Mark, 24, Calif., Black, chef, voted Biden in 2020

I think it’s really shameful, but I didn’t think she wanted to have a Jewish vice president on the ticket. And he has his own personal ambitions.

Moderator, Patrick Healy

So many Americans in college or in their 20s are vibing with Kamala Harris. When you see people your own age getting swept up with Harris, does that affect you?

Jasper, 25, Calif., biracial, food service, voted Biden in 2020

I see people calling her, like, the fun aunt and really falling for that. I think that she’s probably better than Biden, but I’m also not wanting to vote for her.

Moderator, Patrick Healy

Why not?

Jasper, 25, Calif., biracial, food service, voted Biden in 2020

Well, I don’t feel comfortable voting for someone unless I have a positive reason to, and if I feel like they’re leading the country in a positive direction. Being a fun aunt isn’t enough.

Ayshah, 21, Iowa, South Asian, student, didn't vote in 2020

A lot of people around me are happier that we have a younger Democrat candidate. And she is definitely more able-minded than Biden. I see some of their viewpoints.

Moderator, Patrick Healy

What does Harris need to do to win you over?

Ayshah, 21, Iowa, South Asian, student, didn't vote in 2020

Her views on foreign policy and education and health care — I just want to hear what she has to say before I make a final choice.

Jack, 22, N.Y., white, underwriter, voted Biden in 2020

I’m just going off of her own record as vice president. She was appointed to be the border czar. And I know there’s now backpedaling, but it’s on record. And our illegal immigration right now is a disaster. I’m for more legal immigration, but illegal is just not the way to go. I live right near New York City and they’re having significant budget cuts as a result.

Joseph, 24, S.C., white, high school teacher, voted Biden in 2020

Vibes are great, but vibes aren’t going to pay for my rent or pay for the groceries that are going up. There’s just so much unknown.

Jack, 22, N.Y., white, underwriter, voted Biden in 2020

She’s also on record of flip-flopping in terms of health care. She was for Medicare for All at one point, now she’s for a private option. So I don’t know what to think of her options in terms of health care.

Moderator, Frank Luntz

How many of you dislike Donald Trump? [Fourteen people raise a hand.] So what is this, the lesser of two evils, basically?

Jack, 22, N.Y., white, underwriter, voted Biden in 2020

One hundred percent. I think it’s very telling that Ivanka Trump has completely distanced herself from him.

Chris, 24, Fla., white, law student, voted Trump in 2020

Donald Trump betrayed his oath of office after the 2020 election. He has no business being around power ever again based on his actions leading up to Jan. 6, on Jan. 6, and his actions and rhetoric afterwards. Frankly, I would borderline call him a traitor to this country for putting together a scheme to overturn what his own administration officials said was a free and fair election.

Moderator, Frank Luntz

How can you be an undecided voter when you say Trump should never get anywhere near power?

Chris, 24, Fla., white, law student, voted Trump in 2020

Because I agree with almost all of his policies outside of his election fraud claims. I can’t vote for a noninstitutional Democrat who is willing, potentially, to abolish the filibuster, pack the Supreme Court and implement policies that are totally contrary to my views.

Jasper, 25, Calif., biracial, food service, voted Biden in 2020

You’re a conservative with a backbone.

Lillian, 27, Va., white, digital advertising, voted Trump in 2020

I don’t understand Trump’s philosophy on how he makes decisions, which makes it hard for me to trust him. And I don’t understand his foreign policy. I feel like he makes decisions based off of the deals that he cuts. The thing that I have the biggest problem with Trump is that he tends to surround himself with a lot of really far-right people.

Moderator, Frank Luntz

OK, then why aren’t you voting for Harris?

Lillian, 27, Va., white, digital advertising, voted Trump in 2020

I think she’s too radical for me. And like, Trump is not too radical for me. But the people he surrounds himself with are.

Laura, which one scares you more, Trump or Harris?

Laura, 20, Md., white, legal intern, didn't vote in 2020

I think that’s why I’m here. Both scare me. I think that if Trump won, there will be an uproar. I think that if Trump doesn’t get elected, there’s going to be an uproar. But I don’t know Harris well enough to answer because Harris hasn’t been answering questions. So I don’t know enough about her to say if she’s going to cause harm or not. I want to learn more about her before I can vote for her comfortably.

Jasper, 25, Calif., biracial, food service, voted Biden in 2020

Neither of them scare me because I’ve lived through years of Trump. And I also think that Kamala Harris is probably going to be similar to Joe Biden and Barack Obama.

Is there anyone who sees climate change as one of the top two issues in deciding which candidate to vote for in November? [No one raises a hand.] And then just in terms of the economy, who here is struggling with student debt?

Pierce, 26, N.C., white, sales, didn't vote in 2020

I have $30,000 in student loan debt. Luckily, with Biden’s SAVE Plan, I haven’t had to shell out an arm and a leg to pay it back. So I do give credit where credit is due. But that is not one of my top issues.

Chris, 24, Fla., white, law student, voted Trump in 2020

I’m in law school right now and I’m taking out student debt. And I’m already looking at jobs for after graduation. Starting salaries are certainly going to have a big say in what kind of law job I’m going to take. I don’t think student debt forgiveness is a good policy. I just view debt as a self-accountability issue.

Is anyone so burdened by student debt that it’s changing the direction of your life in your 20s?

Abigail, 23, Va., white, graduate assistant, voted Biden in 2020

Well, I would like to have children in my 20s, but I’ll be paying for my husband to go to law school. And so that means I have to delay that, something I really regret.

Donald Trump, if you do get a second term, stop the divisiveness and please bring unity to the country.

Donald Trump, shut the hell up and focus on the issues and stop worrying about the petty stuff, like Kamala’s race. Nobody cares.

Lillian, 27, Va., white, digital advertising, voted Trump in 2020

On Jan. 6, I lived five streets away from the Capitol. I was right there when it happened. It scared me. And I really did not like seeing Trump on camera saying, march down to the Capitol. I think he did incite violence. I’m having a hard time voting for him because of it.

Chris, 24, Fla., white, law student, voted Trump in 2020

I think that the reporting is very clear that Trump asked Mike Pence to unilaterally overturn the election using phony legal theories by his attorneys. And thank God that we don’t live in Venezuela, where Maduro overturned an election overnight. It’s not necessarily the riots itself that make me angry, but what Trump pressured Pence to do, which would have had a substantial impact on the country. That bothers me a lot.

Jack, 22, N.Y., white, underwriter, voted Biden in 2020

We have a process in this country, the peaceful transition of power. You can appeal to the court if you want. Trump had more than 60 court cases, and he didn’t fulfill his oath to the Constitution. He can say all he wants that it was a peaceful march to the Capitol. The images say otherwise. And then, his rhetoric saying to go home, we love you, you’re very special. I think it’s a terrible thing to say to people who try to break in and destroy democracy.

Abigail, 23, Va., white, graduate assistant, voted Biden in 2020

Trump never called the National Guard to protect the American Congress from a mob. Someone else had to do it. How can I vote for someone like that?

Mark, 24, Calif., Black, chef, voted Biden in 2020

Donald Trump’s insecurities caused him to make the entire thing up that the election was stolen. And to see an entire party unite around one lie that one man told because he was too insecure to accept the loss, and to see how great of power he had over people — that’s pretty scary that one man can have that much power over a group of people.

Laura, 20, Md., white, legal intern, didn't vote in 2020

It’s frightening to see that partisanship has gotten to the point that it can actually lead to violence and that people don’t believe in elections. I worry it’ll happen again.

I’m a Reagan Republican. I would have loved to see Ron DeSantis. I know he shares some of the Trumpian views in some sense, but I don’t think he’s ever said that the election was stolen. I mean, that’s a huge, huge, huge issue for me. I want Donald Trump held criminally accountable for what he did after the election. But at the same time, I agree with his policies, and there’s still a chance I vote for him. It’s insanity.

Abigail, 23, Va., white, graduate assistant, voted Biden in 2020

I’m a Republican that voted for Joe Biden in 2020 because I wanted someone to heal the soul of our country. And I don’t think that Biden did that. I don’t think Harris would do that. I don’t think Trump would do that. I don’t think any president will do that until we decide to unify. I will vote for Democrats if I think they’re competent and have good ideas.

Jasper, what would it come down to for either Harris or Trump to get your vote?

Jasper, 25, Calif., biracial, food service, voted Biden in 2020

It’s going to come down to just what meets my needs and the needs of people I care about.

Moderator, Patrick Healy

When you say you’d vote for someone else, do you have someone in mind?

Chris, 24, Fla., white, law student, voted Trump in 2020

If I were to vote today, I would write in Mitt Romney. I know I said I rooted for Ron DeSantis in the primary. But ultimately, I think Mitt Romney would be a unifying candidate. There’s a small chance that Donald Trump could win my vote if Kamala goes way to the left on policy.

Moderator, Patrick Healy

Is there anything Harris could do that makes you think she could win you over?

Chris, 24, Fla., white, law student, voted Trump in 2020

If Harris decided to come out and have nearly identical policies to Biden, including on Israel and things of that nature, and Donald Trump continued to go on an unhinged campaign for the next three months, I would be open to voting for Harris.

Moderator, Patrick Healy

Mark, how about you? Do you have someone in mind?

Mark, 24, Calif., Black, chef, voted Biden in 2020

Maybe a third party. Kamala Harris could get my vote by coming up with a plan to actually combat inflation, not just saying, I’ll end inflation. Two, my big thing is the war in Gaza and Israel. If you can pledge to either come up with a different plan or halt arms sales to Israel, you can have my vote.

Moderator, Patrick Healy

Angelo, I’m going to give you the last word on this.

Angelo, 19, N.Y., Latino, college worker, didn't vote in 2020

Honestly, I would do a write-in, either Gov. Josh Shapiro or Gov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia. It seems like they both actually care about people and the issues. We saw it with the attempted assassination on Trump — Josh Shapiro condemned it. He talked to the wife of the victim who was shot. He actually cares about the people.

Moderator, Patrick Healy

Can you imagine how either Harris or Trump could win your vote?

Angelo, 19, N.Y., Latino, college worker, didn't vote in 2020

Harris, just stop flip-flopping and just be honest, and Trump, tone down the rhetoric, just stop the whole divisiveness and bring unity.","A black and white illustration of four individuals with obscured faces, set against a plain background.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x117 at 0x7D6BC77F9090>,2024-08-22 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/22/opinion/young-voters-focus-group.html,['Politics' 'Opinion/Editorial'],[0.9 0.9],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/6ea4c76c4a.png
f18442234d,Financial Times,Bundesbank chief calls for German tax cuts to boost investment - Financial Times,"The head of Germany’s central bank has urged the government to cut taxes, reduce bureaucracy, boost the workforce and increase the carbon levy to rekindle the country’s fading attractiveness to investors.

Joachim Nagel, president of the Bundesbank, said investors were increasingly avoiding Europe’s largest economy, which “lags far behind in terms of growth” in international comparisons.

While there had been “some economic bright spots” for the German economy, which returned to growth in the first quarter of this year after a year of contraction, Nagel said it was “still facing major challenges” in areas such as renewable energy that would require significant investment to address.

Addressing a conference in Frankfurt on Monday, he cited a recent study by development bank KfW that found Germany would require about €5tn of investment to achieve its goal of climate neutrality by 2045.

But he said corporate investment had been declining recently and there was “widespread concern that investors were increasingly avoiding Germany”. The structural problems deterring investors included high wage and energy costs, a shortage of skilled workers, uncertainty over regulation and a high tax burden, Nagel added.

To encourage more clarity on the need to shift to a carbon-neutral economy, Nagel said the government should increase its carbon levy from current levels of €45 a tonne. “Carbon pricing should be applied as broadly, uniformly and predictably as possible,” he said.

He also suggested reducing taxes, adding that Germany’s high corporate tax rates compared unfavourably with its international peers. “To create an employment and investment-friendly environment, it is important to keep an eye on the tax burden on labour and capital.”

The Bundesbank president said the government should clear the regulatory “traffic jams” stemming from slow and cumbersome bureaucracy, adding this was “clearly evident in the expansion of renewable energies, for example in wind turbines”.

To boost the labour supply to the many sectors suffering from shortages of skilled workers, Nagel said the government should tap into a “hidden reserve” of about 3.2mn people who want to work but cannot as they have to care for children or do not think they will find a suitable job.

Warning the government against relying heavily on financial incentives such as the tens of billions of euros it has offered to chipmakers to build new semiconductor plants in Germany, he said that “we must be careful not to get caught up in the thicket of subsidies”.

Nagel said trying to attract investment with subsidies was “often fraught with bureaucracy, increasingly complex government interventions and a constant burden on public finances” and could risk companies postponing investment in the hope of winning state handouts.

“I am convinced that if Germany is to move on to a higher growth path, there is no way around more investment,” he said. “Politics can remove hurdles in many areas, but not all of them.”

Nagel said more than half the companies cutting investment last year cited Germany’s “poor macroeconomic environment” as a factor driving their decision in a Bundesbank survey. It also found that the share of German businesses reducing investment was similar to the share that increased it.

A study of international competitiveness by Swiss university IMD last month found that Germany had lost ground, dropping two places to 24th place out of 67 countries ranked.

The German economy grew 0.2 per cent in the first three months of the year compared with the previous quarter. GDP fell 0.3 per cent last year, making it the worst-performing major economy.

Economists expect consumer spending to pick up after rapid rises in wages and a slowdown in inflation boosted household purchasing power. Data released on Monday showed German inflation fell slightly more than expected from 2.8 per cent in May to 2.5 per cent in June.

Services inflation remained high, with prices in the sector rising by 3.9 per cent year on year in June — the same rate as the previous month.","A bustling street scene with a crowd of people, some on bicycles, in front of a tall, modern building with a distinctive spherical top, and a bridge in the background under a clear blue sky.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA4A8AE00>,2024-07-01 15:03:10.341000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/9c6a9c57-fcab-4ef4-8b8b-9d57f74238c1,['Business and Finance' 'Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85 0.8 ],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/f18442234d.png
4ca012357a,The Guardian,England’s GPs are squaring up to the government – but it’s an unnecessary battle | Polly Toynbee - The Guardian,"GPs in England have embarked on industrial action for the first time in 60 years. The 10 actions they can choose from could bring the NHS to a grinding halt. Their ballot result, announced last week, blew the lid off a boiling pot as 98.3% voted for collective action against the impossibly inadequate budget increase of 1.9% awarded to practices by the previous government. This is a warning about a service on the point of collapse, they say. The lack of GPs is so alarming that the health secretary, Wes Streeting, last week announced plans to recruit more than 1,000 GPs this year as a “first step” emergency measure, after arriving in office and saying bluntly that “the NHS is broken”.

Some of the media slammed the GPs. The Mail found one earning £700,000 – who probably ran many clinics – but average GP pay in 2021/22 was £118,100. Why they have become the whipping boys of the right is hard to fathom when, by any measurement, they are among the most hard-pressed and the most productive staff in the NHS, with an increase of 6.4 million patients registered with a GP in England since 2015.

Anyway, the industrial action is not primarily about pay, but funding to keep a service running that provides up to 90% of all care, and whose share of the NHS budget has fallen to its lowest in eight years at only 8.4%. Though the last government promised 6,000 more GPs in 2019, the number has instead fallen while their workload has increased by 20%, with far more difficult cases. England spends less and has fewer doctors and GPs per head than almost any other EU15 country.

The Tory vote crashed partly due to public satisfaction with the NHS falling to its lowest ever, at just 29%. Yet 71% of people in England still rate their own GP experience highly. Hospitals under intense pressure have cut their outpatients departments, sending back to GPs most patients needing treatment for diabetes, mental health and other specialist care. That’s euphemistically called “shared care”, but it’s done almost entirely now by GPs. Sick patients suffering on long waiting lists for operations fill up extra GP appointments, while people living longer lives need more GPs to care for the old with multi-morbidities. “My beautiful profession is collapsing,” says Prof Dame Clare Gerada, a south London GP and recent president of the Royal College of GPs, sounding near to despair. “We get 30p per patient per day, less than the cost of an apple.” She is a patron of Doctors in Distress, a charity for reducing suicide among doctors, so she sees their anguish. She and Dr Phil Hammond are at the Edinburgh fringe, drumming up support for saving the NHS.

The threat of work-to-rule industrial action includes the eye-catching warning that GPs might cut the number of patients they see to only 25 a day. Forty a day is typical, usually. The BMA lists 10 “actions” GPs can choose to take, such as stopping data sharing with third parties, no longer seeking advice and guidance before referring patients to specialists, and other minor spanners to throw into the NHS system.

The key demand is a new contract that reflects what GPs do now. Every recent review shows that the present Carr-Hill formula for allocating funding, drawn up based on the 1991 census, fails to take account of deprivation. The complex set of hundreds of indices that dictates how GPs are reimbursed doesn’t support poorer areas to reach high vaccination and smoking cessation rates that are easily reached in wealthy places, says Gerada. GPs’ most radical demand is for a big shift of NHS funding out of hospitals into GP clinics and their community services.

Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of the BMA GPs committee and its chief negotiator, talks to me of GPs “leaving in droves” while innate NHS forces suck money into hospitals, leaving less and less for the services that best keep people out of them. The mighty power of consultants and the political fear of growing hospital waiting lists override all evidence that prevention, public health and community treatments are the best hope for improving the health of the nation. She is demanding a 1% funding shift every year from hospital to community, so that in five years, primary care will get 5% more.

She’s quite right. But here’s the oddity of all this. That is exactly what Labour thinks, and has always said. It’s there in the manifesto and in every speech Streeting makes. So why, after only a month, is the BMA taking action against a new government that’s on their side? I detect a certain sheepishness about this as GPs I have talked to are less than certain it makes sense. Nor does it sound as though many will take any action that patients would notice. The fury and despair about being unable to deliver a good enough service, and the strain of the hours and the admin, are genuine enough. This all began in March with a referendum among GPs long before the election was called.

Streeting’s team tells me their approach to GPs is: “Take a breather. The people on the other side of the table have changed in everything we believe. We completely understand why GPs wanted to give the last government a kicking. We’re not combative, we’re in complete agreement.” Streeting and his officials have met Bramall-Stainer several times. Frankly, she doesn’t sound to me as though she’s itching for a fight. They all sound likely to fetch up around a table promptly, talking about a major shift from hospital to community that Streeting has already sent out advisers, such as Prof Lord Ara Darzi, to report back on by next month.

As promised in the election campaign, Streeting settled with the junior doctors’ leaders rapidly. But recent waves of NHS strikes since 2022 among nurses, hospital doctors, physiotherapists, paramedics and others led to nearly 1.5m appointments, procedures and operations being postponed, costing the NHS an estimated £3bn – a stubborn act of grandstanding insanity by the last government when staff had suffered real pay cuts. An actual strike by GPs would be even more catastrophic. But as GPs well know, that would risk causing far greater public alarm, indignation and suffering to patients, which is why these opening salvoes are no more than an SOS distress signal, so far.

In a curious repetition, the last time GPs took action was on the arrival of Harold Wilson’s government in 1964, when they handed in mass resignations, undated, as a threat. It was settled. Negotiating a new contract that reflects the complexity of work GPs have been landed with by hospitals – and the extra services they want to provide to shift care into the community – looks set to be difficult and drawn out. At least both sides start out on the same side of the table, but don’t underestimate GPs’ desperation.","An image from The Guardian showing two individuals seated in a waiting area, one reading a tablet and the other holding a magazine, with a caption 'The Guardian Opinions' below.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6B7DEA32B0>,2024-08-06 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/06/englands-gps-government-patients-doctors-ministers,['Politics' 'Health'],[0.9  0.85],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/4ca012357a.png
23dcc0e77a,CBS News,A top personal finance influencer wants young adults to stop making these money mistakes - CBS News,"Your Rich BFF founder Vivian Tu has quickly emerged as one of the most prominent personal finance influencers, with millions of followers on Instagram, TikTok and other social media platforms. A former Wall Street trader, the 30-year-old shifted gears after noticing that many of her coworkers from the corporate world needed help even with basic financial tasks.

Through Your Rich BFF, she now offers money advice to millennials and Gen-Zers in the places they like to get information — on social media, while also publishing a book, ""Rich AF,"" hosting a podcast and appearing on television. In an interview with CBS MoneyWatch, she dispels common money myths and outlines some financial mistakes younger adults often make. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

CBS MoneyWatch: How did you get into this line of work, and what made you think it could become a full-fledged career?

Vivian Tu: I was surprised that people who were older than me or more advanced in their careers did not know the answers to questions like, ""Can you help me rebalance my 401k, pick a health insurance plan, and understand if my company stock options are worth anything?"" I was asked the same questions over and over again, so I created content to answer them so people would stop asking me!

It turned out that a lot more people than just my coworkers needed information. We don't get this in school, and it's the one thing all of us desperately need. We would all be a lot better off if this were part of our education.

So where can people learn how to be smart about money?

Similarly to how you hold a pencil or learn to drive — you are taught by your parents and guardians. For some folks who come from generational wealth or have parents who are money-savvy, they're getting that education.

However, the vast majority of us don't come from that type of background. Our parents are imperfect, and they are imperfect with their money as well. So we pick up the same money issues our parents have. Then you turn to the internet to try to find the information yourself.

What's wrong with finding information online?

There are a lot of myths out there, especially on social media. One big myth is that investing is very exciting. It's not. It's watching grass grow or watching paint dry. If you're feeling like you're on a roller coaster, your heart rate is rising, you're excited, nervous, you're probably doing it wrong.

Investing is a great way for any person to have a dual-income household. You're working hard for money, and your money can work hard for you. You can only work so many hours before your body and brain give out, but your money can work around the clock 24/7, with no lunch breaks. At the start of your career, the hope is you are setting aside money and it will help you when you don't want to work as much or you can't.

Right. And at a recent Wall Street Journal event you noted that the algorithms that power social media can magnify content that is misguided, and even financially reckless, like ""get rich quick"" schemes. How do you make plain-vanilla investing principles appealing for the TikTok generation?

In terms of getting people to actually care, I think it's showing what that money actually looks like when it's in use. Instead of saying if you save now, you get to retire a multimillionaire at 65, say, ""At 65, you get to wake up every morning, have a lemonade, hit the golf course, live in Naples, Florida — you get to live every day without being beholden to the need to make more money."" That's more compelling than just the stats.

Meeting people where they are at, explaining why money things are important to them, moves the needle. For example, when I talked about how having a good credit score helped me earn travel rewards that I used to fly to Italy in a lay-flat seat, everyone wanted to know how to improve their credit scores. Showing responsible decision-making paying off is when people are going to actually pay attention.

What are some other money myths you think need to be debunked?

No. 1 is thinking you need to be entirely debt free. Yes, eliminate as much high-interest debt as possible, but when you have low-interest rate debt, you don't need to rush to pay it off. You can start investing while paying off debt. Not all debt is evil.

No. 2 is, don't buy things you don't need with money you don't have to impress people you don't even like. When you make a purchase, ask yourself, ""Do I want to have this, or do I want people to know I have this?""

Third, investing is not only for rich people. It's how rich people get rich. The best outcomes for average investors are buying and holding exchange-traded funds and mutual funds that track broader indices. It's about having a very diversified portfolio that is appropriate to your age and risk tolerance.

It's not what people want to hear, — they want to get rich tomorrow. If your horizon is 24 hours, there are very few investments that are ever going to pay what you need it to.

A hallmark of personal finance advice is that the choices we make as individuals determine our financial futures. But that view doesn't take into account the systemic forces that shape our financial lives, like income inequality and recurring economic crises. More recently, for example, we're seeing how the advent of artificial intelligence can suddenly transform some jobs. What's your take?

We have to come to the realization that our generation can't save our way to riches — we don't get to have the ""happily ever after,"" white picket fence house our parents had through saving. Back in the day you could work a middle-class job, earn a middle-class paycheck, buy a home, and go on vacation twice a year. It's harder now. But you have to be able to do the best with the hand you are dealt. Control what you can control and if something happens, know how to pivot.

For example, if you just earned a degree in programming and are worried about AI taking over these jobs, dive into learning how to work with AI and see how you can maintain job security. There will always have to be someone there to make AI smarter, design the system and be the engine behind it. It's not like it just exists. We need to learn to use it to our advantage versus compete. It should be a collaboration. Why not leverage it to take over the 25% of the job that you hate so it frees you up to do other things?","A woman in a pink blazer is shown with a neutral expression, looking slightly to the side.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BE1B093F0>,2024-05-24 19:39:00+00:00,https://www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vivian-tu-your-rich-bff-money-myths-finance-influencer-gen-z-millennials/,['Business and Finance'],[0.95],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/23dcc0e77a.png
59cac304ad,National Review,Jill Biden Opens Up about Hunter’s Conviction after Attending Gun Trial - National Review,"First Lady Jill Biden opened up over the weekend about her stepson Hunter’s federal gun conviction after witnessing most of the trial from the courtroom.

She told NBC News on Saturday the gun trial was “a tough week for my family,” because the Bidens “had to relive … the tough times,” referring to harrowing testimony from Hunter Biden’s exes about his crack-cocaine addiction.

Hunter Biden was convicted last week on three federal gun charges, two of them resulting from falsely claiming on gun paperwork he was not addicted to crack cocaine when he purchased a firearm in October 2018. The third charge against Biden was for possessing the firearm for eleven days while addicted to crack cocaine.

“I think after the decision in the court, Hunter was strong, and so I have to take his example and just get out there and start fighting again,” the first lady added.

The criminal trial took place in Wilmington, Delaware, and pitted different members of the Biden family against each other. The proceedings laid bare how Hunter Biden’s years-long crack-cocaine binge permanently altered the lives of those around him.

“Joe and I both respect the judicial system, and that’s the bottom line,” Jill Biden said of the verdict. She does not believe the weight of Hunter’s conviction will influence her husband’s job performance.

“Oh, no,” she said. “He is a strong man, and he is a resilient man, and he’s going to do a great job.”

Kathleen Buhle, Hunter Biden’s ex-wife and mother of his three eldest daughters, was a witness for the prosecution, putting her on the other side of daughter Naomi Biden, a witness for the defense.

Buhle appeared despondent, and struggled to remember specific details of Biden’s drug usage, except for the day she found a crack pipe on their porch in 2015.

The defense tried to use Naomi’s testimony to show Hunter Biden’s behavior changed around the time of the gun purchase, but texts introduced by the prosecution during her cross-examination undermined Naomi’s recollection of events.

Hallie Biden, Hunter’s ex-girlfriend and the widow of the late Beau Biden, also testified for the prosecution and recalled finding crack cocaine remnants in Hunter’s car when she found the firearm.

Her testimony was important for persuading a holdout to convict Hunter on his first false statement charge, as NR reported from Delaware.

When the verdict was announced, Jill Biden was not in the courtroom, and only arrived afterwards to be with her family. But, she was present throughout the trial, only leaving to go to Paris for D-Day events with her husband, President Joe Biden.

Jill was occasionally companied by her daughter, Ashley Biden, another addict in the Biden family. Ashley Biden only watched the trial for short periods of time before getting emotional and leaving the courtroom.

Additional members of the Biden family came to support Hunter during the trial, such as uncle and business partner James Biden, and aunt Valerie Biden Owens.

She and Hunter’s current wife Melissa Cohen left the courtroom with him after Hunter’s conviction. Cohen was in the courtroom for the entire trial and often embraced Hunter as they entered and exited the courtroom together.

“I am more grateful today for the love and support I experienced this last week from Melissa. my family, my friends, and my community than I am disappointed by the outcome,” Hunter Biden said in a statement following his conviction.

President Biden said last week he would not pardon his son or commute his sentence, which is set to be decided later this year. Hunter faces a maximum of 25 years in prison but will likely receive a much lighter sentence.

09004241de,Newsweek,"Woman Attends Event, Gets 'Ultimate Mansplain' Over How She Spells Her Name - Newsweek","A woman has gone viral after revealing the extraordinary encounter she had when a man tried to correct her on her own name and insisted that she had it wrong.

Cally Beaton, 55, explained in a video posted on TikTok (@callybeatoncomedian) that she was due to speak at an event earlier this month when she noticed that her name card wrongly listed her as Carry. She asked for it to be corrected, but rather than changing it, the man she spoke to insisted that Carry was correct, despite her protestations that it wasn't.

It was extremely frustrating for Beaton, who lives in London. She told Newsweek that it's all too common for people to ""doubt a woman's credibility."" She feels that this wouldn't have happened if she was male, but because she's a woman, the man chose to mansplain her own name.

Since she shared the ""ultimate mansplain"" experience on TikTok, the clip has been viewed over 425,200 times and gained more than 54,900 likes in just days.

Beaton, a comedian and podcaster, said: ""I'm a very experienced speaker, and I feel that a woman probably would not have said that to me. She'd have tried to help. Also, if I was a male speaker, I don't think that guy would have said, No, that's not your name.

""I don't think he's a nasty man and I'm not angry, but this is part of the systemic problem. It's become part of a culture, as I've had people explain my job to me, tell me how to tell jokes and now someone literally arguing about my name.""

Mansplaining is defined by Merriam-Webster as a man explaining something to a woman in a condescending way that assumes she has no prior knowledge of the topic. Its first known usage was in 2008, and it's become a popular term since.

It isn't just a popular colloquialism. A poll by YouGov U.K. revealed that 82 percent of British women had been subjected to mansplaining at some point. While 42 percent said they occasionally experience it, 18 percent reported that they face it often. Only 11 percent said they'd never experienced mansplaining.

The survey also revealed that the worst offenders for mansplaining are husbands/boyfriends/partners, as well as men at social events, all at 35 percent. Male colleagues and male friends were also reported to be culprits, at 26 percent each.

How Did TikTokers React?

Beaton regularly uses social media to discuss her real-life experiences. After presenting this ""stark example"" of mansplaining, she was astonished by the number of women who shared similar stories.

""I think it shows that there's a real community of people who've had enough of it,"" she told Newsweek. ""Lots of women have had enough of being continually mansplained to, and I think we see that. There's some humor in it, but there's also awareness and a serious point behind it. There's an underestimation of women being taken seriously, and I think what happened to me was connected to gender.""

Although the social media reaction has been overwhelmingly positive, Beaton has received some negative messages too. She said a lot of men commented and messaged her saying that she was wrong and that her ""lived experience didn't happen.""

She wasn't surprised that they thought they knew better, and she will continue sharing her stories on TikTok to connect with other women and ensure they feel heard.

The viral video has captured plenty of attention online, leading to more than 1,300 comments already. One person responded: ""The less they know, the louder they know it.""

Another wrote: ""I've had a man correct me on how to say my own last name once.""

Another comment reads: ""Wow. It's the audacity for me.""",A woman with red hair and a black jacket smiles and says 'Carry' in a video call.,<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BA5AC84C0>,2024-05-28 15:01:49+00:00,https://www.newsweek.com,https://www.newsweek.com/woman-reveals-ultimate-mansplain-over-name-1905274,['Opinion/Editorial' 'Other'],[0.8 0.6],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/09004241de.png
171ac09e2f,The Daily Beast,MAGA Artist Debuts Deranged Apocalyptic Vision of Kamala Harris Devouring Bald Eagle - The Daily Beast,"A painting depicting a laughing Kamala Harris tearing into the bloody guts of a dead bald eagle was front and center at the annual gathering of Moms for Liberty in the basement of a Washington, D.C. hotel this weekend, eliciting delight from attendees—and bemused side-eyes from online observers.

The conservative group’s “Joyful Warriors” summit, which organizers billed as “the ultimate gathering of parents fighting to defend their parental rights and improve education in America,” drew around 600 attendees over its four days of programming, according to The Atlantic.

Many “stood in awe” of the grotesque, psuedo-satirical painting, the magazine reported.

It portrayed the vice president—and Democratic nominee for president— kneeling over the bird’s bloodied corpse, gore all over her hands and mouth, a communist symbol stamped onto her jacket. Sitting on a stool in a corner in a dunce cap was President Joe Biden, an oversized knife in his back. Presumably to hammer home the apocalyptic overtones, a nuclear mushroom cloud blooms in the background.

A label underneath, per photos posted on social media, identified the work as titled “We Did It Joe” and its creator as Scott LoBaido.

Once characterized by The New York Times as “Staten Island’s most celebrated artist-provocateur,” LoBaido is a notorious MAGA activist-slash-creative known for his dozens of iterations of the American flag on canvas, as well as for occasional bouts of pro-Trump performance art. He has gifted the former president a number of his pieces, including most recently in July, when he presented Donald Trump with his rendering of the aftermath of his assassination attempt.

Earlier this week, LoBaido began hyping up his latest work on social media, announcing that it would be unveiled on Friday in D.C. In a video filmed on the road to the capital, LoBaido boasted to his audience that he was going to have to “apologize to Leonardo da Vinci in advance” of the unveiling.

“This painting, appropriately titled “We Did It Joe,” is going to be the next painting, for the next 500 years, that everybody’s going to know about,” he said. “They might not forget about the Mona Lisa, but she’s going to be in the back seat. It’s the way it is.”

In another video the next day, LoBaido pulled a blue cloth off of the painting in front of the U.S. Capitol, promising that it would “change the course of history.”

It was not clear if the original painting is for sale. (Signed 12-inch-by-16-inch poster prints, however, retail on his website for $59.) Neither LoBaido nor a representative for Moms for Liberty immediately responded to requests for comment on Sunday afternoon.

Moms for Liberty has around 130,000 members around the country. Its summit featured panels on abolishing the Department of Education and pamphlets on child sex trafficking, and was headlined by the right-wing comedian Rob Schneider and former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard.

Still, proceedings crescendoed with a Friday night appearance by former president Donald Trump, who dropped in for what The Guardian called a “long, zigzagging and at times incoherent” conversation with the organization’s co-founder Tiffany Justice. They drifted from subject to subject, discussing everything from Ivanka Trump’s clothing line to The Apprentice to Trump’s recent stop at Arlington National Cemetery.","An artwork depicts a person in a yellow coat with a hammer and sickle emblem, seemingly in a state of distress, with a bald eagle on the ground and a fiery explosion in the background.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BCA546740>,2024-09-01 22:53:55.435000+00:00,https://www.thedailybeast.com,https://www.thedailybeast.com/maga-artist-scott-lobaido-debuts-deranged-painting-of-kamala-harris-devouring-bald-eagle,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.8 ],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/171ac09e2f.png
b6142aed07,Forbes,Student Loan Payments Paused For Millions As Biden Is Poised To Slash Bills In July - Forbes,"Millions of borrowers were notified this week that they will not have to make a student loan payment in July. The Biden administration has directed loan servicers to place many borrowers enrolled in the Saving on a Valuable Education plan into a special type of forbearance in anticipation of payments getting recalculated and reduced. SAVE is a new income-driven repayment plan that often has lower payments and gives borrowers a pathway to student loan forgiveness.

“We look forward to providing millions of borrowers with lower monthly payments as part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s work to provide the most affordable student loan repayment plan ever,” said an Education Department spokesperson in an email on Wednesday.

Here’s what borrowers need to know.

Faster Student Loan Forgiveness And Lower Payments Under Biden’s SAVE Plan

President Joe Biden debuted the SAVE plan last fall. Officials have described the plan as the most affordable and most beneficial income-driven repayment plan. The program features lower monthly payments, an interest subsidy that will eliminate any future balance increases for borrowers who are underwater on their payments relative to interest accrual, and accelerated student loan forgiveness for those who took out small amounts of debt.

But the SAVE plan is about to get even better for borrowers. Starting on July 1, a new repayment formula for the plan will go into effect. This update will slash the monthly payments for undergraduate borrowers by half as the plan’s discretionary income formula is reduced from 10% to 5%. Borrowers who have graduate school loans will also see a reduction to their payments if they have undergraduate loans as well; the amount of the reduction will depend on the proportion of their graduate and undergraduate student loan debt.

Student Loan Payments Paused For July As New Formula Goes Into Effect

More than eight million borrowers have enrolled in SAVE, according to the Education Department, and many of these borrowers will have their payments recalculated under the new formula that goes into effect next month. In anticipation of this, and in an effort to avoid some of the repayment chaos that plagued the student loan system when the Covid-19 payment pause ended last fall, the Education Department has directed loan servicers to place impacted borrowers in an administrative forbearance for the month of July, cancelling any payment that would otherwise be due.

Borrowers started receiving notices this week that their servicer “has placed an Administration Forbearance on your account” from July 1 through July 31. The Education Department confirmed that the forbearances are being applied at the direction of the Office of Federal Student Aid.

“As the Department finalizes preparations with student loan servicers to implement borrowers’ new, lower monthly payments capped at 5% for undergraduate loans under the SAVE Plan, some borrowers may be placed in a brief processing forbearance to ensure they can access the full benefits of the SAVE Plan and that their new payment amounts are accurate,” said the department spokesperson. During the forbearance, “no payment is required” and borrowers’ interest rates will be temporarily set to 0%.

Forbearance Will Count Toward Student Loan Forgiveness Under PSLF And IDR

Under new regulations, mandatory processing forbearances can now count toward student loan forgiveness for IDR plans as well as for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. This is a significant departure from past practice, when these types of forbearances would not count, and borrowers could face significant setbacks in making progress toward eventual loan forgiveness.

The Education Department spokesperson confirmed that the July administrative forbearance will count toward student loan forgiveness for IDR plans and PSLF.

SAVE’s Student Loan Forgiveness And Repayment Benefits Face Legal Challenges

While the Biden administration works to implement the student loan payment reductions under SAVE, the plan is facing two serious legal challenges brought by a coalition of more than a dozen Republican-led states. The states are seeking to block the program, arguing that President Biden exceeded his authority in establishing such a generous IDR plan.

Last week, a federal judge in Kansas gave the Biden administration a partial victory in one of the challenges when he dismissed the lawsuit for eight out of 11 states. But the court allowed the lawsuit to proceed for the three remaining states associated with that legal challenge.","An older man in a suit stands at a podium with a microphone, addressing an audience with a blue background featuring the word 'SEM' partially visible.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BE1DCFF70>,2024-06-13 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.forbes.com,https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamminsky/2024/06/13/student-loan-payments-paused-for-millions-as-biden-is-poised-to-slash-payments-in-july/,['National' 'Politics'],[0.9 0.7],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/b6142aed07.png
5eba98f784,Forbes,3 Lessons For Today From The Disastrous Democratic Convention Of 1968 - Forbes,"Fifty-six years ago, the city of Chicago descended into bloody madness, and America apparently never learned its lesson because we could be headed for a repeat.

In August 1968, thousands of anti-war protesters gathered near the Democratic National Convention and surged toward lines of helmeted police bearing clubs and tear gas. The protestors called them “pigs” and threw rocks and bags of manure at the men in blue.

Chicago Mayor Richard Daley unleashed waves of enraged, unprepared, and undertrained police on the crowds, who arrested and injured hundreds. An official investigation termed their response “a police riot.”

A few days after the convention, I ran into a friend who had been an anti-war delegate. He was in high spirits. The disturbances in Chicago, he said, would catalyze the center in America and lead to the end of the Vietnam War and Democratic victory in the 1968 election.

Boy, was he wrong. Most Americans who live in the political center prefer incremental and constructive change rather than extremists' radical and destructive change.

The televised violence in Chicago in August 1968 led many Americans to conclude that the Democratic party could not control extremism and violence. In November, it was Richard Nixon, the Republican law and order candidate, who won the presidency. The Vietnam War continued for another seven years.

This summer, it is chilling to hear the glee of anticipation from far-left activists as they plan demonstrations at next month’s Democratic convention, which will be held again in Chicago. In particular, pro-Palestinian demonstrators who use phrases like “Genocide Joe” Biden and “From the River to the Sea, Palestine will be free” plan to turn the convention into a showcase for their cause.

The authorities in Chicago have said they will not let demonstrators near the convention site, and protesters continue to say they will challenge that ban. Once again, confrontation is in the air. Now, Washington and much of the country are understandably fixated on whether President Biden will continue as the party’s nominee after his disastrous late-June debate performance. But what happens outside the convention hall later this summer – no matter who the nominee is – could profoundly shape the election in November.

Of course, most Americans today have no memory of the election year 1968. But it offers important lessons. Here are three that people may want to consider as the party conventions approach later this summer.

1. The party that seems most in the thrall of extremists is the most likely to lose the White House.

This is true for Democrats if their convention devolves from a show of party unity into a street confrontation between radicals and the police.

However, Republicans, who hold their national convention in Milwaukee in July, should also be aware of this. Some in the MAGA right are just as provocative and off-putting as the leftist radicals of 1968, and their calls for revenge and retribution against Democrats could quickly turn off key swing voters. Studies find a disconcertingly high share of Republicans predicting the coming of a second American civil war or justifying the use of violence when it comes to specific political issues. That is scary talk, even more so when you consider the horrific events of January 6, 2021.

Those right-wing extremists echo the YIPPIE leader Abbie Hoffman in 1968, who enflamed an already tense city by falsely claiming the YIPPIEs were going to put LSD into Chicago’s water supply system.

Many voters at the time – including the mayor of Chicago – took such rhetoric literally.

2. Americans are fed up with extremism and hungry for commonsense solutions to their problems.

Polling over the last twenty years shows that a growing share of Americans believe our major political parties are becoming too extreme. According to an Economist/YouGov poll in June, only 24 percent of Americans believe the country is on the right track, while 68 percent believe the country is moving in the wrong direction.

While much of Washington obsesses over scandals and investigations, Americans are laser-focused on the issues that directly impact their wealth, health, and well-being. A recent Gallup Poll asked Americans what issues concerned them most and found those issues were inflation, crime and violence, hunger and homelessness, the availability and affordability of healthcare, and the unsustainable budget deficit.

The high cost of groceries, housing, and mortgages is far more likely to stimulate voters than whatever the extremists are raging about on cable news on any given day, and there is growing evidence voters have reached their breaking point with the radicals in Congress: Last month, Rep. Bob Good – the chair of the far-right Freedom Caucus – likely lost his Virginia Republican primary (he’s contesting the results). Meanwhile, left-wing firebrand Rep. Jamaal Bowman lost his New York Democratic primary, just as his “Squad” compatriot Mondaire Jones did in 2022.

3. It may feel good to you. But are you helping others?

So much of American politics has become performative, dominated by people for whom political action provides personal pleasure so thrilling that they keep on doing it even when it hurts their cause.

An excellent example of this destructive behavior came in November 1969, when half a million anti-war protesters gathered in Washington, DC. For most participants, the goal was to convince the public and Congress to end the Vietnam War.

But a small contingent of confident radicals in the crowd took down all the American flags surrounding the Washington Monument. They replaced them with the flags of the communist Viet Cong.

That begged the question: How many American voters were going to be moved against the war by images of a communist takeover of Washington DC?

The radicals’ political actions were little more than selfish pleasure-seeking. They enjoyed themselves but undermined the cause they claimed to be fighting for. Passion and pragmatism don’t have to be at odds. In early 1968, liberal supporters of Senator Eugene McCarthy famously launched their “Get Clean for Gene” campaign, in which they cut their hair and beards to create a more broadly appealing image to the American public. Too many activists today seem to prefer bullying, intimidation, and other tactics that seem tailor-made to turn off large swaths of their fellow Americans.

I hope we avoid that kind of extreme politics at the party conventions this summer and in the campaign this fall. Whichever party is most effective at marginalizing the radicals on its own side and focusing on the issues Americans really care about will likely win the White House in November.

After all, we are a country of centrists and part of the greatest democracy in the world's history.

7a8b2adef2,Newsweek,Moment Kitten Hiding by Garbage Can 'Chose' Passing Dog to Be Her Savior - Newsweek,"The bond between a dog and the stray cat who ""chose"" him to look after her has melted the hearts of viewers online.

Levi, the Belgian Malinois mix, had spotted the cat while on a walk with his owner. Little did he know that the cat had decided that he would be her unlikely savior. A touching video, shared by the dog's owner under @thedoggolevi, showcased the remarkable moment when a tiny stray kitten, hiding by a garbage can, developed an attachment to Levi, who ultimately nursed her back to health.

The clip, which was shared to TikTok on July 23, has been liked by more than 555,000 users and viewed over 2.4 million times.

Viewers were able to see Levi spotting the stray kitten sitting behind a wired fence while on a walk in Brooklyn, New York City. An overlaid text read that ""the cat distribution system chose my dog."" Despite her precarious situation, the kitten remained remarkably calm around Levi, who approached her gently. As the video progresses, viewers could witness the blossoming bond between the pair, as they were filmed cuddling and spending time together.

Levi's owner detailed in the caption that they found the kitten, who weighed just 1 pound at the time, under a garbage can wheel. Despite her small size and initial circumstances, the kitten was in relatively good condition. Levi, sensing the young animal's vulnerability, took on the role of her caretaker, and the two quickly became inseparable. The kitten, now named Brooklyn, has since been adopted by Levi's owner's sister and is said to be doing well.

""She was [1 pound] when she chose Levi to be her caretaker,"" the dog's owner said. ""She was healthy and in relatively good condition, despite being found under a garbage can wheel. These two were inseparable, two peas in a pod.

""She was adopted by my sister, who named her Brooklyn, where she is still happy and healthy!"" Levi's owner added.

This heartwarming narrative of an unexpected friendship and rescue has resonated deeply with viewers, many of whom have praised the dog's compassionate nature in the comments section.

dbb40b48cf,The Globe and Mail,U.K. prime minister pitches ‘standing army’ of police to deal with rioting across Britain - The Globe and Mail,"British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Monday that a “standing army” of specialist police would be set up to deal with rioting and that the justice system would be ramped up to handle hundreds of arrests after violent disorder rocked cities across the nation over the past week.

Mr. Starmer convened an urgent meeting after lawlessness he blamed on “far-right thuggery” that was driven in part by misinformation on social media that whipped up anger over a stabbing rampage at a dance class that killed three girls and wounded 10 people. False rumours spread online that the suspect was a Muslim asylum-seeker led to attacks on immigrants and mosques.

“Whatever the apparent motivation, this is not protest. It is pure violence and we will not tolerate attacks on mosques or our Muslim communities,” Mr. Starmer said. “The full force of the law will be visited on all those who are identified as having taken part in these activities.”

On Sunday, angry mobs attacked two hotels used to house asylum seekers, breaking windows and lighting fires before police dispersed the crowds and residents were evacuated. Dozens of police officers have been hospitalized for injuries in the past six days after being struck with bricks, bottles and large wooden posts.

Why are there riots occurring across the U.K.? What to know about the violent clashes, arrests and more

More than 375 people have been arrested in the mayhem so far and more are expected, the National Police Chiefs’ Council said.

Many made court appearances Monday and found themselves facing at least several weeks behind bars awaiting their next court hearing.

Deputy District Judge Liam McStay in Belfast Magistrates’ Court refused bail for two men who had participated in a march that trashed businesses and set a supermarket on fire in the capital of Northern Ireland. He said he couldn’t allow that to be repeated and “visited on other people.”

“The events at the weekend were absolutely disgraceful: a concerted and deliberate attempt to undermine public order and to then domineer the community and there were racist elements to it,” Justice McStay said. “The message has to be if you allow yourself to become involved in these matters for whatever reason, then you will face the consequences.”

Mr. Starmer’s plan to beef up the criminal justice system and deliver quick justice faces significant challenges as courts are already backed up and prisons are so overcrowded that plans were already in the works to release inmates early, said Cassia Rowland, a senior researcher at the Institute for Government think tank.

“That’s not a problem you can fix overnight and it’s going to be difficult, I think, for the system to cope with the influx of demand that we’re likely to see as a result of this disorder,” Ms. Rowland said.

Mr. Starmer has dismissed calls to reconvene Parliament to deal with the crisis or send in the army. His office said police can handle the disorder.

In the meeting with ministers and top law-enforcement officials, Mr. Starmer said social-media companies have not done enough to prevent the spread of misinformation that has fuelled far-right violence and vowed that anyone who stokes the disorder – online or on the streets – could face prison, a spokesperson said. Some of that false and misleading information has come from foreign states.

“The disinformation that we’ve seen online attracts amplification from known bot activity, which, as I say, can be linked to state-backed activity,” a Starmer spokesperson said in a readout of the meeting.

Mr. Starmer’s office condemned Elon Musk, owner of the social-media platform X, for responding to a post of footage of the violence by saying: “civil war is inevitable.”

“There’s no justification for comments like that,” the spokesperson said. “We’re talking about a minority of thugs who don’t speak for Britain.”

Near Rotheram, in Northern England, where a violent mob on Sunday stormed a Holiday Inn Express where migrants were housed, throwing chairs at police and setting a fire, a crowd of volunteers showed up Monday to help clean up the mess.

Police guarded the building as glass from broken windows was swept up. A wooden fence behind the building had been destroyed by men who tore off planks of wood and hurled them at police.

“I’m horrified. I’m appalled by the violence that we saw yesterday,” Oliver Coppard, the mayor of South Yorkshire, said. “We saw a violent far-right mob come down to attack 240 of the most vulnerable people in our society and try and burn them in the hotel in which they were living. That is not okay and there is no excuse for it.”

In Southport, where rioting first broke out July 30 – the day after the horrific stabbing there – police said only one child remained in the hospital. The seven other children and two adults who were seriously injured had been discharged.

A vigil was held Monday to remember the three girls killed at the Taylor Swift-themed dance class: Bebe King, 6, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9.

Hundreds of parents and children gathered around bouquets of flowers and stuffed animals outside The Atkinson arts centre in memory of the girls. As a piano played, children blew iridescent bubbles that hung and swirled in the air before they were gone.","A man in a suit and tie is walking with two other individuals, one of whom is holding a book.

219aea37d0,CNN,What to watch at the Republican National Convention this week - CNN,"After surviving an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania, Donald Trump will be at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this week to accept his third consecutive GOP presidential nomination.

A gathering already marked by one kind of uncertainty, with Trump’s vice presidential pick still a mystery, will now take place under the shadow of one of the most shocking acts of political violence in modern American history.

It’s unclear what effect the bloodshed will have on what had been expected to be a week of pomp and prime-time speeches designed to make the GOP’s best case for Trump and a Republican majority on Capitol Hill. Trump, though, has already promised the show will go on – at the Fiserv Forum and Wisconsin Center District, Milwaukee’s convention center campus – and that he is “look(ing) forward to speaking to our Great Nation this week from Wisconsin.”

Here are six things to watch:

What will change because of Saturday’s shooting?

Many of the questions that predated Saturday evening’s assassination attempt have largely faded into the background as Trump, President Joe Biden and their respective allies rush to adapt their campaigns to the new landscape.

It’s not yet clear how this contest has been altered, but what begins on Monday with the delegate roll call and concludes Thursday night with the former president’s nomination acceptance speech, clearly marks the start of something new and fraught.

“Honestly, it’s going to be a whole different speech now,” Trump told the Washington Examiner of his convention speech following the assassination attempt.

“This is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together. The speech will be a lot different, a lot different than it would’ve been two days ago,” he said.

Trump’s return to the stage, which could come earlier in the week, and his rhetoric at the podium will set the tone both for the final months of the presidential campaign and the near-term future of American politics. The former president has, so far, been restrained in his response to the attempt on his life. Other members of his party have not, with some immediately suggesting – without evidence – that the alleged gunman was driven to act by heated campaign rhetoric.

Trump’s campaign leadership has also said, in a Sunday memo, that it will not tolerate violent rhetoric.

How the presumptive GOP nominee decides to translate his feelings could spark an already crackling tinderbox – or, if he seeks to turn down the temperature, further add to the conundrum for his rivals, who are unsure of how – and when – to resume their campaign against Trump.

For now, though, the ball is very much in the former president’s court.

What the hosts are saying

Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Brian Schimming told reporters on Sunday that, as of now, there are no major changes on tap for the convention or its schedule.

“If they were to make any changes, there would be a reason for it, but we don’t see any reason for it right now,” Schimming said.

Trump’s vice presidential pick is still slated to speak on Wednesday, followed by Trump on Thursday. The slate of speakers is unchanged.

Schimming said he spoke to RNC Chairman Michael Whatley earlier in the day and “everything for the convention is going on as planned.”

“We have dozens and dozens of speakers that will be speaking not only to the folks here, but to people across the nation and across the world about what Donald Trump’s gonna bring to this country,” Schimming continued. “We want to make America great again, and the way to do it is to have a unified convention here in Milwaukee.”

VP: Who’s it gonna be?

The decision has been made, Trump recently said, “in my mind.” But for just about everyone else, it remains a mystery.

CNN previously reported that the Trump campaign viewed Monday, July 15, as its deadline for naming a running mate. That is, of course, the first day of the convention. The potential for a made-for-TV unveiling is there – and it’s likely down to three people: North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance.

The timeline, though, could be thrown off by the shocking attempt on Trump’s life this weekend in Pennsylvania. The former president, before the Butler County rally, was using the announcement as a tool for drawing out small-dollar donors and media attention. Both are now keenly attuned, no matter whom Trump picks for the ticket, possibly changing his calculus.

The Trump campaign previously said its “top criteria in selecting a vice president is a strong leader who will make a great president for eight years after his next four-year term concludes.” Does that rule out Burgum, the only senior citizen in the trio of favorites? Rubio and Vance are younger, but the job description might be different today than it was yesterday.

One piece of evidence the pick was, at the very least, nearing? According to copies of the invitations, the Trump team has scheduled two large donor events during RNC week in Milwaukee featuring his as-yet-unknown running mate.

Will MAGA make a case to the moderates?

The better question here might be: Do Trump and his MAGA crew want to win over fence-sitting Republicans who, as an example, voted for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the GOP primaries?

They want the votes, of course, but what’s less clear is whether the former president and current GOP leadership are willing tone down their message in an effort to bring in moderate, suburban voters. To that end, Haley has indeed been invited to speak.

How the party, more broadly, addresses hot-button issues like abortion is more of a question mark. Former Vice President Mike Pence, a social conservative, has already expressed concern over too soft a stance. Democrats will, for all the other issues at play, be hoping for some fire and brimstone from conservatives like North Carolina gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson.

A handful of 2024 rivals-turned-supporters are scheduled to speak. Among them: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose campaign fizzled after a second-place showing in Iowa.

Other 2024 contenders, including South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Burgum, who have aligned themselves closely with Trump and are on the list of potential vice presidential picks, are also likely to be on hand.

Presidential conventions are generally geared toward reaching – via television – the broadest possible spectrum of potential voters. Trump, though, is more inclined to tweak his political rivals than offer them an olive branch.

For almost 10 years now, since he entered the presidential arena in 2015, political strategists and pundits have been asking if Trump – first as a candidate, then as president, and now, again, as a candidate – might saw off the roughest edges of his persona in a bid to attract swing voters.

He’s done so, on occasion, for brief periods of time. That’s been his tone since the assassination attempt. Which path he’ll choose for this convention – and whether he and his allies can maintain it for a full week – is harder to predict.

Family reunion

The family is very much back in focus.

Back in 2016, Trump’s children all spoke to the convention and were, in large part, viewed as bright-eyed validators for his candidacy. Four years later, they mostly took a more aggressive tone.

This time around is more difficult to peg. Their words will take on greater meaning, too, as Republicans look to Trump’s innermost circle for guidance about how to react to the shooting in Pennsylvania.

The public view of Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump and Tiffany Boulos (née Trump) has changed over the past eight years. Trump’s eldest sons have emerged as vocal supporters of his right-wing politics. His daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, is now the co-chair of the Republican National Committee. Though Ivanka, who worked in Trump’s White House, and Tiffany have been quieter, both are expected to be in Milwaukee.

As will former first lady Melania Trump, though it is unclear whether she will speak. She released a lengthy statement following the Pennsylvania rally asking Americans to “ascend above the hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded ideas that ignite violence.”

The former first lady has maintained a low profile throughout her husband’s latest campaign, having attended just two public appearances since Trump launched his third presidential bid — the kickoff of his campaign in November 2022 at their Mar-a-Lago home and a brief appearance in March when she accompanied Trump to vote in the Florida presidential primary.

More recently, she announced that their son, 18-year-old Barron Trump, will not be a delegate to the convention despite his being voted into the role in Florida.

The ‘Project 2025’ tap dance

Trump has publicly distanced himself from Project 2025, a far-reaching, 900-page conservative blueprint for the next Republican president to purge and remake the federal government and implement new restrictions.

However, that blueprint has become the focal point of Democratic attacks on what a second Trump term could look like — and for good reason: CNN’s Steve Contorno found that at least 140 people who worked in the Trump administration had a hand in Project 2025, including more than half of the people listed as authors, editors and contributors to “Mandate for Leadership,” the project’s extensive manifesto for overhauling the executive branch.

Whether Trump and his allies address Project 2025 or its most politically incendiary proposals, which are certain to feature in Democratic advertisements this fall, could offer a preview of much of the rest of the campaign.

Trump has attracted a devoted following from his party’s most conservative members — and handed them a victory they’d sought for decades when the Supreme Court’s conservative majority, with three Trump-appointed justices, overturned Roe v. Wade’s national abortion protections.

But he has sought to distance himself from those figures and put their policy beliefs at arm’s length as he approaches a general election in which he’ll need to win over moderate suburban voters with little appetite for conservative culture wars.

Another example: The panel charged with crafting and producing a platform for the Republican National Committee adopted a scaled-back document that softened language on abortion and same-sex marriage. That document will be taken up at this week’s convention.

a915d5adad,The Guardian,‘To escape Gaza is already an achievement. And then to be trans?’: the women defying national and gender boundaries - The Guardian,"The Belle from Gaza premieres at the Cannes film festival on Friday – an achievement made the more remarkable as there was a point last year when it looked as if it would never be seen.

After Hamas’s attack on 7 October and the Israeli military offensive that followed, its French director, Yolande Zauberman, considered shelving her finished project. “I thought maybe we should not show this movie for the moment, because what’s happening is so big, so huge”, says Zauberman.

Her film was not meant to be “a demonstration of anything”, but its title and synopsis alone – the story of transsexual women moving from Palestine to Tel Aviv to live out their new identities – risked being read as a political statement on the current conflict.

In Israel, gay marriage can be registered but only if it is performed abroad, and male-to-female sex reassignment surgery is carried out in public hospitals, while in the Palestinian territories homosexuality remains a taboo.

Zauberman eventually decided to show the film after the positive reactions of both Arab and Jewish viewers at a test screening. Did she consider that her film could be politicised after its premiere at Cannes? “Of course, but it’s strange, because so far that is exactly what is not happening.”

A veteran film-maker of nine documentaries and features, Zauberman, 69, chanced on her subject during the making of her César award-winning M, about an Israeli man who was raped in an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community as a child and becomes attracted to transsexual women later in life. In Tel Aviv, some of these women could be found at night on Hatnufa Street, in the south of the city, offering sex for cash.

Meeting the women, Zauberman found that many of them were Arab, and picked up a story about one woman who was rumoured to have walked from the Gaza Strip to Tel Aviv, a journey of at least 45 miles.

The story captured her imagination: “Gaza at the time was already a jail for people,” she says. “For somebody to manage to escape that jail is already an achievement. And then to be or to become a trans woman?”

In the film, which documents Zauberman’s search over almost five years of filming, the titular figure remains elusive – a smartphone photo that provides the only point of reference turns out to depict a different person altogether – and other women move into the foreground instead.

“After a while I thought, maybe it’s better not to find her, because what would we do if we find the Belle from Gaza?”, Zauberman says. “Isn’t it going to be too dangerous for her?”

For some of the women, leaving behind the Palestinian territories did amount to a liberation. One of them, Danielle, describes being beaten and ordered to run towards a checkpoint on the West Bank, with the intention of making Israeli guards believe her to be a terrorist, and shoot her.

But the picture is nuanced. Even in Tel Aviv, some of the four women appear on edge when interviewed, eyeing the shadows entering their street to distinguish potential customers from potential attackers. “They are safe and not safe,” Zauberman says. Some have the requisite papers to live in Israel, others don’t. “Above all, they are really strong. And to live their life, you really have to be.”

While some of them are fearful of being sent back to their parents (“they will kill her for sure”), others have supportive family and loyal Muslim friends.

Religion plays a surprisingly large role, even in the more secular metropolis. One woman, Nathalie, begins to wear a hijab after her operation and starts to recite from the first chapter of the Qur’an. “Religion and family is very important for them. And during the process of the movie, they become more and more religious”.

The film opens with an interview with an older, Arab transsexual woman who recalls the intense affair she once had with an Orthodox rabbi. “What interests me is that these women know Israel so well – they know everything about it,” Zauberman says. “If one day there is a sort of peace, they could play a really a big role, because they know both sides very well.”

In the run-up to Cannes, there have been criticisms of the lack of Palestinian voices at the world’s largest film festival. There are no Palestinian film-makers in the official selection, and protests along the Croisette and its surroundings have been pre-emptively banned.

“This year we decided to host a festival without polemics,” festival chief Thierry Frémaux said on the opening night, perhaps mindful of the way the conflict in the Middle East ended up dominating the awards gala at the Berlin film festival earlier this year.

In The Belle of Gaza, which has minimal narration, the Palestinian women of Hatnufa Street are given the space to speak for themselves, but there’s an argument to be had that in Zauberman’s film Gaza remains an abstraction, a cipher for a state of imprisonment – and for the world’s largest film festival, a way to turn a blind eye on a conflict that may be complex, but is also costing real human lives.

It’s an argument the festival’s curators should engage with, rather than the directors behind its films. In her 1987 debut Classified People, Zauberman told the story of a mixed-race couple in apartheid South Africa. The lesson it taught her, she said, was that for film-makers politics have to be found in the personal. “The only place, the real place of resistance, is intimacy.”","A person with a shaved head and a gold necklace stands in a crowded area with people in the background, under a streetlight.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BA23F36D0>,2024-05-16 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/16/yolande-zauberman-documentary-the-belle-from-gaza-cannes-film-festival,['Entertainment' 'Politics'],[0.85 0.75],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/a915d5adad.png
5cc83373eb,Financial Times,Tory election campaign director on ‘leave’ after gambling probe - Financial Times,"The Conservative head of campaigning has stepped back from his role after he and his wife became embroiled in a widening election-betting scandal.

Tony Lee “took a leave of absence” on Wednesday, the party said. Lee is being probed by the Gambling Commission over bets on the timing of the UK general election, according to one person familiar with the situation.

His wife, Laura Saunders, is also under investigation by the gambling regulator for allegedly betting on the timing of the election. The date of the bet and amount allegedly wagered is unknown.

Lee and Saunders did not respond to requests for comment.

Saunders is a Conservative staffer standing for election in Bristol North West. The gambling regulator also launched a probe into Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s closest parliamentary aide last week and a police officer from the premier’s protection detail was arrested this week.

“The director of campaigning took a leave of absence from [Conservative Campaign Headquarters] yesterday,” the Conservative party said on Thursday.

The scandal threatens to further damage the Tory party’s already struggling re-election effort. Several polls have predicted a catastrophic defeat for Sunak and his party at the July 4 poll.

The Tory campaign has already been damaged by blunders by Sunak, including returning early from D-Day commemorations.

“If people have used inside information to place bets, that is deeply wrong,” Michael Gove, housing secretary, told the BBC. He added that he could not “get too much into the detail while an investigation is going on” but said that in principle such activity was “reprehensible”.

Saunders has worked for the party since 2015, most recently helping to liaise with centre-right parties in other countries.

Lee previously described himself online as a political campaigner “with over 20 years experience in running elections” and said he had led the successful campaign to re-elect former West Midlands mayor Andy Street in 2021. Lee’s LinkedIn page was not active on Thursday.

He was appointed director of campaigning by deputy prime minister Oliver Dowden, who highlighted Lee’s work as the “mastermind” behind Street’s campaign at the party’s Spring Forum in March 2022.

The Gambling Commission said it was “investigating the possibility of offences concerning the date of the election”. It added: “This is an ongoing investigation, and the Commission cannot provide any further details at this time.”

The Conservative party said: “We have been contacted by the Gambling Commission about a small number of individuals. As the Gambling Commission is an independent body, it wouldn’t be proper to comment further, until any process is concluded.”

Craig Williams, who as parliamentary private secretary to Sunak was one of his most trusted aides, is also under investigation after he placed a £100 bet on a July election just days before his boss announced the date of the vote.

Sunak said he was “very disappointed” in Williams, who has admitted a “huge error of judgment” after he “placed a flutter” on the election date.

Williams has declined to say whether he placed the bet on the basis of any inside information and Sunak refused to confirm if Williams had known about the date of the poll, insisting it was not appropriate to comment while an independent investigation was under way.

Responding to the growing scandal, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was “telling” that Sunak had not suspended those allegedly involved from running as Conservative candidates in the election.

“If it was one of my candidates they would be gone and their feet would not have touched the floor,” he said on a visit to York. “Politics needs to be about service, about public service.”

On Monday, London’s Metropolitan Police also arrested an officer in Sunak’s personal security detail over “alleged bets” placed on the timing of the election.

The Met confirmed that a member of its Royalty and Specialist Protection command had been held over “alleged bets”, without identifying whom he guarded. A person familiar with the situation confirmed he had been part of Sunak’s protection detail.

6b498bdeac,National Review,Brian Stelter Returns to CNN Two Years after Network Fired Him - National Review,"Former CNN host Brian Stelter is returning to the network two years after CNN fired him and canceled his Reliable Sources show during a time of upheaval.

Stelter announced Tuesday on CNN’s Reliable Sources media newsletter that he will be coming back as the author of the newsletter he founded.

“I’m returning to @CNN in a brand new role as Chief Media Analyst. I’ll be appearing on TV, developing digital content, and once again helming the Reliable Sources newsletter,” Stelter said on X after sending out the newsletter.

His return follows the departure of CNN media reporter Oliver Darcy, who previously authored Reliable Sources. Darcy left CNN last month to launch an independent nightly media tip sheet.

Between his CNN stints, Stelter was a fellow at Harvard’s Kennedy School and a special correspondent for Vanity Fair. He freelanced for other media outlets and continued to appear on the network occasionally, even after CNN fired him. He also appeared on BBC as a political commentator.

Stelter hosted the Reliable Sources show for the better part of a decade and became one of CNN’s better-known left-wing personalities. His partisan approach drew frequent criticism from conservatives, especially for promoting the dunked Steele dossier and leading the media campaign to discredit the Hunter Biden laptop story.

More recently, Stelter downplayed the mainstream media’s failure to adequately cover President Joe Biden’s mental decline before his disastrous debate performance in June.

Aside from that, Stelter was known for airing softball interviews with Biden-administration officials and defending former CNN colleague Chris Cuomo when he came under fire for secretly advising his disgraced brother, former New York governor Andrew Cuomo.

Former CNN boss Chris Licht’s decision to fire Stelter was part of his ill-fated attempt to shift the network’s coverage in a more centrist, less partisan direction.

Stelter was previously a media reporter for the New York Times, a position he started after graduating from college. Stelter has written two books on the close relationship between former president Donald Trump and Fox News.

“The media industry has matured, CNN has evolved, and I have changed a lot since I signed off two years ago. I loved my old life as the anchor of a Sunday morning show but, to borrow some lingo from my video game blogger days, I finished that level of the game. Time for new levels, new challenges,” Stelter said in the newsletter.

Expressing gratitude for his firing, Stelter attributed his new perspective to the opportunity he had to be a stay-at-home dad to his children and consume the news less frequently.","A man in a suit is speaking into a microphone, with a blurred face, in a room with a blue background.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x131 at 0x7D6BA4726380>,2024-09-03 23:03:59+00:00,https://www.nationalreview.com,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/brian-stelter-returns-to-cnn-two-years-after-network-fired-him/,['Politics' 'National' 'Entertainment'],[0.9 0.8 0.7],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/6b498bdeac.png
f731b2e425,Financial Times,Brookfield puts London Citypoint tower up for sale - Financial Times,"Brookfield has put London’s Citypoint tower up for sale, in the biggest test yet of the UK capital’s office market after a brutal two-year downturn.

The Canadian asset manager is seeking £500mn from a sale according to people familiar with the matter. The process comes as Brookfield faces a deadline on about £460mn of debt secured on the 36-storey building.

The debt is due in January, after Brookfield extended the loans for 12 months last winter. Brookfield has appointed advisers and sounded out potential buyers, according to people familiar with the matter.

Brookfield has not formally attached a price tag but is targeting at least £500mn, which could mean a price as much as 25 per cent lower than a March 2023 valuation of £670mn included in loan documents. Brookfield could explore financing options if the sales process fails.

The tower is by far the largest office building to be brought to the market in London this year as the commercial property market starts to recover from a two-year downturn. Green Street News first reported the sale.

Only a handful of office buildings across London have sold for more than £100mn in London this year, making Brookfield’s sale effort a huge test of investors’ appetite for these properties and what price they will demand.

The roughly £500mn that Brookfield is seeking is below the £607mn it paid to acquire the building in 2016. The firm has since invested £40mn in upgrades, boosting occupancy to 82 per cent.

Tenants include law firms Simpson Thacher & Bartlett and Simmons & Simmons. The tower, built in the 1960s initially for British Petroleum, also includes retail, leisure and storage units.

A person close to the process said Brookfield had decided to sell because the asset sits in one of its older funds, which has performed well overall and is now selling its final investments.

The fund, Brookfield Strategic Real Estate Partners I, dates from 2012 and has returned 18 per cent net IRR. It had just $533mn worth of unrealised investments as of June, according to company filings.

One of the world’s largest owners of offices, Brookfield has taken some hits from the downturn in this market as investors have grown concerned about the impact of hybrid working post-pandemic. The firm has reportedly chosen to default on some huge assets in the US rather than inject fresh capital.

In London, it co-owns Canary Wharf Group with the Qatar Investment Authority. The two investors injected £300mn of fresh equity into the docklands landlord last year, which has helped Canary Wharf Group to navigate a series of debt maturities.

18a1d0ea1c,The New York Times,"The Ecstasy, Agony and Awkwardness of the Trump Conviction - The New York Times","Darren Van Dreel, a 58-year-old electrician from Oshkosh, Wis., has followed the twists and turns of the investigations into former President Donald Trump over the years: the Mueller report, two impeachments and a flurry of criminal cases, most of which have been mired in delays.

So on Thursday evening, while he and his wife, Misty McPhee, were on a long drive from Wisconsin to the Washington, D.C., area, there was only one thing to do when the verdict came in.

“I high-fived my wife,” said a grinning Van Dreel, as he waited for a sandwich on Friday morning in the liberal Del Ray neighborhood of Alexandria, Va. “I was just so pleasantly surprised that finally somebody’s holding him accountable.”

When a Manhattan jury found Trump guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records on Thursday, Trump’s campaign declared that the country had “fallen,” and his allies painted a picture of a nation consumed by rage. His supporters flooded corners of the internet with angry imagery (more on that below), and echoed his claims that the verdict was illegitimate.

Tell that to voters like Van Dreel, a liberal-leaning independent who deeply opposes Trump, and for whom the criminal conviction felt like Christmas in May. After years of watching the investigations into Trump come to nothing in the way of legal consequences, of being maddened by his ability to evade punishment, the guilty verdict made for a rare moment of Trump-related joy, mixed with a sprinkling of “I told you so.”

“I texted my nephew — I’m not a big drinker — and said, ‘I’m having a cocktail tonight,’” said Meg Ryan, 68, a mixed-media artist and a Democrat, as she enjoyed a breakfast of petit pain aux raisins in Del Ray. When she heard the verdict, she did a happy dance around the kitchen, she said, and poured herself a nice big gin and tonic.

But for many Democrats, the conviction is cold comfort. Trump is still expected to be the Republican nominee for president. He has been leading the polls in most swing states. And while it’s far too early to know how anything will play out, some are already worried that his conviction won’t change a thing.

“I’m much more pessimistic that it’s going to make a difference,” said McPhee. “There’s going to be an appeal. It’s going to go on forever. I just feel like the people who follow him will follow him no matter what.”

A conviction becomes a campaign issue

Trump himself, as well as his campaign and his Republican allies, immediately made it clear that they will try to turn his conviction into a feature, not a bug, of his candidacy. On Friday, his campaign declared that it had raised nearly $35 million — an astonishing sum — in the hours after his conviction. And as Trump claimed from Trump Tower that the trial against him had been unfair, his allies suggested that his felon status had left his base more motivated than ever.

“He’s more than just an individual,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican who has allied himself closely with the former president, in a television interview on Friday. “He’s a symbol of fighting back against this government corruption, the deep state, the bureaucracy and all the rest.”

With Trump moving quickly to turn the conviction into campaign fodder, President Biden took the unexpected step of addressing the matter directly on Friday morning — though he took care to limit his remarks to a defense of the process, rather than to include a direct impugning of his opponent over the substance of the case.

“The American principle that no one is above the law was reaffirmed,” Biden said, speaking soberly from the White House and pushing back on Trump’s claims that the trial had been unfair.

“Our justice system, the justice system, should be respected, and we should never allow anyone to tear it down,” Biden said.

A cautious victory lap

The Democrats who have spent years investigating Trump were less restrained than Biden, describing the guilty verdict as a vindication that barely scratched the surface of years of misdeeds.

“The president has committed so many crimes,” said Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, a Democrat who was the chair of the House Judiciary Committee during the first impeachment of Trump in 2019. “It’s very important for the American people to know before an election that they’re dealing with a convicted felon.”

Trump was impeached that December, for allegedly pressuring Ukraine to help him dig up compromising information on Biden, and again in early 2021 for his role in whipping up a mob that had stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, but the Senate acquitted him in both cases.

“For years, people have been frustrated because they have felt that there was no way justice could ever be done in any of the Trump cases, and that now looks to be untrue,” Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a Democrat who was the lead manager of Trump’s second impeachment and served on the House select committee to investigate Jan. 6. “I think it is a vindication of our system of justice, and we can feel good about that.”

Raskin said, however, that it’s too early for opponents of Trump to take a big victory lap.

“We’re still in the fight of our lives politically,” he said. “Ultimately, there is not going to be a resolution to the struggle over democracy and authoritarianism in a courtroom. The people are going to have to make the final statement.”

Nailah Washington, a 38-year-old emergency-room nurse and a Democrat who was reading a book in Del Ray, said she was shocked that Trump hadn’t found a way out of a conviction in New York. And while she doesn’t plan on voting for Trump, she has mostly tuned out the verdict.

The view from the right wing

When the verdict was read on Thursday night, my colleague Ken Bensinger, who covers right-wing media, looked for reactions online. He found few signs of active threats or calls for violence — nothing like the specific and credible chatter that emerged online in the days before Jan. 6, 2021. But he did see a flood of dire, even apocalyptic memes and images. I asked him a few questions about what he is following.

Ken, when the verdict came out, you headed to X, where a lot of key right-wing media figures hang out these days, as well as Telegram and Instagram. What did you find there?

I saw a lot of people talking in vague terms about a civil war. Some people saying the civil war is coming, and this is it. Other people were saying we’ve been in a civil war, and this just proves it. I saw people putting up a line saying, “United States of America: July 4, 1776-May 30, 2024,” the implication being that somehow, this isn’t a real country anymore. I saw people talking about how there’s a need for this kind of new revolution, but all of it was in these lofty, sort of nonspecific terms.

That sounds a little bit like a text message I received from the Trump campaign, which read, in part, “Our country has FALLEN!” Do you think that people online are taking cues from Trump and his campaign, or is it the other way around?

Trump has a kind of ethos that he uses — we’ve been seeing it ever since the ‘American carnage’ inauguration speech he gave in 2017. I think a lot of people have internalized that energy and that vibe and know how to speak Trump without being Trump. And some of them are so good at understanding his aesthetic that sometimes they come up with a thing of their own that he loves, and he’ll amplify it by posting on his own social media.

What kind of memes and images did you come across last night?

There was a still from the recent film “Civil War,” showing the actor Jesse Plemons standing with his rifle, saying, “What kind of American are you?” It was a menacing meme suggesting that there are good Americans and bad Americans — and it’s probably the last kind of message the people who made that film would want to promote. I also saw dozens of people posting upside-down American flags, a symbol of distress that’s gotten more attention after The New York Times reported that Justice Samuel Alito, at one point, had one outside his house. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a Republican, posted one minutes after the verdict was announced. Soon, they were all over the right-wing internet, a symbol like a MAGA hat.

I understand you’ve been speaking with political violence researchers who track this, too. Are they concerned?

Neither of the researchers I spoke with was convinced that we are at a violent moment. The rhetoric they see online is nasty and ugly. But they believe that, at least for now, the prosecution of Jan. 6 rioters has deterred people from putting themselves at risk by engaging in political violence.","A crowd of people holding signs with 'GUILTY' and 'TRUMP IS THE BIGGEST LOSER' visible, with one sign reading 'Ask your doctor if TRUMP is right for you!'.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x117 at 0x7D6BA4963D60>,2024-05-31 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/us/politics/trump-conviction-reaction-election.html,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/18a1d0ea1c.png
d10c2b0bfb,National Review,The Truce Is Over - National Review,"Dear Weekend Jolter,

The “era of good will” in the 2024 presidential race sure was brief.

Yes, unmistakably, Donald Trump’s nomination-acceptance speech showcased a side of the man we’ve never seen before, maybe he’s never seen himself: subdued, soft-spoken, reflective. He spoke Thursday night of God, of feeling “serene” in the moment as bullets flew. His brush with death changed him, that he can tell you. And he made appeals for unity, saying he’s running to be president “for all of America, not half of America.” But Trump, even the low-energy and rambling Trump who took over from his somber half partway in, minced no words indicting his successor’s “failed” and “incompetent” leadership — on the border, inflation, and global chaos — and neither did the GOP convention’s other speakers.

“I will end every single international crisis that the current administration has created,” Trump boasted. Beneath the serenity, a familiar case was being made.

And on the Democratic side, the warnings that Trump poses an existential threat to democracy and is plotting an “extreme” attack on the American way of life have picked right back up again. President Biden on Friday declared without qualification that his rival wants to “rule as a dictator on day one.”

The attempt on the former president’s life last weekend shocked the race — but it hasn’t fundamentally changed the apocalyptic terms in which the election contest is being waged.

Looking back on this historic week, the quasi-truce that was observed between the parties after the shooting can be seen breaking down two days later. As Andy McCarthy noted, Judge Aileen Cannon’s dismissal of the Trump documents case (which, for the record, Andy anticipated) gave Democrats an opening to go on offense. Then Trump opted against a more conciliatory, bridge-building VP pick and announced he had chosen J. D. Vance. Then Biden, right after calling on the country to lower the temperature in politics, doubled down on his allegation that Trump represents a “threat to democracy,” while the DNC warned that the newly named GOP ticket “would undermine our democracy.”

As for the tacit truce that briefly calmed turmoil inside the Democratic Party over whether Biden should pass the torch — it, too, was cracking by Wednesday, when Pelosi ally and Trump antagonist Adam Schiff called on the president to drop out. A string of Biden appearances made clear that he is not getting any better, and arguably has gotten worse since his face-plant debate. Within 24 hours, the coup appeared back on, with even Joe Scarborough joining and Washington now atwitter with speculation that Biden could be convinced to step aside as the campaign fights back. The nominating calendar and old-fashioned hubris could yet defeat the effort to pressure him out — but party elders (and juniors) clearly have not forgotten about the issue that consumed them right up until Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire.

Speaking of hubris: This contest’s sharp turns should chasten operatives and columnists (including this one, whose mention last week of a smooth and uneventful nomination was catastrophically off the mark) trying to predict the course of the next few months. The one thing we can say with confidence, as Mark Wright did earlier this month, is that Trump’s uncanny luck has become an undeniable force, an X factor of immeasurable potency — an in-kind donation from the gods that nobody should tell Alvin Bragg about. Dan McLaughlin charts the remarkable sequence of favorable breaks here, up to and including the Republican nominee’s split-second turn from gunfire and subsequent victory in federal court.

Noah Rothman writes of a “near-cosmic confluence of events” working against the Democrats. Speakers on the GOP convention’s final night milked the idea, too. But even if the Fates are meddling in this election, the sustained vitriol on display and the convulsive effort to oust a sitting president from his party’s ticket indicate the actors in this political drama are determined to control their destiny.

Trump lowered the volume in the 2024 election Thursday night. But don’t be fooled: Neither side has lowered the temperature.

EXCERPTS, THEY’VE GOT ELECTROLYTES

While the Trump assassination attempt briefly quieted the Democratic Party’s infighting over Biden, the president is only becoming more of a liability to the ticket. Jim Geraghty explains:

The debate wasn’t just a “bad night.” There is no sharper, more energetic, clearer-speaking Joe Biden hiding behind the curtain waiting to emerge.

The Joe Biden who addressed the NAACP in Las Vegas on Tuesday is the same guy we saw on the debate stage. Biden pledged to limit rent increases to 55 dollars when he meant to say 5 percent, claimed he “got my start” at historically black Delaware State (Biden graduated from the University of Delaware), and offered jumbled word salad like, “And guess what? Save billions of tons of because of, of pollution, because people, uhwhenuhh, all the studies show, when you get from point A to point B in a train or a vehicle at the same distance you take the train.”

He’s old, tired, mumbles a lot, offers thought and sentence fragments, and apparently can’t read off the teleprompter as well as he used to. He looks lost, even doing a routine meet-and-greet in a supermarket.

In a conference call with House Democrats Saturday, Biden reportedly lost his temper with Representative Jason Crow of Colorado. . . .

There’s no shortage of reasons for Democrats to panic. Biden’s taking advice only from his family and closest advisers. He’s losing his ability to communicate, and still looks old and doddering.

In case you were blindsided by the judge’s ruling this week dismissing Trump’s classified-documents case, Dan McLaughlin breaks it down in tidy fashion. The judge ruled that Jack Smith was not properly appointed as special counsel and so could not continue. Here’s why:

First, the power to initiate and prosecute criminal cases in the name of the United States is an executive power that can only be exercised by an “officer of the United States.” In a typical case, that power is exercised by the U.S. Attorney for a particular district, or by a senior official of the Justice Department — and carried out by subordinates under their supervision. The whole theory of an “independent” special counsel is that he is appointed as a substitute for such an officer, and operates without direct oversight by anyone in DOJ, although he is ultimately accountable to the attorney general. The special counsel regulation purports to vest him “with the full power and authority to exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions of any United States Attorney.” Thus, standing in the place of a U.S. Attorney and exercising at least the same powers, he must be an officer of the United States.

Second, there are two ways to become an officer, and many positions meet both of them: You can be appointed by the president with Senate confirmation, or your position can be created by statute (thus, “established by Law”).

Third, many special counsels, such as David Weiss (the special counsel for Hunter Biden), are already officers of the United States because they are currently serving as U.S. Attorneys. Because of this, there have not been a lot of serious challenges to their appointments. But Smith was a private citizen when appointed.

Fourth, Smith isn’t appointed by Biden. He isn’t Senate-confirmed. So, he can be an officer only if some law created his position.

Fifth, it didn’t. Smith’s role is created only by regulations issued by the attorney general (they were promulgated by Janet Reno after the Independent Counsel law expired in 1999). Unlike the old Independent Counsel statute, there is no special-counsel law.

No statute passed by Congress authorizes or creates the special-counsel role. And the current Supreme Court would not likely find that the attorney general can just create constitutional offices by regulation without a statute. Indeed, Judge Cannon, in a footnote, cites a 1998 article by Brett Kavanaugh arguing that a new statute would be needed to create the special-counsel position. And as she notes, Congress in the past has not only created such positions but also defined their powers — which it did not do here because it never created such a specific position. There are a number of statutes that authorize varying kinds of hiring by the attorney general of people to assist the Justice Department in criminal cases. Cannon found none of them persuasive.

Much has been said and will be investigated about the Secret Service failure inherent in last weekend’s assassination attempt. Dominic Pino provides a retrospective of agency scandals over the years:

In 2012, the federal government released a 229-page list of allegations against Secret Service agents going back to 2004. They included “involvement with prostitutes, leaking sensitive information, publishing pornography, sexual assault, illegal wiretaps, improper use of weapons and drunken behaviour,” the Guardian reported at the time. The list was heavily redacted, and it was not clear how many of the allegations were true.

That list came as the result of a Freedom of Information Act request after the Secret Service prostitution scandal that we know was true, in which agents brought prostitutes to their hotel rooms during then-president Barack Obama’s trip to Colombia. They were also out late partying and drinking hours before needing to report to work protecting the president.

The Colombia scandal was a major news story at the time and attracted significant attention from Congress. It also attracted more attention from the press, which has reported on numerous other Secret Service failures and misconduct over the years, such as:

In 2009, a couple that was not on the approved guest list gained entry to Obama’s first state dinner, where he was hosting the prime minister of India. Secret Service later confirmed that the couple’s credentials were never checked. The couple shook hands with Obama.

In 2011, Secret Service agents were reassigned from patrolling the White House to protecting the home of a personal friend of the agency’s director.

In 2011, a man fired at the White House with a rifle. The Secret Service mistook it for a backfiring car. They only discovered that the gunfire hit the building four days later, when one of the White House housekeepers told them about it.

In 2012, a van the Secret Service had rented that contained metal detectors was stolen from a hotel parking lot the day before then-vice president Joe Biden was supposed to speak in Detroit on Labor Day.

In 2012, a Secret Service agent left a firearm in the bathroom of Mitt Romney’s campaign plane. It was discovered by a journalist.

In 2012, a Secret Service officer was found passed out on a sidewalk in Miami. He was not on duty at the time and was working in a support role for Obama’s visit to the city, which had concluded twelve hours earlier.

In 2013, a supervisor in charge of two dozen agents in the president’s security detail was removed from his position after having tried to retrieve a bullet he left in a woman’s hotel room near the White House. The investigation into the supervisor found that he also separately had sent sexually inappropriate emails to a female subordinate.

In 2014, three agents who were part of the team tasked with fighting off attackers of the president were placed on leave after heavy drinking during Obama’s trip to Amsterdam. One of the agents was found in a hallway, passed out drunk.

Haley Strack reports from Pennsylvania:

Flags fly at half-staff in Buffalo Township, Pennsylvania, where Corey Comperatore served as a volunteer fire chief, before he was killed by President Donald Trump’s would-be assassin at a rally on Saturday. Comperatore’s boots and uniform are now set up on display at the Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Company, memorializing the father-of-two.

Comperatore was with his wife and daughters at Saturday’s rally. He protected his family when shots rang out and was fatally struck by a bullet. The 50-year-old was Saturday’s only casualty, although Pennsylvanians David Dutch, 57, and James Copenhaver, 74, were shot and wounded at the rally. Dutch, a Marine veteran, was shot in the liver and the chest.

Neighbors describe Comperatore as a good friend, and a humble, giving person. Americans, and supporters from around the world, have since rallied to aid the Comperatore family and other victims’ families. Jason Bubb, a friend and personal trainer of Allyson Comperatore’s, Corey’s daughter, started a GoFundMe for the family that raised more than $1 million in one day. A Trump campaign-organized GoFundMe to help the victims of Saturday’s attack has raised more than $4.7 million “for donations to the supporters and families wounded or killed.”

Allyson said on social media that her father was a “a real-life superhero,” who “shielded my body from the bullet that came at us. He loved his family. He truly loved us enough to take a real bullet for us.”

Suspected Donald Trump rally shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks posted a cryptic message to to the online gaming website Steam that read “July 13 will be my premiere, watch as it unfolds” before he opened fired at the former president and his supporters on that date at a campaign stop in Butler, Pennsylvania, multiple outlets reported.

What Do Former Classmates Say About Crooks?

Crooks’ classmates have shared disparate accounts of his time in high school. Jason Kohler, who went to the same high school, told the Associated Press that Crooks was “bullied almost every day” and was “just a outcast.” Julianna Grooms told the Times Crooks was teased for his poor hygiene and body odor, and that peers would say, “Hey, look at the school shooter over there!” But another student, Mark Sigafoos—who shared classes with Crooks—told the Philadelphia Inquirer that he was “very kind” and “nerdy” but wasn’t “as harshly bullied as some people are saying.” Crooks' high school guidance counselor Jim Knapp said the same—""He wasn’t being bullied,” he told the Times. Max Smith, who took a history class with Crooks, told the Enquirer “he definitely was [politically]

conservative...It makes me wonder why he would carry out an assassination attempt on the conservative candidate.” Student Anna Dusch, however, who took a government class with Crooks, told the Times he never revealed any of his political views to his peers despite the subject material. One classmate, Jameson Murphy, told the New York Post that Crooks, 20, wasn't able to make the Bethel Park High School rifle team after missing targets ""by close to 20 feet"" and described him as a ""terrible shot."" Another classmate, who was not named, added that the rifle team coach had concerns about Crooks, saying the former Naval man ""knew when someone’s not the greatest person"" and had noted Crooks' ""crass jokes that weren’t appropriate when there are firearms in the school setting.""

What Have Bethel Park Neighbors Said?

The day after the shooting, FBI investigators locked down Crooks' neighborhood and said they found explosive materials inside his home. Most neighbors have said they were shocked to hear the ""normal person"" who lived on their block has been accused of such a crime, and nearby residents have described him as soft spoken and someone who ""stayed to himself."" One neighbor said signs of support of former president Trump have periodically appeared outside his home over the last several years.

How Did Crooks Allegedly Pull Off The Trump Rally Shooting?

Details continue to emerge about Crooks and the circumstances of the rally shooting since Saturday, including that the building Crooks perched upon to shoot eight bullets at the former president was being used as a police tactical team staging area and was not swept by the Secret Service ahead of the event. How he was able to climb a ladder onto the roof without the notice of law enforcement officials who were stationed inside the building is still unclear and has become a sticking point as criticism of the Secret Service continues to mount. Crooks was found by a law enforcement officer on the roof of the building moments before shooting at Trump and pointed his rifle at the officer, the Associated Press reported, citing an anonymous source, who retreated from the roof moments before Crooks fired on Trump and was then shot by the Secret Service. The FBI has said its investigation so far suggests the shooter acted alone, however, “the FBI continues to conduct logical investigative activity to determine if there were any co-conspirators associated with this attack.” The agency has confirmed earlier reports that it found “suspicious devices” both in the suspect’s home and car, which “have been rendered safe by bomb technicians and are being evaluated at the FBI Laboratory.” Crooks was not on the FBI’s radar before this incident.

What Are Crooks’ Political Affiliations?

FBI special agent in charge Kevin Rojek told reporters on Sunday “we have not identified an ideology associated with the subject” and the agency reiterated that it has found no evidence of strongly held political beliefs so far in their investigation of text messages and social media posts, The New York Times reported Tuesday. In 2021, Crooks donated $15 to the Progressive Turnout Project, a Democratic voter contact campaign in 2021, but did not seem to be otherwise politically involved. He was a registered Republican, the New York Times reported, but was not old enough to have previously voted in a presidential election.

What Else Do We Know About Thomas Matthew Crooks?

Crooks was a 2022 graduate of Bethel Park High School. At graduation, he was one of 20 students in his class to win the National Math & Science Initiative Star Awards. In May, he graduated from the Community College of Allegheny County with an associate’s degree in engineering science. He was employed by the Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center as a dietary aide, according to administrator Marcie Grimm, who said Crooks “performed his job without concern and his background check was clean.” Crooks reportedly told his boss that he needed to take Saturday—the day of the shooting—off of work because he had ""something to do,"" but told his coworkers he would be back on Sunday, according to CNN.

What Do We Know About Thomas Matthew Crooks’ Parents?

Matthew Crooks, the alleged shooter’s father, was profiled by the Trump campaign as one of millions of potential swing state voters who could help the Republicans win the election in 2016, data obtained by Britain’s Channel 4 News shows, and was specifically targeted as someone who may respond well to pro-gun messaging. Crooks was identified in an internal Trump campaign database as a strong Republican, likely a gun owner and a “hunter.” Both of Crooks' parents, Matthew and Mary of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, scored in the top 20 of almost 20,000 people in the town on a series of pro-gun metrics, including the likelihood of hunting for sport and shopping at a hunting retailer. Matthew Crooks is believed to be the legal owner of the AR-15-style rifle his son used to shoot at the president.

Surprising Fact

Mega investment firm BlackRock has pulled an advertisement that was filmed at Bethel Park High School in 2022 and inadvertently featured a scene with Crooks, who was a student there at the time, CBS News reported. The ad was aimed at teachers looking to manage their retirement assets and was filmed in a real classroom with actual Bethel Parks students, Crooks among them. Blackrock said in a statement to CBS that it will make all video footage available to law enforcement authorities.

Key Background

Trump was hosting a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday evening, about an hour from Crooks’ hometown of Bethel Park, when several gunshots were fired. Trump ducked behind a podium and was surrounded by Secret Service agents, who ushered him off the stage with blood visible on the right side of his face. Trump later said he was ""shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.” The former president pumped his fist into the air several times as he was escorted away to loud cheers from his audience. The bullets were fired from several hundred feet away, local District Attorney Richard Goldinger told CNN. President Joe Biden said in a statement he is ""grateful"" to hear Trump was safe and condemned acts of political violence. Local news outlets have reported that the rally attendee killed Saturday was 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, former fire chief of the Buffalo Township, Pennsylvania, volunteer fire department. Two other people also suffered serious injuries. Trump said in a post to Truth Social on Saturday: “We pray for the recovery of those who were wounded, and hold in our hearts the memory of the citizen who was so horribly killed.”

d477c53691,USA TODAY,Presidential polls are useless. Will Trump win? Will Biden? Nobody has a crystal ball. - USA TODAY,"I have bad news: Americans are political polling themselves to death.

There are way too many people standing open-mouthed in front of the firehose of “BREAKING PRESIDENTIAL POLLING NEWS.” They’re gagging or growing bloated and, quite frankly, I think it’s affecting their brains.

Right this moment, just past the mid-point of May, there are only three things any of us can say with certainty about the November presidential election:

Donald Trump might win.

Joe Biden might win.

RFK Jr. is definitely not going to win.

New presidential polls are here, everybody freak out!

That’s quite literally it. Anyone claiming anything else is peddling nonsense, and anyone using polling data to assert anything with even a modicum of certainty is a fool.

And yet … fools abound.

Thus the colossal liberal freakout – and accompanying MAGA “Yipeee!” – over a recent set of swing-state surveys by The New York Times, Siena College and The Philadelphia Inquirer. The polls, according to the Times, “found that Mr. Trump was ahead among registered voters in a head-to-head matchup against Mr. Biden in five of six key states: Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and Pennsylvania. Mr. Biden led among registered voters in only one battleground state, Wisconsin.”

Trump the liar:Trump's followers believe his every lie. But if he was a real alpha-male, he'd lie BIGGER.

If you’re a Biden backer or a Trump disliker, that would understandably go in the “not great” category.

But, and I’m going to write this real loud for the assorted Nostradami in the back who are busily penning their 23rd “Get ready for Trump to win” Substack posts: THIS IS ONE SET OF POLLS NEARLY SIX MONTHS BEFORE THE ELECTION, POLLS ARE ONLY A SNAPSHOT OF A SPECIFIC MOMENT AND ABOUT A MILLION THINGS CAN CHANGE BETWEEN AND NOW AND THE FIRST VOTE!

Polls are useless to regular voters and are best ignored

The only people in America who should be worrying about or paying attention to polling right now are the people who work for the Biden and Trump campaigns. Polls can provide some useful data for them in terms of strengths, weaknesses and voters they need to target.

For everyone else, it’s empty calories feeding our Sisyphean desire to predict the future. We can’t wait until the election results are in and the contentious race is called. We must know who’s going to win now. NOW, I TELL YOU!

So a willing news media, relishing the chaos Trump brings and the possibility Biden might say something old-sounding, cranks out or reports on poll after poll after poll after poll. It’s not so much horserace political coverage as it is the gleeful creation of a damn stampede.

So much can change between now and the election

And it is all – with apologies to every news organization, including my own – useless.

Setting aside the possibility of polling inaccuracies in an age in which younger people are harder to reach and people in general don’t want to talk to anybody – polling is a science, but not a perfect one – here are a few of the things that could easily alter the course of the presidential race between now and November:

Biden and Trump, as you may have heard, are up in years. One awkward fall or one health emergency – neither outside the realm of possibility – could reshape the race.

Trump could suddenly be a convicted felon or additional damaging evidence from one of his other numerous criminal cases could come out. His ongoing trial in New York City, involving election interference stemming from a hush money payment to an adult film star, has not been going well for him. A conviction is by no means certain, but it wouldn’t be surprising. Regardless of what he and his loyalists say, a felony conviction would absolutely damage his campaign.

For Biden, any jump in food or gas prices could spell doom. Many voters pay little attention to the nuances of the candidates and make up their minds based on how they feel in the weeks and days before voting. Vibes, dumb as they are, could submarine the president’s chances.

Everything's fluid, from abortion rights to debates to the war in Gaza

Abortion rights in the wake of Roe v. Wade getting overturned remain a key issue. With abortion-related ballot measures popping up in a number of states, there’s no telling how they could impact turnout or the presidential vote. A U.S. Supreme Court ruling on access to the abortion medication mifepristone, expected next month, could further roil the waters.

The Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, which has angered a portion of Biden’s Democratic base, could end, or it could worsen.

There are plans for two presidential debates. One or both could provide voters a stark reminder of Trump’s chaotic nature and authoritarian rhetoric. Or Biden, known for verbal stumbles, could harm his chances and bring back concerns about his age.

Trump could pick a complete nutter to be his running mate.

Heck, the presently risingcicada broods could zombify and devour us all, making every vote a protest vote against Biden’s Brood Blight.

Stop wasting time worrying about polls – focus on what matters

The point is, it’s freakin’ May, for Pete’s sake, and nobody out there – not you brilliant TV pontificator and not you erudite data dude – knows what’s going to transpire in the months ahead.

I’m a liberal fellow and I despise Trump. But do I think Biden is going to cruise to victory? Absolutely not.

I wouldn’t be the least bit surprised if Trump won, as a sizable swath of the populace seems to have grown un-fond of reality.

Trump VP candidate?Who will be dumb enough to become Donald Trump's vice president?

About the only thing I feel certain about is that every minute a person who cares about their candidate spends stressing about or heralding polling data is a minute wasted.

Given the stakes of this election – whether you’re a liberal, a conservative or an anti-Trumper or whatever – we should not be wasting minutes.

Ignore the polls. They’re stupid. There are no crystal balls, and we can’t predict the future.

But we can take action that gives us a fighting chance to see the future we want. And there’s nothing foolish about that.","Two individuals are shown, one with a blurred face and the other with a visible face showing a serious expression.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6B7DD2C3A0>,2024-05-19 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.usatoday.com,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/05/19/trump-biden-polling-swing-states-ignore-them/73705965007/,['Politics' 'Opinion/Editorial'],[0.95 0.9 ],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/d477c53691.png
4630d6c7de,ProPublica,How America’s “Most Powerful Lobby” Is Stifling Efforts to Reform Oil Well Cleanup in State After State - ProPublica,"Last year, representatives of New Mexico’s oil industry met behind closed doors with the very groups with which they typically clash — state regulators and environmentalists — in search of an answer to the more than 70,000 wells sitting unplugged across the state. Many leak oil, brine and toxic or explosive gasses, and more than 1,700 have already been left to the public to clean up.

The situation is so dire that oil companies agreed to help try to find a solution.

After months of negotiations, the state regulators who ran the meetings emerged with a proposal that they hoped would appease everyone in the room. The bill would instruct drillers to set aside more money to plug their wells, authorize regulators to block risky sales to companies that would be unlikely to afford to clean up their wells and implement a buffer zone between wells and hospitals, schools, homes and other buildings.

The industry, unhappy with the state’s final language, turned against the bill it helped shape.

The influential New Mexico Oil and Gas Association told its supporters that HB 133 was “a radical and dangerous approach designed to strangle the oil and gas industry” and asked them to send their elected representatives a form letter opposing it. If passed, the trade group proclaimed, the bill would “Destroy New Mexico.” The Independent Petroleum Association of New Mexico, which represents small oil companies, called the bill “overzealous.”

In the face of such opposition, Democrats removed key provisions. The New Mexico Oil and Gas Association eventually changed its position to neutral, but largely stripped of substance, the bill died on the floor of the House of Representatives.

“Industry killing the bills was the dynamic I saw,” said Adam Peltz, a senior attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund who helped write the New Mexico proposal, as well as similar bills in other oil-producing states.

New Mexico faces a multibillion-dollar shortfall between the money companies have set aside to plug wells and the actual cost of doing so, according to state research, a reality mirrored in many states.

Across the country, more than 2 million oil and gas wells sit unplugged, but the money held in cleanup funds, called bonds, is many tens of billions of dollars short of the projected costs, ProPublica and Capital & Main found. Now, a once-in-a-lifetime effort to shrink that shortfall is underway, spurred in large part by federal funding for well-plugging efforts.

As regulators and legislators seek to require that drillers set aside more money for the work, they have invited oil companies and trade groups to help write the regulations. This dynamic — politically expedient in states where the industry wields tremendous influence — has combined with secretive drafting processes and millions of dollars of industry lobbying to weaken or kill proposals in state after state.

In some, including Oklahoma and Utah, lawmakers propose bills only after oil trade groups approve the language. In many others, regulators and drillers work together through organizations such as the quasi-governmental Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission to design policy. But even when given a seat at the table, like in New Mexico, the industry has turned against reform efforts.

Holly Hopkins, a vice president of the American Petroleum Institute, the industry’s largest trade group, said in a statement, “We are continuing to work with policymakers to advance balanced regulations that enhance safety, sustainability and environmental stewardship and help ensure that American energy is produced responsibly from start to finish.”

Those working to reform a status quo that has left potentially millions of wells as orphans disagree. Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, is preparing to file a bill in Congress targeting oil companies’ use of bankruptcy to offload cleanup obligations on the public.

“The challenge in anything that involves fossil fuels, and particularly that addresses a profit strategy of fossil fuel companies, is you’re taking on the most powerful lobby in the United States of America,” he said.

“All Hell Broke Loose”

After a previous effort to update oil regulations failed in the New Mexico Legislature last year, the state convened a working group. Regulators, the industry and environmentalists spent months negotiating the details. Written with input from this broad coalition, and with the governor’s office and the Legislature in the hands of Democrats, it appeared the political stars had aligned.

But roadblocks quickly appeared. Lawmakers hadn’t been included in the negotiations, even though a sponsor would have to carry the bill through the session, which lasts only a few weeks. The talks were also closed to the public, and some environmental groups had been excluded because of ongoing litigation against the state.

As soon as Rep. Kristina Ortez, a Democrat, filed HB 133, “all hell broke loose,” she said, with infighting from the closed-door negotiations spilling into the Legislature.

“The oil and gas companies didn’t appreciate the language,” Ortez said. “They felt like they weren’t being listened to.”

Some environmentalists, meanwhile, felt that industry representatives had already watered down the bill too much during the negotiations and came out against it, she said.

HB 133 was picked apart further as it worked its way through the legislative process.

With the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association now opposed, House committees submitted substitute measures to shift the industry’s position, gain votes and pass the bill. The amended versions eliminated a requirement that wells be a certain distance from schools and other buildings. Also gone was language to remove a cap on the monetary penalties regulators could assess against oil companies. And bonding requirements were watered down to the point that new, stricter rules would only apply to a handful of drillers.

By the time the rewritten legislation made it to the House floor, “I was so wildly unenthusiastic of the bill,” said Andrew Forkes-Gudmundson, who worked on it for environmental group Earthworks.

Missi Currier, the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association’s president and CEO, said that the group dropped its opposition after the bill was amended. But as the bill’s supporters whipped votes, they still encountered resistance from legislators who had been persuaded by small oil companies’ arguments that the new rules would push drillers out of business, Forkes-Gudmundson recalled.

Having hemorrhaged environmentalists’ support without gaining significant votes from moderates and conservatives, Democratic leadership never brought the bill up for a vote by the full House.

State-Sponsored Influence

Because the oil and gas industry is largely governed at the state level, states banded together in the 1930s with the approval of Congress, and more recently with federal funding, to share best practices for regulating oil. The resulting organization, the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, has evolved into a forum where, much as happened in New Mexico, the industry influences the ideas that regulators take back to their states and write into the rules governing oil companies.

This was on full display in October at the commission’s annual conference, hosted among Utah’s Wasatch Mountains, which were blanketed by autumnal reds and yellows. With Chevron, ExxonMobil and Oxy Petroleum among the conference’s largest sponsors, oil and gas regulators from across the country had gathered at the Chateaux Deer Valley, an upscale ski resort overlooking Park City’s renowned pistes.

As the conference began, regulators were clear-eyed that taxpayers could be saddled with the cost of plugging orphan wells.

“This year, I spent $29 million, and somehow that’s still not enough,” Jason Harmon, one of West Virginia’s head oil regulators, said about his state’s well-plugging efforts.

Catherine Dickert, New York’s top oil regulator, noted that wells in her state get passed to ever-smaller companies “until finally they get transferred to somebody who owns two wells that never, ever will be able to plug them.”

And cleanup funds are “woefully inadequate in Pennsylvania right now,” Kurt Klapkowski, the commonwealth’s lead oil regulator, told the attendees. “And we’ve gotten a lot of opposition about increasing that.”

But as the conference progressed, talk of bonding regulations gave way to discussions of repurposing old wells. Perhaps natural gas would still be needed to develop hydrogen fuel, an ExxonMobil representative discussed on a panel at the conference. Or wells could be used for storing captured carbon dioxide, an Oxy Petroleum representative said on another. State regulators returned home with these and other pitches from the oil industry on how to manage aging oil fields.

In addition to conferences, the organization pens pro-oil and gas resolutions that it has placed in state legislatures. In these resolutions, its members have called on the federal government to minimize regulations on climate-warming gasses, increase oil-related tax credits and shield certain royalty owners from cleanup costs. States including Wyoming, Utah and Oklahoma, among others, have passed resolutions pushed by the commission.

By the 1970s, the Department of Justice was arguing that the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission had largely become a lobbying organization. Critics today say the commission is hampering reform.

“They’re this unique mechanism for corporate capture,” said Jesse Coleman, a senior researcher with public interest watchdog organization Documented who has tracked the commission for years. “They get to act as this impartial source of information, when in reality, they’re on the industry side.”

While about 60% of the people involved with the group were government officials, a quarter worked in the oil and gas industry, according to a 2021 membership survey Documented obtained via a public records request. The Environmental Defense Fund is typically the only green group in the room.

The survey also found that people involved with the group saw its role as promoting “diverse viewpoints on climate related issues” and “fighting back against measures that seek to ‘keep it in the ground’” — the “it” referring to climate-warming fossil fuels.

As the U.S. Department of the Interior doles out $4.7 billion to plug orphan wells from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the commission and its members have helped write guidelines governing the spending, most of which is going to states, documents obtained via public records requests revealed. In many cases, the commission’s suggestions were highly technical and provided assistance to a federal department trying to navigate various states’ unique laws.

But at other times, the commission and its members asked the Interior Department to tear up requirements that states prioritize plugging wells that are emitting methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and pay the regional prevailing wage to workers hired to do the plugging.

In an email responding to questions, Lori Wrotenbery, the commission’s executive director, said the group’s pushback was justified because the Interior Department had exceeded its authority in telling states how to spend the money.

For Coleman, resistance from the commission comes as no surprise.

“The regulations and the resolutions that they promote have allowed a greater degree of pollution,” he said, “and have allowed greater leniency on the oil and gas industry.”

Reform Efforts Failing to Launch

Despite industry pressure, some states have begun addressing the orphan well epidemic. California passed a law in October that could significantly increase oil companies’ bonds. A few weeks later, Louisiana strengthened rules pushing companies to more quickly plug wells that aren’t pumping.

But New Mexico’s story is more typical. There and around the country, reform efforts have foundered.

Oklahoma, for example, faces an estimated shortfall of more than $7 billion between cleanup costs and bonds, according to state data analyzed by ProPublica and Capital & Main. Still, a group of Republican legislators has tried and failed for several years to increase the state’s bonding levels.

This legislative session, Rep. Brad Boles, a Republican, ran a bill to increase the highest level of required bonds from $25,000 to $150,000. Boles told a House committee that he had worked with two oil trade groups on the bill, describing it as “language that helps move the needle but also is not seen as anti-industry.”

His proposal unanimously passed the House of Representatives and a Senate committee. Even so, it died without a vote in the Senate. (Boles declined to “point fingers at any particular person or group” for its failure but said he would try again next session.)

Meanwhile in West Virginia, which has a projected bonding shortfall of more than $15 billion and some of the nation’s weakest bonding laws, a bill to strengthen regulations never made it onto a committee agenda. This is the sixth straight year that such legislation has failed, Mountain State Spotlight reported.

The bill’s lead sponsors did not respond to requests for comment.

“The industry has a pretty solid lock on the Legislature,” said David McMahon, a West Virginia attorney who drafted this year’s bill.

In New Mexico, Ortez, the legislator who ran HB 133, said she was “dismayed” by how the bill fell apart, even though it was “maybe too fair” to oil and gas companies. But she hasn’t given up, pledging to continue pitching the industry on reform and finding language that can secure the necessary votes in advance of next year’s legislative session.

“I feel so strongly about this moving forward,” she said. “We need to make it happen.”","An illustration shows a woman in a business suit shaking hands with a man in a suit, with a third man observing them.

7b9b563e48,The Guardian,"Macron is history, Le Pen is triumphant. What do ‘reasonable’ French voters like me do now? | Pierre Haski - The Guardian","For all of my adult life, the Le Pen family has felt like a shadow hanging over my head. Jean-Marie, the father, used to make jokes about the Holocaust. He was a former French paratrooper in Algeria who was accused of torturing prisoners. Then along came his daughter, Marine, who looked less threatening but more ambitious. Then her niece, Marion, who proved even more reactionary.

The Le Pen influence appeared to be growing, but I always had the naive idea that “reasonable” people, from the right as well as from the left, would never let them win. It proved true in 2002 when Jean-Marie Le Pen made it to the second round of the presidential election: the French then voted massively for Jacques Chirac. It proved true again in 2017 and 2022, when Marine also reached the second round and was defeated by Emmanuel Macron, the promising young outsider who wanted to dismantle the left-right dividing line. It’s no longer true.

I woke up this morning to a different country, one in which the Le Pen clan is at the gates of power. For the first time ever in France, a political party on the far right could win an overall majority of seats in parliament through an election, and place its 28-year-old figurehead, Jordan Bardella, in Hôtel de Matignon, the prime minister’s office in Paris. The results of the first round of the snap legislative elections called by Macron were a clear victory for the National Rally, which is the renamed National Front created by Jean-Marie Le Pen.

The second round, scheduled for 7 July, is turning into a moment of truth for French politics, with huge consequences for the country, for Europe, for Ukraine and so many other issues in this troubled world. The only question for the second round is whether the National Rally emerges with an overall majority, which would force Macron into a humiliating and complex “cohabitation”: a very French phenomenon in which the president and the prime minister come from opposing parties.

The only way to prevent such a majority is for all other political forces to apply a simple rule: withdraw their candidate if it’s a three-way fight in their constituency. This would bring a hung parliament, political instability and possible chaos; but it would be less damaging than having the far right in power. At least that’s what “reasonable” people would think.

But politics is more complicated than that, in a polarised country where the united front of leftwing parties came second, leaving Macron’s centrist bloc a distant third. Some people, it seems, are more afraid of the left than of the far right.

Take Le Figaro, the grand old newspaper of the right, which belongs to the Dassault family of Rafale jets fame: on Monday morning, this broadsheet newspaper transformed the second round into a contest between Bardella and Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of the radical left movement France Unbowed (LFI), who is a major figure in the leftwing alliance, but not the only one.

Mélenchon is a scary figure for rightwing voters, and Le Figaro is clearly telling its readers who not to vote for by pushing the National Rally narrative on its front page. The former prime minister Édouard Philippe, and the finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, have said they want to oppose the National Rally, but have stopped short of calling their supporters to vote for any other candidate because of Mélenchon.

If voters next Sunday share the same apprehension, a boulevard opens up for the first far-right prime minister in recent French history, a leap into the unknown.

What went wrong? One can obviously wonder why Macron decided to gamble the country’s future on a snap election he had no chance of winning, opening the gate to the far right. We’ll leave that to historians, as the president is a spent force.

We can also wonder why this country, with its many assets, has generated enough anger and resentment among its citizens to produce an election result that is more likely to damage its economy and social cohesion than solve real problems. We can also question a French political elite that was so blind it let the far right prosper in large corners of a society that felt forgotten and despised.

All of this is true, and is being discussed everywhere now in France, among friends, colleagues and in our family circles. Everyone is looking in the mirror and wondering what to do next Sunday in the second round. At the very least, we’ll have to learn to live in a divided land where the National Rally controls small towns and vast areas of rural France, while the “reasonable” people have the upper hand in major cities including Paris. This is a real tragedy.","A group of people, including a woman in a black blazer, are gathered around a smartphone, with one person holding a microphone.

0e3d2e1423,Fox News,Blue city hires equity trainer who calls US military 'home of White supremacy' as part of 'culture change' - Fox News,"FIRST ON FOX – A city in New Mexico is currently processing a ""culture change"" in government where critical race theory permeates, with the help of a far-left equity consultant.

Shortly after he was elected in 2017, Albuquerque Democratic Mayor Tim Keller promised to overhaul the government with antiracist ideals.

""From Day One of our administration, we knew that inequity was growing and that we would have to change the culture,"" he said. ""When has learning and growing ever been comfortable?""

Keller established the Office of Equity and Inclusion (OEI) in March 2018 to implement his vision of racial equity. The office created trainings on critical race theory and made some employees feel uncomfortable along the way, the OEI director said in the 2021 report.

One of the equity consultants hired included Zamil Salhab from RACED Consulting, who has far-left views, including that the U.S. military is the ""home of White supremacy."" Salhab is a ""genderqueer first generation American and Post 9-11 veteran,"" according to the RACED Consulting website.

SPACE FORCE COMMANDER WHO SAYS HE LOST PENSION FOR CRITICIZING DEI IN MILITARY OPENS UP ON BEING 'BETRAYED'

""Being first generation and being black, being queer. And then to go into what I believe is the home of White supremacy and patriarchy, the military. Little did I realize like what damage… I was doing to myself and what I'd have to go through in order to deconstruct myself after getting out of the service,"" Salhab said in June 2020. ""Because society not only teaches that Black bodies are less than… And so and then to be a woman. So to deal with those different intersectionalities of the White supremacy construct, it was, you know, for a period of time I thought I was nuts, I thought I was crazy.""

The city confirmed, ""The Office of Equity and Inclusion contracted with RACED Consulting LLC.""

RACED Consulting has expertise on the topic of ""white fragility,"" according to its website.

""We will explore white fragility and its impact on building racially inclusive practices… We share personal experiences with white fragility and its effect on you and those around you,"" the website states.

Another area of expertise is ""De-Centering Whiteness,"" ""Interrupting White Supremacy,"" and ""Interrupting Whiteness.""

Despite all the CRT training that low-level employees attended, RACED Consulting wrote in the city's 2021 report that higher ups were largely absent from those trainings.

""The said process of deconstructing white supremacy behaviors is both external and internal. Visibly absent from the 2021 RACED sessions were department directors and city leadership,"" the consulting section in the report stated.

""Investment into the Culture Change Initiative must manifest through all levels of Albuquerque city government and be more expansive than just monetary; it must consider the intangible costs and benefits of building true relationships throughout the city and the wider community to foster a deep and sustainable Culture Change,"" it concluded in the city's official report.

And, according to the diversity, equity and inclusion head, some city employees are uncomfortable with Keller's racial agenda.

""We also see a small but vocal resistance to addressing racism,"" Michelle Melendez, director of the Office of Equity and Inclusion, said about the internal dynamics. ""Systemic racism is one of the root causes of some of our most serious challenges, and addressing it within municipal government will make our city better for the long-term. That’s culture change.""

""There is a better understanding and openness to conversations about anti-racism and social justice topics,"" another section of the report said.

As part of their effort to change the culture, every department was given a DEI staffer who would report on and give an ""equity assessment."" Those ""liaisons"" went through over 10 months of training in order to be prepared for their missions.

""We all realized in our first year of working with equity liaisons that shifting the culture of institutions is extremely challenging,"" the report said. ""Each of the liaisons who were able to complete the 10 months of training and technical assistance was able to introduce and move forward equity work in their respective departments.""

Some of the departments that were included in the equity liaison were animal welfare, environmental health, transit and the police department.

Each of those departments developed their own ""racial equity action plan[s] of that Department’s practices, policies, expenditures, and distribution of resources.""

Before Keller was elected in 2017, employees ""were reluctant to talk openly about race, racism,"" according to OEI Director Melendez.

f9718c29eb,The Guardian,Roma children at centre of Leeds unrest returned to extended family - The Guardian,"Roma children who were taken into care, sparking unrest in Leeds last week, have been returned to their extended family.

Police and social services removed the four children from a house in Harehills on Thursday to prevent them being taken abroad in breach of a court order. The children, aged between eight and 14, had been living with family members since being removed from their parents in April, the family court in Leeds heard on Tuesday.

Leeds city council said social workers had been tipped off that there was a plan to take them to either Romania or Cyprus, contrary to a court order stating they could not leave the UK without permission from the local authority.

After an assessment by social services on Monday, Judge Helen Trotter-Jackson ruled that the children, who cannot be named for legal reasons, could be looked after by extended family 20 minutes’ walk away from their parents.

Relatives at Leeds family court were asked to avoid sharing details of the case on social media and to not take part in public celebrations, amid concerns from the council about the profile of the case.

After the ruling, the children’s mother said through her advocate: “I’m glad the children are back with the family.”

The court heard the children had been “extremely upset” in their emergency foster placement since Thursday and had not settled. They had been kept together but with carers who were not “culturally matched”.

Trotter-Jackson urged the parties involved to put the interests of the children above everything else. “It’s important that everyone focuses on the children’s welfare and taking the temperature down in this case,” she said.

She had been told of the father’s threats to go on hunger strike and allegations that members of the Roma community said they would cause further unrest if the children were not returned.

“This court will simply not take threats like that into account because our paramount concern is for the welfare of those children and it seems to me if those statements were made, they were not helpful. I would ask everyone to be mindful of their behaviour and put the children first,” she said.

She called for calm, adding: “We cannot have the children being upset in the way they were on Thursday.”

Social media posts, including from the far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, suggesting thousands of Roma people would be gathering in Harehills to cause further unrest, led to delays to court proceedings.

Police said 20 people had been arrested after the events on Thursday night in which a police car was flipped on its side and a double-decker bus set on fire. They said 17 of the arrests were directly related to the night’s disorder and three were “because of other issues within the area”.

The court heard how the family, whose situation triggered the upheaval, had had no dealings with social services until April, when a seven-month-old baby at the house received an unexplained skull fracture.

The parents and grandparents, who lived at the same address, were arrested and later bailed, trigging care proceedings for all the children in the house. Later, a child in the family came forward claiming she had dropped the baby by accident and had not told any adults, court documents revealed.

There will be a further hearing in August to decide a more permanent solution for the children’s care.","A photograph of two mounted police officers on horses in a residential area with people and a baby stroller in the background, with the logo of The Guardian in the corner.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BC774CD60>,2024-07-23 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jul/23/roma-children-at-centre-of-leeds-unrest-returned-to-extended-family,['Local/Regional' 'Politics'],[0.95 0.75],Unlikely,Likely,sample_review/images/f9718c29eb.png
9c3b2c03bb,Forbes,November’s Presidential Election Likely Won’t Stop The Fed From Cutting Rates - Forbes,"Last month, prices fell to their lowest levels almost two years. The June Consumer Price Index dropped to 3.0% annually–down from 3.4% the prior month—and is now on the verge of hitting the Federal Reserve’s inflation target of 2%.

Almost immediately after the release of the CPI data, Republicans warned the Federal Reserve not to cut rates prior to the election in November. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell testified before the Senate Banking Committee, Senator Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) told Politico, “I personally don’t think they should. Anything they do before November would be rightfully—would raise the question of their own independence.”

But will the Fed heed the call from Republicans to keep rates at their current level (even if CPI drops further) when its Federal Open Markets Committee meets on July 31 and September 18? Based on past history, the answer is a resounding no.

Over the past 50 years, the Federal Reserve has raised or lowered the target for the federal funds rate seven times in the final three months leading up to a U.S. presidential election:

On Oct. 19, 1976, the central bank cut rates by 0.5% (to coincide with the official end to the gold standard), just weeks before voters went to the polls to choose between President Gerald Ford and Governor Jimmy Carter.

In the three months leading up to the 1980 election between President Carter and Governor Ronald Reagan, the Fed raised rates on three occasions (by 1% each time), in an effort to combat historically high rates of inflation.

On Oct. 2, 1984, the Fed slashed rates by 0.5%, roughly one month prior to Reagan’s historic victory over former Vice President Walter Mondale.

On Aug. 16, 1988, the Fed hiked rates by almost 2 percentage points. Despite this, Vice President George H.W. Bush overcame a significant polling deficit to beat Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis handily.

On Oct. 8, 2008, the central bank cut rates by 0.5% in response to the deepening financial and housing crisis. In November, Barack Obama was elected president in a resounding win over Republican John McCain.

In each circumstance noted above, the Fed acted in response to the economic situation, and it did so dramatically (moving rates up or down by at least 0.5%). Therefore, it is fairly safe to assume that if the Fed governors believe they have successfully reached their inflation target, and think a reduction of the federal funds rate is necessary, they would do exactly that—regardless of politics.

In fact, if the central bank wants to avoid the appearance of political favoritism, policymakers must cut rates if economic conditions call for it, just as they resisted pressure from Democrats earlier this year to raise their inflation target (which would have enabled the Fed to reduce the federal funds rate and potentially boost the economy).

The good news for Republicans is that even if the Fed does lower interest rates, the likelihood it will benefit the incumbent president, Democrat Joe Biden, is marginal at best.

For example, the party controlling the White House did not hold onto the presidency after the Fed slashed rates prior to the 1976 and 2008 elections. Meanwhile, George H.W. Bush retained the presidency for Republicans in 1988, despite the Federal Reserve raising the federal funds rate by a whopping 2%.

Finally, any rate cuts this late in the election cycle will not likely achieve full impact until after Election Day on November 5, meaning that neither Republicans nor Democrats need worry or get too excited about what the Fed does in the coming months. But for whoever wins the White House—well, that is another story.",A close-up of a US 100 dollar bill with a portrait of Benjamin Franklin and a vase in the background.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BA24EAFE0>,2024-07-18 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.forbes.com,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paulweinstein/2024/07/18/novembers-presidential-election-wont-stop-fed-from-cutting-rates/,['Politics' 'Business and Finance'],[0.9 0.8],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/9c3b2c03bb.png
1d87718963,Forbes,Pending Supreme Court Cases And The Challenges For Tax Policy - Forbes,"Libin Zhang and Kristin Hickman discuss the broader implications of Moore v. United States and the challenges to the Chevron doctrine during a live recording from the American Bar Association Section of Taxation May meeting.

This transcript has been edited for length and clarity.

David D. Stewart: Welcome to the podcast. I'm David Stewart, editor in chief of Tax Notes Today International. This week: we'll do it live.

We have something a bit different for this episode. On Friday, May 3, I went down to the ABA May Tax Section Meeting and recorded a live podcast. My guests were Libin Zhang and Kristin Hickman, who I'll introduce more in a bit.

On previous episodes, we covered Moore [v. United States] and the possible end of the Chevron doctrine, but this time we're bringing those two issues together and asking what this could mean for tax policy. I hope you enjoy the interview as much as I did when I recorded it. And now, let's go to that interview.

And now welcome to a live recording of the Tax Notes Talk podcast. With the Supreme Court taking up a case on what seemed like settled questions of law in Moore v. U.S. and greater scrutiny of agency decisions, including the possibility that the 40-year-old Chevron doctrine could be overturned, what is the outlook for tax policy? Are we entering into an era of greater uncertainty where previous assumptions about the taxing power and the IRS are facing questions?

To help us explore that, I'm joined by Libin Zhang. He's a partner with Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP in New York. There, he advises clients on a diverse range of real estate, corporate, and international taxation matters, and he occasionally writes about tax-related issues, including in Tax Notes.

Kristin Hickman is the McKnight Presidential Professor in Law at the University of Minnesota Law School. She's a leading authority in the fields of tax administration, administrative law, and statutory interpretation. Her articles on these topics have appeared in many books and journals, including Tax Notes. Recently, she's spoken extensively on Chevron deference and its implications.

So let's start off with the Moore case. We have this case that's been taken up by the Supreme Court on the question of when can income be taxed? When is it income, really? Which seemed like we all assumed the answer to that before, but the Supreme Court's actually taking this up, so what can we read into them even hearing the case?

Libin Zhang: Yeah. I think that's a very great question. I think part of the issue is that you mentioned these are settled questions of law, but there seems to be a lot of debate over what the actual answer is. Is Eisner v. Macomber still good law? Is there a realization requirement in the 16th Amendment in the tax law? And also, did the Ninth Circuit reach the wrong decision or say too broad language in this decision? So I think it's good that the Supreme Court is having taken interest in these tax cases and, perhaps, reining in some of the broad language that the lower circuits have been writing about.

Kristin Hickman: So I want to take a step back for a minute and recognize, with respect to Moore, that I think you can't really look at as a tax case. You have to look at it as a constitutional law case. Sure, it involves the taxing power, but as tax attorneys, we like to get swept up into the conversation about tax policy, which of course is very important to all of us.

But I think from the perspective of the justices, they are thinking, I suspect anyway, I have no real firsthand insight here, but I do think that they are focusing on this case through a slightly different lens, at least in the context of economic and regulatory matters. There, among some justices at least, is very much of a perception of government versus the little guy, with concern for the little guy.

And at least as this case has been presented to the court with the petitioners, it's a married couple, individuals; you're not looking at a great, big multinational corporation versus the government in this particular case.

I think they're very concerned about methodology, originalism, textualism. The justices are very concerned about expansive governmental power and potential federal government overreach. And so at least as I look at this case, those are some of the dynamics that I see coming into play.

On a certain level, realization is something you learn about in basic federal income tax, which is probably the only tax course any of these justices ever took. It triggers a very visceral reaction, I think. And so you put all of those things together, and I suspect that's how they're looking at this case rather than thinking of it in terms of technical tax policy.

Now, of course, the briefing brought in the technical tax policy, and that may give them pause, but I think we have to appreciate the bigger constitutional picture that's going on here rather than just focusing on it as a tax case.

David D. Stewart: Well, bringing it back to tax, I suppose.

Kristin Hickman: Sure.

David D. Stewart: But within that constitutional context, so we have the federal government's taxing power is basically used for every area of tax policy. Is this an era where we're going to see that constitutional authority get reined in by the Supreme Court potentially?

Libin Zhang: Yeah, I think potentially you saw that a little bit with the district court decision on the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA), where one of the arguments the government used was that the CTA was justified by the taxing power and the judge didn't buy that argument.

Now, we'll see if this thing gets overturned on appeal or not. But definitely for a long time under the commerce clause, people thought the commerce clause was unlimited, and then suddenly with Lopez and Morrison in the '90s, that got reined in a little bit. And that's something we could definitely see in the taxing world as well, especially as we saw from the discussions in Moore, maybe not everything in the world is income that can be taxed under the 16th Amendment.

Kristin Hickman: Yeah. I mean, certainly in Moore, depending on what the Court does with it, you could see some reining in. I'm not so sure with respect to the commerce clause argument in the Corporate Transparency Act case. I will point to the Supreme Court's decision in NFIB v. Sebelius, where they upheld the Affordable Care Act and the shared responsibility payment under that act on taxing power grounds. So I don't think the trend is necessarily all in one direction, but certainly so much hangs on what happens in Moore irrespective of what happens with the commerce power.

Libin Zhang: I think also as the government, or maybe just academics, are thinking about new kinds of taxes — wealth taxes and mark-to-market taxation — that's going to be pushing the envelope on the limits of the government's taxing power. And you saw some of this in the questioning in Moore, where some of the justices were asking about wealth taxes, so they definitely have that in mind as to whether there is some outer limit on the kinds of taxes the government can impose.

David D. Stewart: Is that likely the reason why they took up Moore, was to set out a marker on those other taxes?

Libin Zhang: Yeah. I think that's one of the theories that people have subscribed to, especially that the Ninth Circuit opinion could be interpreted as giving free rein to these other kinds of taxes as well.

Kristin Hickman: Yeah. I think some of it is the fact that it came out of the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit is the most overturned circuit, I believe, in the country. But again, I think some of the reason they took the Moore case is more in terms of this concern about governmental power in general and government versus the little guy.

David D. Stewart: OK. Well, let's turn to another area of interest that the Supreme Court has taken on, and that is these two cases where they might potentially strike down this long-standing precedent of Chevron deference. Does that raise questions about the ability of Treasury and the IRS to issue tax regulations going forward?

Kristin Hickman: So my own view on this is that they're not going to overturn Chevron, They may modify it, but I'm skeptical that they'll overturn it outright. Chevron's a funny doctrine. It's been around for 40 years, but it's not as though over that 40 years it hasn't gone through several different evolutions.

Not to mention the fact that you've never really had agreement among the justices about what Chevron is and how it functions. And you saw that in the oral argument in Loper Bright [Enterprises v. Raimondo] and Relentless [Inc. v. Department of Commerce].

When it comes to Treasury and IRS rulemaking No. 1, I'm not sure in the mine-run of regulation projects that Treasury is or even needs to be all that concerned about courts overruling what they're coming up with. Most tax regulations never see the inside of a courtroom, at least not in terms of substantive challenges, and there's evidence irrespective of whatever standard of review is used. There's evidence that courts vary the amount of deference they give in practice based to some extent on subject matter area, not explicitly by any stretch. But tax is one of those areas that you're going to see historically more deference rather than less, probably because of the complexity and just the nature of the topic in terms of judicial concerns when you're talking about generalist judges.

So when you put all of that together, I think that Treasury and the IRS may have a little bit less discretion in terms of boundary pushing. We can all point to some set of regulations where there's really some legitimate question about whether Treasury has the authority to regulate in a particular area. King v. Burwell comes to mind with the Affordable Care Act again, and of course the IRS won that case, but the mine-run of regulation projects just aren't like that case. In those marginal, boundary-pushing cases, then yeah, maybe Treasury and IRS will feel a little bit less room to navigate, but that's not most regs.

Libin Zhang: Yeah. So I would say we saw a little bit of this issue when a couple years ago the Supreme Court was looking at Auer deference, which is regulatory agencies interpreting their own regulations, and people thought, ""Oh, maybe the Auer deference doctrine would get overturned,"" which is analogous to Chevron, but instead, in Kisor, the Supreme Court just reined it in a little bit, but it still survives. So I think that's probably what's going to happen. It takes a more incremental step.

But even if they did overturn Chevron completely, let's say, it doesn't mean regulations are worthless. You still have Skidmore doctrine, which is that the courts will look at the expertise of the agency, use it as one of the factors in weighing these regulations. And under that standard, the government's still going to win, I imagine, most of the time, given its expertise on these issues.

Kristin Hickman: Yeah. I do think it's important to recognize that deference long predates Chevron. We've had judicial deference to agency interpretations of statutes since at least the 1930s under a variety of different labels. And I will add with respect to the reference to Kisor, during oral argument in Loper Bright and Relentless, Justice Barrett asked Solicitor General Prelogar what a ""Kisor-ized"" Chevron might look like, and the solicitor general proceeded to articulate a variety of different points. That, to be perfectly candid, sounds a lot, to me anyway, like how Chevron already operates. So that's one of the reasons why I'm a little bit skeptical that that much is really going to change on the ground.

Libin Zhang: I mean, there could be definitely situations where, under current Chevron, government's view is not the best reading, but it's reasonable and the Court will uphold it, whereas under a new doctrine, the Court will overturn it. But I think that just means, I feel, like Treasury and IRS should work harder to provide better justification for its roles, which is doing their job.

David D. Stewart: So does this tie in with the more scrutiny the regulations are getting under the Administrative Procedure Act as well?

Kristin Hickman: Oh, I think in broad terms, to some extent, yes. If you think about the trend as being concern about government overreach, particularly against the little guy, then anytime you're getting greater scrutiny of regulations, I think right now that's part of it.

I will make a note, though, that the greater scrutiny that Treasury regulations are getting under the Administrative Procedure Act is in tension with a different trend, at least among certain judges and justices, to interpret the administrative Procedure Act in a very hypertextualist kind of a way that actually limits some of the doctrines under that statute relative to how courts have applied them in the past. So you've got greater scrutiny in the tax area but maybe a little bit less scrutiny in some other areas as we reshape those doctrines, and so I tend to think tax is a little bit of an outlier there.

Libin Zhang: I think a lot of the APA challenges are on regulations that maybe are not within the language of the statute, like about the dividends received deduction, that's in the Liberty Global case, for example. And that just goes back to this issue, this thing that's always bothered me, which is on the one hand, we say under Chevron the federal government is an expert at all this and should get deference, but then on the other hand, the federal government is the one writing these statutes that have all these typos and glitches in the first place. Maybe they should have some of the experts work on the statute so that the issues are more covered and we don't have gaps and typos, so maybe Congress should work a little bit harder in writing better statutes in the first place.

Kristin Hickman: It's unfortunate that we've come to an era in which we don't get the technical corrections bills that we used to get because that did a lot. And instead we're relying on an agency to try to fix those issues with the drafting.

David D. Stewart: So given the reality of the world that we're living in now, what are you expecting? What should we be watching for in the future?

Kristin Hickman: So it's really hard to say. I mean, I've never been a great prognosticator when it comes to this stuff. And at the moment, we are in such a position of political realignment and upheaval as well as some real transitions in judicial decision-making, where the Supreme Court is more originalist, more textualist, more formalist than it has been in a century at least. And how you put all of that together is really difficult to predict what might come out of it.

I do think in the tax context — and to me this is a good thing, although I'm not sure that everyone agrees — we are seeing greater attention from Treasury and the IRS to, I think, transparency and accountability and when it comes to rulemaking, as well as they've got this new plan for making the IRS and the tax system, I think, more accessible to a broader array of people, and there's some transparency involved in that too.

So that's something from not a court side but from an administrative side; those are trends that I think are very positive.

Libin Zhang: Yeah. I think regardless of what happens with Chevron, I think one thing that we're going to see is more scrutiny about just the regulations that's coming out and whether they really are consistent with the statute, especially when the regulations go much beyond what the statute is saying.

For example, we have this new stock buyback tax, which the statute is, I don't know, like a page and a half. Treasury recently came out with 300 pages of final regulations. That's a lot in terms of the ratios there. And some of those rules maybe are not, are a little bit on the fringe there, and there might be some debate about challenging those.

So I think that's something that we'll see. Just maybe if Congress wants something to be spelled out, they should write it in the statute instead of leaving it to the regulators.

David D. Stewart: All right. Well, it sounds like we've got a lot to keep an eye on and a lot of interesting cases coming down the road. Kristin, Libin, thank you for being here.

Kristin Hickman: Thank you.

David D. Stewart: Thank you all.

Again, I'd like to thank my guests, Libin Zhang and Kristin Hickman, for joining me.","The image shows the front facade of the Supreme Court building with classical architecture, including columns and a statue of Lady Justice.

8585d31965,Newsweek,Jake Tapper Ripped for Joe Biden 'Save' During Debate - Newsweek,"Republicans are lashing out at CNN anchor Jake Tapper for his supposed efforts to ""save"" President Joe Biden during the first of two scheduled debates with former President Donald Trump.

The Context

Biden, 81, is frequently criticized over his advanced age and propensity for making verbal gaffes while speaking in public. While some of the president's missteps may be explained by the fact that he has had a stutter for nearly all of his life, the criticism has only increased with his age.

Tapper and CNN are also frequently accused by Republicans of harboring an anti-Trump bias, although both Trump and Biden agreed to the conditions of the debate, which include time limits for each candidate to speak, before it took place on Thursday.

What We Know

Biden seemingly lost his train of thought during the debate on Thursday while speaking about his plans for spending money saved by reversing Trump-era tax cuts that he said ""benefited the very wealthy.""

""We'd be able to wipe out his debt,"" Biden said. ""We'd be able to help make sure all those things we need to do: child care, elder care, making sure that we continue to strengthen our health care system.""

""Making sure that we're able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I've been able to do with the ... with the COVID, excuse me, with um, dealing with everything we have to with, uh ..."" he continued. ""Look, if we finally beat Medicare ...""

Tapper, who moderated the debate alongside co-anchor Dana Bash, was criticized by some for cutting the president off just after he mentioned Medicare.

""Thank you President Biden,"" Tapper said while Biden was seemingly mid-sentence. ""President Trump?""

Trump responded with the following: ""Well, he's right, he did beat Medicare. He beat it to death, and he's destroying Medicare.""

Newsweek reached out for comment to the Biden campaign via email on Thursday night.

Views

""@jaketapper saves Joe Biden again!"" former Trump administration official Richard Grenell wrote in a post to X, formerly Twitter. ""Biden glitched - he was mumbling. A real debate moderator would have jumped on it to 'what did you say?' Jake ends it and saves him.""

""Biden's brain glitches, forcing Jake Tapper to step in and save him,"" the ""End Wokeness"" X account wrote while sharing a video clip of the moment.

""Insane to see Jake Tapper save POTUS there,"" @sagesteele wrote. ""Biden lost his train of thought - he was lost - and Tapper saved him. SMH.""

""This is the moment Jake Tapper stepped in after Biden's brain malfunctioned,"" wrote conservative commentator Todd Starnes.

While some Trump supporters accused Tapper of attempting to help Biden, the anchor received praise from others for his handling of the debate on Thursday.

""Most impressive people at this debate so far: @JakeTapper and @DanaBashCNN,"" former CNN host Brian Stelter wrote.

""Much like a good boxing match, a good debate means you don't notice the referee,"" wrote pollster Frank Luntz. ""Kudos to moderators @JakeTapper and @DanaBashCNN so far.""

02e1cd458d,Financial Times,Can Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský get Royal Mail to deliver? - Financial Times,"Defending the government’s move to privatise Royal Mail in 2013, the then business secretary Vince Cable insisted it was “logical”.

The plan was “consistent with developments elsewhere in Europe”, he argued, where other privatised postal services “produce profit margins far higher than Royal Mail’s but provide high-quality services”.

A decade later, unlike many of its peers across Europe, Royal Mail has failed to deliver. The 508-year-old group has been beset by strikes, losses and late deliveries: it posted just 75 per cent of first-class mail on time during the 12 months to March compared with 92 per cent 11 years earlier.

The plunge in the share price of its owner, International Distribution Services (IDS), added to the woes, setting the stage for Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský to swoop.

On Wednesday, London-listed IDS said it had reached an agreement to sell its business to Křetínský’s EP Group for 370 pence per share, a significant discount on its 455p price after Royal Mail listed in 2013. The holding company changed its name to IDS in 2022.

With Royal Mail about to get a new owner, attention is turning to Křetínský’s chances of transforming the business. Analysts say he is about to take charge at a difficult time, with the need to pump more money into modernisation to catch up with European peers and capitalise on growing demand for online shopping deliveries.

“This is what makes it an interesting bid: we’re at a point of almost maximum uncertainty [for Royal Mail],” said Alexander Paterson, an analyst at Peel Hunt. Other postal services were “generally far further advanced” with automation of mail sorting, he added.

“That’s one thing I would expect to be accelerated if Royal Mail is owned privately by someone who is able to invest more capital,” Paterson said.

Křetínský, whose takeover bid will be scrutinised by politicians and regulators, faces a tough task in growing a business that must meet its universal service obligations of delivering items everywhere in the UK for the same price.

An example of a misfiring service was highlighted in north London during May’s local elections, when many voters in Hendon failed to receive their postal ballots in time, according to local councillor Mark Shooter. Other residents have reported delays including for hospital appointment letters.

Royal Mail said the problems in Hendon were a result of “resourcing issues”, adding that it had a recruitment plan in place and had made alterations to routes to help deliver a more reliable service.

But Hendon is not alone in complaints about a deteriorating service nationwide.

One of the biggest problems for the group is the sharp decline in letter deliveries following the rise of email, which has hit revenues. It delivered 20bn letters in the year to March 2005, compared with fewer than 7bn during the most recent year.

Indeed, setting out the plans for Křetínský’s takeover this month, IDS warned that Royal Mail’s long-standing obligation to deliver all letters six days a week was holding back its ability to provide an “economically sustainable service”.

With the shift in demand to parcels, the company has called for regulator Ofcom to cut second-class letter deliveries to three days per week, which it said would save up to £300mn annually and free up money for investment.

But even if it can persuade the regulator to make the change, Royal Mail needs to repair its fractured relationship with the roughly 110,000 workers who deliver its mail. Even after reaching a deal on pay and working terms following 18 days of strikes in 2022, low morale and high vacancies have continued to affect performance.

“This is incorrect . . . to say, in effect, the reason Royal Mail is vulnerable to this type of bid is the government not reforming the [universal service obligation],” said Dave Ward, general secretary of the postal workers’ union, which is eager to protect employment practices as the company faces competition from delivery groups that employ staff on lower wages and temporary contracts.

“They have grossly mismanaged [and] attacked their own workers,” he said.

Some business groups have also rejected Royal Mail’s excuses over falling letter deliveries.

David Falkner, a member of the council of the Greeting Card Association, pointed out that while the decline in letter volumes had mostly been steady, the fall-off in Royal Mail’s performance took place suddenly around the time of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Besides the disruption caused by the pandemic, he said the service had been undermined by the adoption in 2020 of a “Delivery to Specification” system, which allows the company to hold second-class mail until the last permissible day for delivery, in the hope other items for the same address will arrive.

“Something systemic has changed,” Falkner said, adding that his 3D pop-up card making business Cardology now sent them by more expensive tracked post. Previously, it had been devoting the equivalent of half an employee’s working week to dealing with customer queries about delays.

Royal Mail has insisted Delivery to Specification improves efficiency by reducing the number of visits that postal workers make to each address. It insists that, because it prompts staff to deliver items on the last permissible day, it had had no effect on service quality.

Although stressing the company’s regulatory requirements had been a “heavy burden”, Peel Hunt’s Paterson said it had “under invested” as a publicly listed business. “I’ve always been surprised [that] Royal Mail has kept [its range of services] narrow,” he said.

With a vast network of postal workers already regularly visiting addresses nationwide, it could expand its services at relatively low cost, potentially collecting more online shopping returns or delivering food, he explained.

However, Křetínský has already laid out plans to plough money into Royal Mail, saying a key ambition is to invest in parcel lockers that enable consumers to collect purchases at their own convenience, an increasingly popular service offered by the likes of Amazon that has eaten into the group’s market share.

Dutch postal provider PostNL, in which Křetínský holds a roughly 30 per cent stake, had made significant progress on automation about eight years ago, while Royal Mail remained “in the early stages”, Paterson pointed out.

“That is something Křetínský might actually be able to help with,” he said.",A man in a suit and tie stands in front of a red background with a building that resembles a courthouse or a government building.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA41BB760>,2024-06-02 04:00:26.266000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/a2ba075d-7160-4f8a-818b-8dd32f82aa5a,['Business and Finance' 'National'],[0.95 0.75],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/02e1cd458d.png
a8e01b9f23,The Guardian US,The pros and cons of Kamala Harris: a progressive reformer forced to run on Biden’s record - The Guardian US,"After Joe Biden’s momentous decision on Sunday to step aside in the US presidential race, Democrats fell in line to describe him as a selfless American hero – and many of them echoed his endorsement of his vice-president, Kamala Harris.

One measure of the hope the decision to drop out and endorse Harris brought with it: stagnant donations immediately rocketed, and by Monday afternoon, Harris is likely to have raised more money in a 24-hour period than any other candidate in US history.

Biden’s endorsement plus the explicit support of many prominent figures in the party mean there is a very good chance she will run unopposed, or be a strong favourite even if someone stands against her. One potential candidate, Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, quickly said on Sunday that she would not stand; another governor, Gavin Newsom of California, has repeatedly said he would not stand against Harris. Both have endorsed her, along with more than 100 other elected Democrats.

In her favour is wariness among the Democratic establishment of a chaotic display to the public in an open battle at the convention – alongside worries that Black and female voters could turn away from the party if Harris were to be denied the nomination that some feel she has already earned. But how might she fare politically in a matchup against Donald Trump?

Harris’s strengths

Harris does a bit better than Biden in match-up polls against Trump: they were tied with 44% each in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll, giving her a two-point advantage over Biden in the same poll. She also has slightly higher approval ratings than Biden.

While those figures do not make an overwhelming case for her nomination, her supporters argue that they could quickly improve as she is introduced to the public with a unified and excited Democratic party behind her. And they point to her recent record on attacking Trump as well as being a prominent voice for Biden on abortion as evidence for the theory that she could be a nimble and energetic campaigner against the Republican candidate.

Harris is viewed as a moderate who succeeded in California with a “tough on crime” message before recasting herself as a progressive reformer. The contrast between a 59-year-old former prosecutor, who would be the first woman and the first woman of colour to be elected president, and a 78-year-old convicted criminal is another source of optimism, underlined by this ad from her 2020 campaign that was widely shared on Sunday. And Harris’s supporters hope that she could shore up Democratic support among the significant number of younger voters and people of colour who polls show have been drawn to Trump.

Another point in her favour is a highly practical one: it will be much simpler for her to access Biden’s hefty $240m war chest – and the significant funds now pouring in from donors who had suspended their contributions – than for any candidate who was not part of his campaign. Vox has a useful explainer of the significant hurdles facing any other candidate.

Harris’s weaknesses

While she looks like a stronger candidate than Biden, that’s a pretty low bar. Democrats who oppose her coronation as the nominee ask an obvious question: if we’re prepared to go through the pain of forcing Biden out, surely we shouldn’t then nominate his vice-president by default?

That argument is bolstered by the evidence of Harris’s previous run at the presidency, which sputtered out after her support fell into the low single digits and saw her described by the New York Times as “an uneven campaigner who changes her message and tactics to little effect”.

This Washington Post piece from Saturday reports that many of her supporters say she has become a far more effective political communicator and strategist since then. But she struggled to carve out an effective role in the vice-presidency, too, being saddled with a difficult policy portfolio including immigration and the failed voting rights bill, where Biden eventually cut her out of negotiations with lawmakers.

Perhaps the most fundamental problem for Harris: in what could be a “change” election, she will have to run on Biden’s record. So far, the Republican playbook appears to be to link her to it indelibly, and to claim that she failed to warn the public about Biden’s allegedly declining faculties.","A woman stands at a podium with the seal of the President of the United States, addressing an audience with American flags in the background and the logo of The Guardian on the podium.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BC774FB50>,2024-07-22 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/22/kamala-harris-pros-cons-democrats,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/a8e01b9f23.png
934e14542d,Newsweek,Robert F. Kennedy Jr. May Still Be on the Ballot in 23 States - Newsweek,"Despite independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dropping out of the race and endorsing former President Donald Trump, his name could still appear on the ballot in more than 20 states in November.

Kennedy, arguably known as well for his promotion of anti-vaccine conspiracy theories as for his famous family name, said during a news conference in Arizona on Friday that he had made the ""heart-wrenching decision"" to ""suspend"" his campaign and ""support President Trump"" because he believes that the ex-president will help end a ""chronic disease epidemic"" among children.

Before withdrawing from the race, Kennedy's name was set to appear on the ballot in at least 23 states. He had already withdrawn his name from Arizona's ballot by Friday, while in New York, a judge previously removed his name from the ballot due to a dispute over his listed residence.

In the other 25 states, the Kennedy campaign launched petitions to put his name on the ballot. While the campaign did not acquire enough signatures to appear on the ballot in Kentucky, Mississippi, Rhode Island and Wyoming, petitions were pending in 21 other states, according to CBS News.

On Friday, Kennedy said that he would be attempting to remove his name or withdraw from the ballot ""in about 10 battleground states"" where he could be a ""spoiler"" candidate and worsen Trump's chances of winning, while also urging supporters to vote for him in red and blue states because he believes he could still become president ""in a contingent election.""

Kennedy's name was set to appear on the ballot in the following 23 states just before suspending his campaign:

Alaska

California

Colorado

Delaware

Hawaii

Indiana

Iowa

Louisiana

Maine

Michigan

Minnesota

Nebraska

New Mexico

North Carolina

Oklahoma

Oregon

South Carolina

Tennessee

Texas

Utah

Vermont

Washington

West Virginia

It was unclear which 10 battleground states Kennedy was referring to when he mentioned withdrawing his name from ballots. Of the states where his name was confirmed to appear, only Michigan and North Carolina are considered by most to be swing states this year.

A spokesperson for Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said that Kennedy's name would remain on the state's ballots in November due to his status as a ""minor party"" candidate, according to a post from ABC News reporter Will McDuffie on X, formerly Twitter.

Newsweek reached out for comment to the Kennedy campaign via email on Friday.

Kennedy filed a petition earlier on Friday to remove his name from a potential ballot appearance in Pennsylvania, where his candidacy was in doubt due to a court battle. He may also attempt to withdraw active petitions in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Wisconsin.

Deadlines to withdraw candidacy routinely have already passed in some states, including in Pennsylvania, although withdrawals could likely still be achieved by court order.

It is unclear where Kennedy's name may have already been printed on ballots. Early voting is more than a month away in most of the states where his name is confirmed to appear, although North Carolina begins sending absentee ballots to voters who requested them on September 6.

CBS News contributor David Becker said in a series of posts to X on Friday that ""ballots are already being printed"" in some states, including North Carolina.

Five of Kennedy's siblings, who are Democrats like their father—former Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and uncle, former President John F. Kennedy—released a statement on Friday denouncing their brother's decision to endorse Trump.

""We want an America filled with hope and bound together by a shared vision of a brighter future, a future defined by individual freedom, economic promise and national pride,"" RFK Jr.'s siblings said, according to CNN's Manu Raju. ""We believe in Harris and Walz.""

""Our brother Bobby's decision to endorse Trump today is a betrayal of the values that our father and family hold most dear,"" they added.

5aa75bc0a2,CNN,"US intelligence assesses Houthis in Yemen in talks to provide weapons to al-Shabaab in Somalia, officials say - CNN","US intelligence has learned of discussions between Houthis in Yemen to provide weapons to the Somali militant group al-Shabaab, in what three American officials described to CNN as a worrying development that threatens to further destabilize an already violent region.

Officials are now searching for evidence that Houthi weapons have been delivered to Somalia, and are trying to work out whether Iran, which provides some military and financial support to the Houthis, is involved in the agreement.

The US has been warning countries in the region about this possible cooperation in recent weeks, according to a senior administration official, and African countries have also begun to proactively bring it up with the US to raise their concerns and get more information.

“This is a pretty active area of conversation that we’re having with countries on both sides of the Red Sea,” this person said. “And it’s being viewed with a considerable seriousness.”

It’s not a natural alliance for the two groups, which are divided by sectarianismand are not known to have had a relationship in the past. The Houthis are Zaydi Shiites, and al-Shabaab traditionally has been deeply ideologically opposed to Shiism. But they are separated by only a single body of water — the strategically significant Gulf of Aden — and they both count the United States as a top enemy.

The intelligence raises the alarming possibility that a marriage of convenience could make things worse both in Somalia and in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, where the Houthis have launched regular attacks on commercial shipping and US military assets since the war in Gaza began.

A potential deal could offer a new stream of financing for the Houthis, at a time when US officials say there are signs that the group’s primary patron, Iran, has some concerns about the group’s attack strategy. “Being able to sell some weapons would bring them much needed income,” the senior administration official said.

For al-Shabaab, it could provide access to a new source of weapons — including potentially drones — that are far more sophisticated than their current arsenal and could offer the group the ability to strike US targets.

There has been some routine smuggling of both small arms and commercial material between different groups in Yemen and Somalia for years. But a weapons agreement between al-Shabaab and the Houthis would be something new, according to US officials.

“It would be the clearest sign that two organizations that are, ideologically, diametrically opposed to one another — that they prioritized something they have in common, which is hostility towards [the United States],” said Christopher Anzalone, a professor at the Marine Corps University’s Middle East Studies department. “It would be very significant because it shows there is a level of pragmatism in both organizations.”

Any form of military cooperation between the Houthis and al-Shabaab could also undermine an informal, and fragile, ceasefire between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia that has held since 2022, the senior administration official said. And it would “definitely” go against the spirit of a proposed UN roadmap for a more lasting peace, the official said.

“We still have a strong interest in supporting the roadmap process in Yemen,” the official added, “but this sort of trafficking between the Houthis” and al-Shabaab “would certainly complicate and undermine that effort.”

Officials say at this point, they aren’t sure what kinds of weapons the Houthis might provide to al-Shabaab. Right now, the Somali group generally only has access to rockets, mortars and homemade IEDs that it has used in its fight against the Somali government — deadly, but relatively smaller arms. The Houthis, by comparison, have weaponized drones, including underwater drones. They also have short-range ballistic missiles. There is a sense that the deal would cover “bigger kit” than just rockets and mortars, said one US official, but beyond that, the intelligence is murky.

No matter what the Houthis provide, there’s likely limited opportunity for al-Shabaab to fire directly at US assets in the region. Even if the Houthis were to provide them with some of the smaller missiles the group has used to target US MQ-9 drones, Anzalone said, al-Shabaab would likely have to fire them from the north of the country. Pockets of that region of the country are controlled by an increasingly powerful branch of ISIS. Al-Shabaab is often fighting to contest territory there, and as a result, has a much more limited presence and freedom to maneuver.

“They would love to do that,” Anzalone said, referring to striking directly at US assets. Al-Shabaab views the internationally recognized government of Somalia as a puppet of the United States. But, he said, “I think they would find it hard to do. This is where the intra-jihadist fighting between Shabaab and ISIS is the heaviest.”

The US has about 480 US troops in Somalia, according to a US official. The US has continued to carry out counterterrorism strikes against both al-Shabaab and ISIS targets in Somalia throughout the Biden administration.

One major question for US intelligence officials is the degree of involvement Iran might have in the arrangement. There is no direct evidence yet, officials said, but the US is still looking. It fits the pattern of broader Iranian efforts to widen the front against the US and the west by directly or indirectly providing arms to proxy groups.

“That’s something we definitely have our eyes on,” the senior administration official said.

But the Houthis are also one of the most independent-minded of the different Iran-aligned groups and are the one over which Tehran exercises arguably the least amount of control. Iran broadly has sought to tightly manage any potential escalation arising from the war in Gaza, calibrating its response to extract costs from the US and Israel without allowing it to spiral into direct conflict.

And so some US officials are skeptical Iran is involved.

“Don’t think Iran is actually part of this,” said one military official. “Houthis be a’ Houthi-ing on their own.”","A group of armed individuals holding flags, with the central figure prominently displaying a flag with red, white, and black stripes, against a clear blue sky.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BC75D09D0>,2024-06-11 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/us-intelligence-houthis-al-shabaab/index.html,['International' 'Politics'],[0.95 0.9 ],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/5aa75bc0a2.png

During an interview with The Atlantic published on Tuesday, Phillips said he had heard from others in the party that Harris may not be the right choice as president in the event that Biden cannot serve out his term. Phillips added in his interview that he had not personally ""seen those deficiencies"" in Harris and was only repeating comments he had heard from others. ""I hear from others who know her a lot better than I do that many think she's not well positioned,"" he said. ""She is not well prepared, doesn't have the right disposition and the right competencies to execute that office."" In response to the backlash, Phillips took to X to apologize to the vice president, saying that he ""shouldn't have referenced other people's opinions."" ""i owe an apology. in the atlantic, i shared kind words about @VP harris because that's been my personal experience and i respect her. i shouldn't have referenced other people's opinions. i own that and apologize to her and everyone who's been affected by similar circumstances,"" he wrote. Meanwhile, according to a poll conducted by Yahoo News/YouGov that was published last week, 54 percent of Democratic primary voters wish to see ""another Democrat"" enter the 2024 race over Biden. In the same poll, however, both of Biden's current Democratic challengers—Phillips and author Marianne Williamson—polled at just 4 percent each. The president was supported by 64 percent of those surveyed.","A man in a blue suit stands at a podium with a microphone, gesturing with his right hand.

1949d2971b,CNN,Endangered Republicans gamble backing Trump after guilty verdict as vulnerable Democrats remain cautious - CNN,"For more on how vulnerable Republicans are grappling with former President Donald Trump’s conviction, watch “Inside Politics Sunday with Manu Raju” at 8 a.m. and 11 a.m. ET.

Former President Donald Trump lost Rep. Mike Garcia’s district by more than 12 points four years ago. And that was before he was convicted on 34 felony charges.

But that doesn’t mean the California Republican is abandoning Trump.

“No,” Garcia said when asked if the conviction shook his confidence in his party’s standard bearer. “I mean, the alternative is Joe Biden. There’s obviously no way I can support four more years of Joe Biden.”

Garcia is hardly alone. In many bellwether districts that will determine the next House majority, including in the 19 GOP districts Biden carried in 2020, Republicans are quickly falling in line behind Trump.

And they’re echoing his line that the New York hush money trial was unfair and that he’s a victim being persecuted, aligning with a riled-up base and effectively gambling that swing voters won’t punish them for backing a felon at the top of the ticket.

“My district is full of very smart people with a firm grasp of reality,” said Rep. John Duarte, a fellow California Republican whose district Biden carried by 13 points four years ago. “They can smell bullsh*t.”

In past eras of politics, candidates in difficult races would be quick to distance themselves from a presidential contender with a hint of baggage – let alone one who has been convicted of a crime. But in the Trump era, Republicans have calculated that it pays dividends to stay on the team as vulnerable House and Senate Democrats are tiptoeing around Trump’s conviction – and keeping their distance from Biden.

Yet while GOP party committees are seeing a surge of fundraising after the verdict, senior Republicans are wary that going too far over Trump’s legal woes – and embracing his talk about retribution against his enemies – could overwhelm their message in the fall as they try to woo disaffected Biden voters who will be central to holding onto their narrow majority in the House.

“I think we need to be focused on the issues that the American people care about: The economy, open border, and crime,” said Rep. Richard Hudson, the North Carolina Republican who chairs the House GOP’s campaign arm. While he called the verdict a “political hit job,” Hudson added: “I think this election ultimately is going to be decided on the issues.”

House Democratic leaders say they are more than happy that vulnerable Republicans have defended Trump after the guilty verdict.

“I think the ones who fall in line are Republicans who seem to do everything to show their blind loyalty to Donald Trump,” said Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington state, who chairs the House Democrats’ campaign arm. “People want folks who are going to stand up for their communities, who are going to stand up to govern, and who are true voices for their community.”

George Whitesides, the Democratic candidate seeking to defeat Garcia in the fall, said that his GOP foe’s handling of Trump’s conviction is an issue he will hammer home.

“It is remarkable that Mike Garcia who says he’s supportive of the American law enforcement system has no concerns of someone who has been convicted of 34 felonies,” Whitesides said. “I can tell you the people of the 27th District of California have huge concerns about it.”

Garcia said that the choice boils down to “Joe Biden who’s the worst president in the history of the country” and someone “who’s got a proven track record, pro-security, pro-law enforcement,” referring to Trump.

Several other vulnerable members made clear where they stood.

“Well, he’s the Republican nominee. I’m the Republican,” said Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, whose Oregon district Biden won by eight points in 2020, confirming she’s sticking with Trump after his conviction.

Rep. Mike Lawler, whose New York district Biden carried by 10 points, sharply criticized the prosecution against Trump. And he pointedly said: “I already said I am” when asked if he still backs Trump at the top of his ticket.

“Look, the process itself will play out in court,” Lawler told CNN. “But again, when you have an election that will be determined by the American people, a nomination that was determined by Republican primary voters, you respect the process.”

Endangered Democrats sidestep on Trump verdict

Vulnerable incumbent Democrats are taking a different approach – particularly House members from districts that Trump carried and Senate Democrats in red and purple states.

They are saying little about the verdict as they try to court Trump voters, instead trying to raise character concerns about their GOP opponents while campaigning on economic issues like prescription drug prices and social issues like abortion.

In Ohio and Montana, two states that Trump carried twice, GOP candidates Bernie Moreno and Tim Sheehy are attacking Democrats Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester over the conviction. Sheehy is already up with a campaign ad accusing Tester of standing by prosecutors who are trying to “throw Trump in jail.”

In an interview last week, Tester struck a neutral tone when asked if he agreed with the verdict.

“What I agree on is nobody is above the law,” Tester said. “He went through the process, trial by jury of his peers. And he has right to appeal it.”

Asked about GOP demands that he condemn the verdict, Tester said: “Look, the Republicans think that I’m the one who sat on the jury, for Christ’s sake, OK? They’re grasping at straws on that one.”

Brown said even less.

“I’ve put out a statement,” Brown said last week. “I said what I said.”

In that statement, Brown also said that “no one is above the law” and that “it’s up to the legal system to sort” out before voters ultimately decide in November.

Other vulnerable Democrats were also cautious.

“The jury made a decision and that’s their decision,” said Sen. Bob Casey, a Democrat of Pennsylvania, when asked if he agreed with the verdict. “And we’ll see what the next step is.”

GOP divide over Trump’s talk of retribution

In the days following Trump’s conviction, Republicans have brought forward an onslaught of proposals, including to defund federal and state prosecutions targeting Trump, threatening a government shutdown and a longshot impeachment of Biden.

Those actions and rhetoric have some Republicans worried that the party could get itself off message ahead of November.

GOP Rep. Nick LaLota, a Republican running in a competitive New York district Biden won in 2020, cautioned his Republican colleagues against engaging in a “tit-for-tat” revenge scheme that reaches beyond targeting Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.

“We shouldn’t overreact or misreact by acting upon things that had nothing to do with this hasty trial,” LaLota, who rallied behind Trump after the verdict, told CNN.

And Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, who is close to Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, warned his GOP colleagues that it would be a “big mistake” to shift their focus away from kitchen table issues like the economy and the Biden administration’s border policies as Republicans face the final stretch to November.

“Those are the key issues that are driving voters in November,” Tillis said. “Why on earth, we would shift our attention away from that, for any sort of quick fix on this decision doesn’t make sense to me.”

Right-wing members, however, have gone full steam ahead in throwing their entire congressional and messaging weight behind Trump in the wake of his conviction.

In a closed-door meeting with the GOP conference on Tuesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson presented a three-pronged approach for how Republicans could use their majority in the House to go after the Department of Justice and state prosecutors, according to multiple sources.

House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan also outlined his proposal for defunding federal and state prosecutions targeting “political opponents,” which he also detailed in a letter.

While Johnson has previously dismissed calls to defund key parts of the DOJ – a move that would be dead arrival in the Senate – Jordan said he believes Johnson has been warming up to the idea in recent days, especially after Trump’s conviction.

Separately, GOP Rep. Chip Roy suggested to CNN that initiating a government shutdown fight should be “on the table,” in the wake of Trump’s conviction.

“I’ll walk into the election, and I’ll message that,” Roy said.

One of Trump’s loudest supporters on the Hill, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, marched into Johnson’s office later Tuesday with an accountability list of her own, including a long-shot effort to impeach Biden.

“Republicans across the country, and many Americans in general, are sick and tired and fed up with a feckless, useless Republican Party and conference that does nothing,” Greene said after her meeting with Johnson.

Republicans in this camp believe there is no limit to how hard they can lean in to talking about Trump’s conviction and see the Trump verdict as a golden ticket.

GOP Rep. Ralph Norman, a Republican hardliner from South Carolina, said Republicans would “absolutely” retaliate against Trump’s political enemies after November, including prosecutors.

“What they’ve done is, is weaponized process,” Norman said. “What they’ve done is wrong, against the Constitution. That will happen.”

3966a91f1b,The Guardian,Labour rejects JD Vance ‘first Islamist country with nuclear weapons’ remarks - The Guardian,"Senior Labour figures have rejected comments by Donald Trump’s vice-presidential pick, JD Vance, that the UK could become the first “truly Islamist country that will get a nuclear weapon” under the party.

They were reacting to comments that were made by Vance, a junior senator for the state of Ohio who has been announced as Trump’s running mate, at a conference for US conservatives.

Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, told ITV that Vance had said “quite a lot of fruity things in the past” and she looked forward to meeting him and Trump if they won the US election in November.

“I don’t recognise that characterisation. I’m very proud of the election success that Labour had recently,” she said. “We won votes across all different communities, across the whole of the country, and we’re interested in governing on behalf of Britain and also working with our international allies.”

The jibe is likely to be embarrassing for the UK’s foreign secretary, David Lammy, who has attempted to build bridges with Vance in recent months, comparing their impoverished childhoods.

Vance was speaking at the National Conservatism conference last week, where he said: “I have to beat up on the UK – just one additional thing. I was talking with a friend recently and we were talking about, you know, one of the big dangers in the world, of course, is nuclear proliferation, though, of course, the Biden administration doesn’t care about it.

“And I was talking about, you know, what is the first truly Islamist country that will get a nuclear weapon, and we were like, maybe it’s Iran, you know, maybe Pakistan already kind of counts, and then we sort of finally decided maybe it’s actually the UK, since Labour just took over.”

The Treasury minister James Murray said: “I don’t know what he was driving at in that comment, to be honest. I mean, in Britain, we’re very proud of our diversity.”

Labour also found an unlikely ally in the form of Andrew Bowie, the shadow veterans minister, who said he “absolutely” disagreed with the claim that Labour would create an “Islamist country”. “I disagree with the Labour party fundamentally on many issues, but I do not agree with that view, quite frankly. I think it’s actually quite offensive, frankly, to my colleagues in the Labour party,” he told Times Radio.

Lammy described Vance as a friend in a short speech he gave at the Hudson Institute in May when he was in opposition.

The two also shared a panel in February at the Munich security conference, where Vance referred to Lammy as “my English friend” and, in the context of Trumpian pressure for European allies to increase their contributions to Nato, said: “England has been one of the few exceptions where it has fielded a very capable military over the last generation.”

During his time as a backbench MP, Lammy had often been highly critical of the former US president. “Trump is not only a woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath,” he wrote at the time. “He is also a profound threat to the international order that has been the foundation of western progress for so long.”

He has since suggested the US and UK must find ways to work together under a potential return to the presidency for Trump, saying of his past remarks: “You’re going to struggle to find any politician in the western world who hasn’t had things to say in response to Donald Trump.”

Vance was announced as Trump’s choice for vice-president on Monday night, days after the former president narrowly escaped an assassination attempt at a campaign rally. He was previously a harsh critic of Trump and condemned his Islamophobic rhetoric.

“Trump makes people I care about afraid. Immigrants, Muslims, etc. Because of this I find him reprehensible. God wants better of us,” he wrote in October 2016.

But Vance has become one of the most prominent young Conservatives on the New Right who are now big backers of Trump, having gained Trump’s endorsement for his senate run in Ohio. He is a fierce critic of Washington’s support for Ukraine against the Russian invasion and his appointment is likely to be met with apprehension in Brussels.

Vance played an important role in a failed attempt to block a bill for more Ukrainian aid this year in the Senate. He said in a speech at the time that he did not believe the extent of the threat the Russian president posed to Europe.",An older man in a blue suit and red tie stands in front of a blurred background with another man clapping in the foreground.

fbf81a0fd6,The New York Times,Trump’s Debate Performance: Relentless Attacks and Falsehoods - The New York Times,"For most of Thursday night’s debate, former President Donald J. Trump verbally pummeled President Biden, painting his political opponent as an ineffective leader with a torrent of attacks that were frequently false, lacked context or were vague enough to be misleading.

Mr. Trump went directly after Mr. Biden’s personal character, calling him “weak” and little respected by global leaders who were “laughing” at him.

He tried to accuse Mr. Biden of corruption, dubbing the president as a “Manchurian candidate” who was “paid by China,” a nod to frequent accusations of undue influence for which there is no evidence.

He directly blamed Mr. Biden for a wave of immigrants “coming in and killing our citizens at a level we’ve never” seen, a hyperbolic claim that is not backed up by available statistics.

Mr. Trump’s remarks during the debate were not substantially different from the way he typically inveighs against Mr. Biden during his rallies, where he depicts the president as a leader who is somehow both bumbling and corrupt as he steers the country to ruin.

But the barrage of attacks during the debate was particularly striking given that Mr. Biden was standing mere feet away from him, unable to interrupt or effectively challenge Mr. Trump because of debate rules that kept his microphone muted.

And as the debate’s moderators, the CNN anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, focused on keeping the peace, they did not even try to fact-check Mr. Trump’s assertions, allowing them to stand unchallenged.

Mr. Biden got in a few licks, including some of the debate’s more memorable moments. He said Mr. Trump had the “morals of an alley cat” and accused him of having sex with a porn star while his wife was pregnant.

But by and large, Mr. Biden was on the defensive from the get-go in the face of a steady stream of insults, false characterizations and attacks from Mr. Trump.

Seizing on Mr. Biden’s halting speech early in the debate, Mr. Trump pounced at one moment when Mr. Biden trailed off, saying: “I really don’t know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don’t think he knows what he said, either.”

But Mr. Trump’s most forceful attacks surrounded immigration, an issue that animated his successful 2016 campaign and that he has tried to put at the center of his bid to return to the White House.

Mr. Trump accused his successor of “ridiculous, insane and very stupid policies” that fostered a crime wave, pointing to high-profile killings that involved immigrants. He vaguely accused Mr. Biden of killing “so many at our border” by not curbing the surge of migrants, an assertion that he did not back up with statistics.

Experts have said that those heavily publicized cases do not represent a broader trend. Studies have concluded that immigration does not push up crime rates.

Mr. Trump also went directly after Mr. Biden’s profile on the world stage. He argued that Mr. Putin was “laughing at” the president’s leadership and at his failure to secure the release of Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter detained in Russia on an espionage charge that American officials vehemently deny.

“Our whole country is exploding because they don’t respect you,” Mr. Trump told Mr. Biden.

He extended those criticisms to the military, arguing that “our veterans and our soldiers can’t stand” the president. (Mr. Trump, while in office, reportedly denigrated senior American military officials.)

In repeating his frequent assertions that Mr. Biden is corrupt, Mr. Trump revived his accusations that Mr. Biden improperly received payments from a Chinese energy company associated with his son Hunter and his brother James. There is no evidence that any portion of those payments — which started after Mr. Biden left the vice presidency — went to the president.

But Mr. Trump also directly attacked Hunter Biden, who was found guilty this month on three felony counts related to his buying a gun while grappling with drug addiction. He called Hunter “a convicted felon at a very high level.”

Mr. Trump was convicted last month on 34 felony charges in Manhattan related to hush-money payments to a porn star.","A man in a suit stands at a podium with a microphone, gesturing with his right hand, in front of a backdrop with the CNN logo repeated across it.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x117 at 0x7D6BA256E770>,2024-06-27 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/us/politics/trump-debate-performance-falsehoods.html,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/fbf81a0fd6.png
ee18c56d8f,The Washington Post,Opinion | Six experts weigh in on the ICC’s warrants on Israeli and Hamas leaders - The Washington Post,"On Monday, Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, announced that he was seeking arrest warrants for both Israeli and Hamas senior officials on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Post Opinions asked six experts for their view of the decision.

Avi Mayer: The ICC has united Israel in opposition

In the immediate aftermath of the pogrom perpetrated by Hamas on Oct. 7, Israelis of all backgrounds and beliefs came together in a demonstration of unity seldom seen in this country. The impassioned debates of the preceding months seemed to vanish overnight as the country rallied behind efforts to support the victims of the carnage and the families of the hostages — and to ensure that Hamas can never again carry out a comparable massacre.

As the war against Hamas dragged on, however, deep disagreements arose about its direction, postwar planning and the price that ought to be paid to free the hostages still held by Hamas. The street protests of last summer have returned in force, and fissures have developed in Israel’s war cabinet, threatening the government’s stability and the country’s internal cohesion.

That is, until Monday.

International Criminal Court prosecutor Karim Khan’s announcement that he will seek arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant alongside Hamas leaders Yehiya Sinwar, Ismail Haniyeh and Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri (better known as Mohammed Deif) has produced a groundswell of anger and indignation that has united the country once again. Netanyahu’s political foes and potential challengers have rallied to his defense, and 106 of the Knesset’s 120 members — including most of the opposition — have signed a statement slamming Khan’s apparent comparison of Israel’s leaders to the mass murderers of Hamas as “scandalous … an indelible historic crime and a clear expression of antisemitism.”

To Israelis, the suggestion of moral equivalence between their democratically elected government — no matter how much they might detest it — and a terrorist group that openly and actively seeks their destruction is repulsive and contemptible. The notion that any comparison could possibly be drawn between the Jewish state, endeavoring to defend itself in the wake of the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, and the perpetrators of that very massacre — who have promised to repeat it “time and again” until that state is annihilated — is horrifying.

The world might have moved on from Oct. 7, but Israelis have not. A nation that just this week buried the mutilated bodies of four of its people brutally murdered that terrible day will not soon countenance attempts to deny it the right of self-defense. Any effort to tie Israel’s hands while comparing it to the cruel and implacable foe against which it is defending itself will be met with wall-to-wall resistance and steely determination.

Kenneth Roth: Biden’s response harms U.S. interests

The Biden administration’s reasons for condemning the International Criminal Court’s move against Israel and Hamas are confounding. It appears to be grasping for a way to defend senior Israeli officials for their starvation strategy in Gaza — a strategy that senior U.S. officials themselves have repeatedly decried.

President Biden called chief prosecutor Karim Khan’s request for arrest warrants for senior Israeli officials “outrageous,” noting that “there is no equivalence — none — between Israel and Hamas.” But Khan did not say there was equivalence; he simply charged both sides for their separate crimes. The dual charges help underscore that war crimes by one side never justify war crimes by the other.

Biden also said the United States “will always stand with Israel against threats to its security.” But the issue is how Israel defends itself. No defense justifies war crimes.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken claimed without elaborating that “the ICC has no jurisdiction.” He could be referring to the old U.S. argument that the court cannot charge nationals of governments that have not joined it, even if they commit crimes on the territory of a government that has. Israel has not joined the ICC, though the Palestinian territories have. But Biden abandoned that argument when he called the ICC’s use of territorial jurisdiction to prosecute Russian President Vladimir Putin “justified.”

Or, Blinken might be alluding to the view that Palestine should not have been allowed to join the court. But the ICC judges have already rejected that argument, based on the U.N. General Assembly’s recognition of Palestine as a “non-member observer state.” Palestine has used that status to ratify a host of human rights treaties, which should be welcomed.

Blinken notes that the ICC, under the principle of complementarity, is supposed to defer to good-faith national prosecutorial efforts. But the Israeli government has never pursued war crimes charges against senior officials. Khan said he would reconsider his charges should that change.

Finally, Blinken says the ICC’s request “could jeopardize” efforts to reach a cease-fire. But, historically, war-crime charges have often facilitated peace by marginalizing hard-liners. They led, for example, to the Dayton peace accord for the Bosnia conflict. Khan is right to discount this contention.

Biden should reconsider this reflexive, if flimsy, defense of the Israeli government. It does enormous damage to his administration’s efforts to portray itself as a principled supporter of the rule of law.

John R. Bolton: The ICC is illegitimate

As I first wrote in 1998, the International Criminal Court is fundamentally illegitimate. Its illegitimacy is why America unsigned the court’s founding Rome Statute in 2002, and has kept its distance since.

Now, reawakening from a protracted irrelevance, the ICC has intervened in an ongoing conflict in which a vibrant democracy is defending itself from barbarians, seeking arrest warrants for both Hamas terrorists and for key Israeli officials on highly contentious charges.

The ICC’s existence rests on the fantasy that a court drifting somewhere in the international ether, untethered to any constitutional structure, unchecked by distinct legislative or executive authorities, and utterly unable to enforce its decisions, will somehow impose order on an anarchic world.

But the hard reality is that the ICC is at best meaningless, and at worst dangerous. For Americans, a purported court supervising its own prosecutors merges executive and judicial functions, which our forefathers rejected as dangerous to liberty. Certainly, the ICC’s Assembly of States Parties doesn’t supervise the court. And the absence of jury trials is obviously unacceptable.

ICC acolytes argue that “complementarity” protects sovereign nations against ICC overreach, by supposedly deferring to the state’s courts to prosecute any war crimes. But complementarity is merely an academic pretense that this prosecutor has revealed to be no protection at all: If the ICC can so easily second-guess the decisions of a democratic, rule-of-law state, then the ICC, not Israel, has controlling sovereignty.

What’s more, intervening while the war rages starkly reveals the prosecutor’s irresponsibility. Amid intense combat, with escalatory risks readily apparent, the indictment might well prolong the war. How wars end is a matter of power and politics; the pretensions of unaccountable “judges” at The Hague play no role.

Israel should receive full U.S. backing. Jerusalem and Washington should not cooperate in any way with the ICC, which would simply provide it a patina of legitimacy. In 2018, I laid out a road map for sanctions against the ICC if it pursued the United States or its allies, which Congress is now considering. If this is to be war with the ICC, let it begin here. The ICC has finally and irreversibly begun digging its own grave.

James A. Goldston: Biden must uphold international law

As someone who has served within the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, and whose organization has worked closely with the ICC, I welcome Monday’s announcement by the prosecutor.

The court has faced many tests in its first quarter-century. But this is the most important.

It is critical that the panel of judges now reviewing the prosecutor’s request for warrants do so independently, free from any threat or intimidation. And if they ultimately decide to issue one or more warrants, the United States and its allies must support the court, notwithstanding past U.S. objections to its jurisdiction over nationals of nonmember countries. Anything less would be a betrayal of the “international rules-based order” that Washington has proudly defended since Nuremberg.

Just last year, following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Biden administration and members of Congress applauded the ICC’s issuance of an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin for war crimes. Late in 2022, Congress passed legislation allowing ICC officials to conduct “investigative activities” in the United States “related” to Ukraine, even though Russia — like Israel and the U.S. — isn’t a state party to the court.

But in recent weeks, the White House made clear its opposition to ICC action, and 12 Republican senators went so far as to threaten to “target” the ICC prosecutor and his staff with “severe sanctions” and travel bans.

What’s the difference? The law has not changed. Nor has the imperative of holding to account those most responsible for grave crimes.

If warrants are issued, many topics will merit discussion: their impact on precarious peace negotiations, the unlikelihood that they will be executed anytime soon, and the opportunity for Israel to demonstrate that, contrary to past practice, its domestic judiciary is capable of — and willing to — hold senior leaders to account.

But what the world should not tolerate is impunity for war crimes. At a time of rising global concern about double standards, the United States will pay a price for appearing to pick and choose where the law should apply.

Noura Erakat: The ICC warrants are not about justice

The International Criminal Court is incapable of delivering justice. And while its request for arrest warrants bears out this cynical argument, it did set a significant precedent.

Significant flaws are built into the form and content of the ICC. For example, the court’s emphasis on individual criminal culpability, in contrast with the International Court of Justice, comes at the expense of scrutinizing state crimes and ideologies. The ICC also ignores the historical context, including significant power relations, for the sake of procedural due process. The Rome Statute, which established the court, does not consider colonialism to be a core crime, so the worst crimes committed by former colonial powers — here, Israel’s forced displacement and repression of Palestinians over decades — are beyond judicial reach.

So it is not surprising that the court requested warrants for three Hamas leaders but only two Israeli ones, and that it charged Hamas leaders with eight crimes and Israeli leaders with only seven. The court charges Hamas with sexual violence and mistreatment of hostages while remaining silent on sexual violence and other forms of torture inflicted on Palestinians in Israeli captivity.

All the charges are limited to acts committed on and since Oct. 7, even though the ICC initiated its investigation in 2021. Palestinian human rights organizations have been petitioning the court for the past nine years, documenting crimes committed during the Gaza March of Return in 2018 and 2019, Israeli military offensives in 2014 and 2021, and Israel’s 17-year siege, as well as the crime of settlement expansion in the West Bank. Despite all this, the court does not charge any Israelis with genocide or apartheid.

The warrants for Hamas leaders were predictable and expected. Not only did the political organization submit itself to the ICC’s jurisdiction, but Western governments are already punishing Hamas with economic sanctions and diplomatic marginalization. Israel, on the other hand, has long benefited from a global legal exception, thanks in large part to the United States’ defense at the U.N. Security Council.

The request for arrest warrants finally breaks the taboo on charging Israel and challenging the paradigm that has collapsed Jewish safety with Israeli state crimes. Although the warrants, on their own, will not bring justice, they have cracked the wall that has shielded Israel from accountability and obscured the crisis of the Palestinian right to life and dignity.

José Ramos-Horta: When is the cost of friendship too high?

On Dec. 7, 1975, my country, Timor-Leste, was invaded by our much larger neighbor, Indonesia. A few days earlier, I had traveled to New York to plead our cause at the United Nations. On Dec. 22, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution deploring the invasion and demanding the Indonesian forces withdraw. Nothing happened. We had no court to turn to for recourse. Over the next 24 years, one-third of our population would lose their lives. But throughout, we resisted hatred and never demonized the other side. Our fighters never harmed civilians, women or children. Peace came about when Indonesia opened up for democracy and accepted Timor-Leste’s independence.

The International Criminal Court did not exist when we needed it. But it might hold hope for those Israelis and Palestinians whose lives have been considered expendable.

I have long been a friend of Israel. After Timor-Leste achieved independence in 2002, one of the early acts of our new government was to recognize Israel. I am also a friend of the Palestinians. I have traveled to both Israel and the West Bank on official visits. I knew my fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shimon Peres and, of course, closely followed the work of Nobel Peace Prize laureates Menachem Begin, Anwar Sadat and Yitzhak Rabin, two of whom gave their lives working for a just resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The Abraham Accords, between Israel and several Arab states, were a “peace deal” between parties that had not been at war — a transaction for the financial benefit of the countries involved and a supposed resolution of an extremely complex issue by a diplomat whose background was in real estate deals. The Palestinians would simply be discarded, their humanity monetized. This shady deal was shattered by the violence of Hamas on Oct. 7, followed by the obliteration of Gaza by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Friends become accomplices when they stay silent in the face of crimes — such as the slaughter of teenagers at a music festival, the killing of U.N. and World Central Kitchen workers, and the bombing of areas where civilians are sheltering. Many Western democracies have discredited themselves by making excuses for what are war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Neither side of this conflict deserves what its leaders have wrought. Peace is never an impossibility. Friends of Israelis and Palestinians must encourage them to rise up from hatred and wars and share the Holy Land.

8c9a8d8e35,CNN,Noticed a lot of DNC speeches mentioning moms? There’s a reason for that - CNN,"A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.

Michelle Obama paralleled her own story with Vice President Kamala Harris by comparing their mothers on Tuesday night, drawing on a theme that has laced throughout the Democratic National Convention.

Obama told delegates in Chicago that the last time she was in her home city, it was to memorialize her mother, Marian Robinson, who died in late May and “who set my moral compass high and showed me the power of my voice.”

Robinson was also, in Obama’s telling, “glad to do the thankless, unglamorous work that for generations, has strengthened the fabric of this nation.”

Obama tied her mother’s values to those of Harris’ mother, Shyamala Gopalan, who immigrated to the US from India, built a career as a medical researcher while raising her daughters and died in 2009. Harris frequently brings up her mother in speeches.

“She taught Kamala about justice, about our obligation to lift others up, about our responsibility to give more than we take,” Obama said.

She noted that Gopalan frequently told her daughter: “Don’t sit around and complain about things – do something!”

By the end of her speech Tuesday night, Obama had Democrats chanting that refrain: “Do something.”

Speaking next, former President Barack Obama returned to Robinson, the Black mother from the South Side of Chicago, who he said reminded him of his grandmother, “a little old White lady born in a tiny town called Peru, Kansas,” who “helped raise me as a child.”

His point was about the commonality of Americans and the importance of being good people. These women, from such different backgrounds, shared the same outlook, he argued.

“They knew what mattered,” he said. “Things like honesty and integrity, kindness and hard work. They weren’t impressed with braggarts or bullies. They didn’t think putting other people down lifted you up or made you strong.”

Both women “represented an entire generation of working people who, through war and depression, discrimination and limited opportunity, helped build this country,” he said.

The former president then seemed to riff on Donald Trump’s promise to “Make America Great Again,” arguing that rather than specific policies, Americans want a country where people look out for each other, a “restoration of what Lincoln called, on the eve of civil war, ‘our bonds of affection.’ An America that taps what he called ‘the better angels of our nature.’”

The Obamas followed the lead of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with their focus on maternal figures, although Clinton placed strong moms in the context of first getting women the right to vote and ultimately getting a woman elected president.

Speaking Monday night, Clinton told the convention that her mother Dorothy was born in Chicago before women could vote, a right they gained nationwide 104 years ago on August 18. She talked about taking her daughter to see Geraldine Ferraro, the vice presidential candidate who became the first woman on a major party ticket in 1984. And Clinton talked about the honor she felt at being the first woman to accept a major party’s presidential nomination in 2016.

“I wish my mother and Kamala’s mother could see us. They would say, ‘Keep going,’ surely,” Clinton said.

Praise for strong women is not isolated to Democrats this year. The Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance of Ohio said at the Republican National Convention in July that his own rise came only thanks to his Mamaw, “the name we hillbillies gave to our grandmothers.”

Bonnie Blanton Vance was the “guardian angel” who raised him when his mother struggled with addiction. Vance described her as a woman of contradictions, a Christian who “also loved the F word” and who hoarded guns in her house.

“Thanks to that Mamaw, things worked out for me,” Vance said.

But it is some other comments from Vance – made years ago on a cable TV show about Democrats without children, including Harris, who he called “childless cat ladies” – that may be more remembered from this campaign.

Speaking Tuesday night before the Obamas, Harris’ husband Doug Emhoff talked about the role Harris, who his two children call “Momala,” plays in their “big, beautiful, blended family,” which includes his ex-wife.

Democrats have played on the dad jokes of Emhoff and Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. But they have also had to contend with Walz’s misstatement of the fertility treatment his wife Gwen underwent in becoming pregnant with their two children, part of a larger conversation about protecting access to in vitro fertilization, even in states that have outlawed abortion.

Democrats are counting on women voters to swing toward Harris in November and make her the first woman president, so a focus on the role women play in society makes sense and is at the core of the version of freedom being pushed by Democrats.

“We believe that true freedom gives each of us the right to make decisions about our own life – how we worship, what our family looks like, how many kids we have, who we marry,” Barack Obama said on Tuesday.","Three women are shown speaking at podiums with microphones, with one woman in the center wearing a beige blazer and the other two on either side in darker outfits.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA430DDB0>,2024-08-21 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/21/politics/moms-grandmothers-dnc-what-matters/index.html,['Politics' 'National'],[0.9 0.7],Unlikely,Likely,sample_review/images/8c9a8d8e35.png
4046f664d9,Financial Times,"Ismail Kadare, Albanian author, 1936-2024 - Financial Times","Aged 35, Ismail Kadare was summoned in March 1971 to a private meeting with Enver Hoxha, Albania’s fearsome communist dictator. With a well-deserved reputation for murdering and imprisoning critics real and imagined, Hoxha had received word — perhaps from his Sigurimi security police — that Kadare planned to write a novel about the breakdown of Albanian-Soviet relations after Joseph Stalin’s death in 1953.

Kadare, regarded as Albania’s most accomplished living author, had never met Hoxha, who had ruled since 1944, and was never to meet him again. But even as one of eastern Europe’s most imaginative fiction writers, sometimes compared to Franz Kafka and George Orwell, he could not have predicted Hoxha’s behaviour on that evening.

“Not a single political slogan came out of his mouth during the three hours I was there with him,” Kadare, who has died at the age of 88, recalled in a 1998 interview. “When I left, he gave me some books as a present — a copy of Zacharie Mayani’s book on the origins of the Albanian language and the complete works of Balzac.”

Kadare’s ambiguous relationship with Hoxha and his regime, the most vicious and reclusive communist system in eastern Europe, prompted some writers to accuse him of lacking the bravery and integrity of dissident authors such as Václav Havel and Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Kadare rejected the charge, telling the French newspaper Le Monde in 2001: “Basically, what people ask me is how did I get out of the system alive? But you could have been shot for the tiniest things, so why should I have sacrificed myself?”

The lives of Kadare and Hoxha intersected in numerous ways. Both were born in the hilly southern town of Gjirokastër. Indeed, their families lived opposite each other on a street called Mad Men’s Alley. But whereas Hoxha (1908-85) studied and worked in France and Belgium before becoming Albania’s communist party leader during the second world war, Kadare, born in 1936, went in the 1950s to Moscow to study literature on a government scholarship.

Kadare was no apologist for communism. But he enjoyed privileges as a result of the international fame he acquired after his first novel, The General of the Dead Army, appeared in 1970 in a French translation. Kadare was allowed to travel abroad — something beyond the wildest dreams of almost all Albanians under Hoxha — and owned a Volkswagen Golf in a country where private cars belonged exclusively to the elite.

At times, his artistic talents got him into trouble. No sooner had Kadare’s novel on Albanian-Soviet relations appeared in 1973 under the title The Winter of Great Solitude than he came under attack for describing Albania as “solitary” — the regime vehemently denied it had cut itself off from most of the world. His portrayal of Hoxha next to characters such as street thugs and women of loose morals strayed from the prescriptions of “socialist realism”.

Such transgressions could have led to prison or worse, but Hoxha jumped to Kadare’s defence. The novel, though flawed, merely needed a few improvements, he said. Kadare duly supplied them, reissuing the book as The Great Winter. He later said he had faced three choices — “to conform to my own beliefs, which meant death; complete silence, which meant another kind of death; or to pay a tribute, a bribe.”

In 1981 he took a different, bolder approach with his masterpiece The Palace of Dreams, a novel ostensibly set in the Ottoman Empire that depicts a government office able to spy on people’s dreams. Albanian authorities banned it within weeks — but not before thousands of readers managed to buy copies.

Despite the novel’s barely disguised anti-totalitarian themes, Kadare insisted that he was not, fundamentally, a political writer. “I think that my writing is no more political than ancient Greek theatre. I would have become the writer I am in any political regime,” he said in 2009.

In 1990, five years after Hoxha’s death, Kadare requested political asylum in France. It was a less dramatic gesture than met the eye. By this time Albania’s communist system was losing its grip and was only months from collapse.","An older man in a white jacket and blue shirt stands in a room with a table displaying a clock, a vase, and a framed picture.

39625e48e2,USA TODAY,Democrats have decided to publicly label Donald Trump 'weird' and it's about time - USA TODAY,"At long last, Democrats have leaned into the word “weird.”

Vice President Kamala Harris, now the Democratic Party’s presumptive presidential nominee, has started using it to describe convicted felon and former President Donald Trump. It seems Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who’s on Harris’ vice presidential candidate list, led the charge, succinctly saying of Trump and his running mate this weekend: “These guys are just weird.”

There are millions upon millions of American voters ‒ certainly liberals and independents, and I’d bet a decent slice of conservatives ‒ who have spent the past eight or so years watching Trump and the MAGA circus and thinking: “Wow, this is all very weird.”

And it is.

Donald Trump is very, very weird, and we've known this for some time

The rise of Trumpism and the bizarre chaos it ushered in ‒ from family members lost down conspiratorial rabbit holes to the denial of facts and abandonment of shared reality ‒ has given us election lies and Trump-branded Bibles and Rudy Giuliani giving an insane news conference outside a landscaping business in Philadelphia and a dude called the QAnon Shaman wearing a horned fur cap as he joined an attack of the U.S. Capitol.

“Weird” may be the nicest possible description.

It’s certainly the most apt label for Trump and his unhinged rants, his nonsensical stories about sharks or Hannibal Lecter, his blabbering cruelty and unfiltered spouting of whatever odd thought passes through his hate-addled mind.

Kamala Harris should keep leaning into Trump's weirdness

It’s all weird. He’s surrounded by lackeys who are weird and go on Fox News and say weird things about Trump being the greatest president of all time. He is supported by slavish Republicans who once openly denounced him, and their hypocrisy is weird.

His running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, has a slew of past interviews in which he derided “childless cat ladies” and suggested the votes of people who have children should count more than the votes of those who don’t. And that’s all really weird. Plus, he has a tech-bro vibe that’s weird and impersonal ‒ but mainly weird.

Waiting on Trump:When is Trump's 'big boy press conference'? His campaign deflected when I asked.

Tim Walz, with Minnesota-nice, hit the nail on the head by calling Trump weird

Last week, Gov. Walz said on MSNBC, “These guys are just weird. They’re running for He-Man Women Haters Club or something. That’s what they’re doing. That’s just not what people are interested in.”

Yes. YES! Finally!

We've watched so much weirdness from Trump world over the years

We’ve spent years watching all-praise-be-to-Trump types getting three different kinds of worked up over drag queens and books about gay penguins and transgender school kids who just want to be allowed to exist.

The moment President Joe Biden stepped aside and endorsed Harris for the top of the ticket, MAGA Republicans started labeling her a “DEI candidate,” a blatantly racist description of an accomplished politician and sitting vice president.

The GOP presidential nominee is a twice-impeached, one-term president who was convicted of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in a case involving hush money paid to an adult film star. He has had multiple bankruptcies, faces hundreds of millions of dollars in fines from a civil fraud ruling and was found liable of sexual abuse. And he is revered by the Republican Party's evangelical base.

Do you want to know what’s weird to a majority of Americans who are just trying to live their lives? EVERYTHING IN THOSE PREVIOUS THREE PARAGRAPHS!

Joe Biden didn't bust out the 'weird' word, but he should have

For some reason, Biden’s campaign didn’t directly hit Trump with the W-word. But as soon as he stepped aside, Walz, the Harris campaign and other Democratic leaders wasted no time calling the former president what he is: weird.

Harris VP pick?Republicans, pay attention to who Harris picks for VP. One of them should scare us.

Trump never laughs. He’s rarely seen in public with his wife, Melania. He regularly says stuff like this from a recent rally: “We won in 2016. We did much better in 2020, but it was rigged. It was rigged.”

A lot of people throughout the Trump era have looked at his rallies or listened to him or one of his minions on TV and probably quietly said: “How in the heck is anyone taking these weirdos seriously?”

The word 'weird' fits. It works. It's concise and comfortingly spot on.

This is a smart labeling move by Harris and the Democrats. “Weird” captures an almost-exhausted emotion many of us have felt but failed to identify.

And it’s directed where it should be, at Trump's MAGA disciples and the elected Republicans who fall in line. It’s not a broad labeling of his supporters along the lines of Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables.” This isn’t punching down.

It’s cutting to the chase. It’s pointing at the bizarre characters and charlatans who willfully turned our politics toxic and sold ‒ and continue to sell ‒ snake oil and scapegoats to millions of Americans.

What Harris and Co. are rightfully saying to Trump and the Republican leaders in his sway is simple: “Enough. You all are really freakin’ weird.”","A person wearing a 'TRUMP' necklace and a red lanyard with 'RNC2024' on it, raising their hand.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA28881C0>,2024-07-29 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.usatoday.com,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/07/29/kamala-harris-calls-donald-trump-weird-tim-walz/74582201007/,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/39625e48e2.png
ffbf2c4d0b,National Review,The New York Times Doxxing Scandal Risks Its Institutional Credibility - National Review,"A note about a scandal at the New York Times, before my work turns into a weeklong journal of the Democratic National Convention’s visit to Chicago and you get to experience it through my pried-open eyes like Alex being taught a lesson by the powers that be in A Clockwork Orange. Last Thursday, the Wall Street Journal broke a stunning piece of media news when it reported on the actions of Natasha Frost, one of a number of recently acquired (in 2020) journalists the Times has brought on as its market share has expanded in inverse proportion to the rest of the mainstream media’s.

The detailed reporting of the Journal is well worth your time, but to summarize: Frost is currently living in Melbourne, Australia, but is not Australian. She describes herself as a citizen of the United Kingdom and Austria, and, beyond that, I know naught else about her background — even whether she is Jewish (I assume so). I don’t know the particulars of her assignment or work at the Times, either — listen, people, I’ve been brick-proofing my home, I have a better excuse than most — but the Journal’s story tells me all I need to know.

In the post–October 7 era, Frost was invited to a private WhatsApp support group for Australian Jewish “creatives” — professionals in a community whose politics are overwhelmingly anti-Zionist and often outright antisemitic. That definition was broad enough to encompass a New York Times reporter, apparently. (And she joined as an early member — one imagines somebody had to vouch for her, and that person must feel lower than a whale carcass right now.)

For a while, Frost hovered in the background as a member — no word is given about what, if anything, she may have contributed — until she abruptly left the group in mid January of this year. The reason? According to the WSJ, it was “to avoid, among other things, any perception that she would violate the privacy of its members,” because she was interested in writing about a subject many participants had expressed negative feelings about: local Australian woke cause célèbre Antoinette Lattouf.

A few days later, she published this rather milquetoast piece about Lattouf, a fiercely anti-Zionist Australian commentator and activist of Lebanese descent who was given a five-day temporary radio gig by state broadcaster ABC. There was then a massive uproar among the Australian Jewish community — this is a woman who has often accused Israel of state-sponsored genocide in Gaza — and her temporary gig was cut short a few days in. Now, Lattouf is suing for racial and political discrimination.

That’s the long and short of Frost’s piece, which honestly doesn’t really have too much of a slant beyond what one would expect of the Times and is only notable in highlighting how the editors who assign these pieces are forever on the hunt for examples of racial-discrimination porn to titillate their readers. My other opinion: It does a singularly unpersuasive job of making Lattouf into a sympathetic figure, no matter how much the author obviously tries. Lattouf hangs herself by her own words, at least a few of which Frost was professionally obligated to quote.

What is more notable about the piece is that it didn’t mention or reference the WhatsApp group — the “Jewish creatives” one — in any particular way whatsoever. This makes Frost’s exit from it a few days before the article went up curious in the extreme. The conflict is hard to see — unless she feared a conflict of opinion from others in the group about Lattouf as a fired broadcaster, which hardly rates. Disagreements are hardly unprecedented in the Jewish community, and again the piece wasn’t even particularly biased. Why leave the group? What could possibly have been the issue?

I think we know now. For it was later revealed that Frost gave the entire 900-page record of the WhatsApp group’s conversations — featuring many participants, all Jews, saying how unhappy they were about Lattouf — to Lattouf herself. It is terrifying to contemplate when this happened, but if my guess is correct, it was before she exited the group — and she lied to its admin about her reasons, rather cravenly. I suspect she didn’t want to stick around for what she knew was coming.

Because Lattouf did exactly what you would expect a frothing Australian antisemite to do: She promptly leaked it to pro-Hamas activists, effectively “doxxing” (publicly identifying) all the WhatsApp group’s members. And what happened next will also shock nobody in our morally reduced era: Pro-Hamas activists immediately began chasing store-owners out of town, stalking people with photographs of their children, and harassing schoolteachers at work by phoning them to say they were “complicit in genocide.”

Frost wants us to know that she’s sorry! (She was quoted by the WSJ saying “whoops” and adding that she’ll not talk any further about the matter.) You inevitably end up contemplating the personal details of a social betrayal like this: Has Lattouf even bothered to try to offer an excuse to Frost for utterly destroying her community? (It would be wonderful if she simply quoted Otter from Animal House, because that’s just about all she has to offer.) One also inevitably wonders whether Frost even wants an apology in the first place. How in God’s name could Frost have done this?

For I am trying to imagine the circumstances under which a New York Times journalist — someone trained to be responsible with confidential sources — could, with such lifelong training, hand over the unedited monthslong private correspondence of her community to someone she had just written a piece about. Given the obviously related subject matter — discussions about Lattouf — I at least find it difficult to imagine doing this without malice aforethought. I will be honest, I don’t know how any responsible journalist could; even someone unprofessionally crossing the line to say “Listen, people I know really are pushing to get you canned” could easily have given Lattouf blind quotes. (Someone who does that is still a viper in my opinion, but at least one with some constraint.) What you don’t do is send 900 unredacted pages of free-flowing private conversations to a known bad actor. That speaks either of bad faith or irresponsibility so staggering as to beggar belief. Either one demands instant firing.

And yet Frost remains employed at the New York Times, a scandal beyond reckoning that, in a different era, everyone would be ablaze over. Australia itself is completely losing its gourd over this, just so you know — it is not some minor news story. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese went on the air to publicly denounce it, and an anti-doxxing bill is being introduced into Parliament as soon as this month, according to the Journal. Since Australia lacks our more robust free-speech principles, the incident may well result in heavy-handed censorship, English-style. Congratulations on triggering a potential free-speech clampdown in Australia because of your reporter, New York Times! Finally — you’re a truly global brand.

In an ironic capstone guaranteed to sicken all of you, the New York Times has solicitously removed Frost’s contact information from its website. I know why: to spare her from the same sort of harassment she has inflicted, wittingly or otherwise, on the Australian Jewish community. I suppose workplace-safety issues and professional liability require it, if nothing else.","A man in a black jacket is walking past a building with a large, partially visible sign that reads 'The New York Times' and a Starbucks logo is visible in the background.",<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x131 at 0x7D6BA2F0A140>,2024-08-18 23:47:58+00:00,https://www.nationalreview.com,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-new-york-times-doxxing-scandal-risks-its-institutional-credibility/,['Politics' 'Opinion/Editorial'],[0.85 0.75],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/ffbf2c4d0b.png
5aec5791df,USA TODAY,How I used Citi ThankYou Points for an affordable Hawaiian vacation - USA TODAY,"Hawaii has a lot of things going for it, including unique food, music and culture, fantastic weather and gorgeous scenery. However, it isn’t very affordable. Yet thanks to Citi ThankYou® Points, I’m able to take my family on a Hawaiian vacation while paying nearly nothing for our airfare and lodging.

How I got a fantastic deal on airfare to Hawaii

The Citi Premier® Card * The information for the Citi Premier® Card has been collected independently by Blueprint. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer. offers points in the ThankYou Rewards program that can be transferred to any of Citi’s 14 airline loyalty partners. However, many of these airlines don’t even serve Hawaii, and others will charge an excessive number of points for award flights operated by their partners.

But one of Citi’s airline partners offers very low-priced awards to Hawaii, and it may be the one you would least expect.

Turkish Airlines allowed me to use miles to book award tickets on United between Denver and Hawaii for just 7,500 miles, per person, each way. That’s because the Turkish Airlines Miles & Smiles frequent flier programs considers Hawaii to be just another domestic destination, while nearly every other carrier charges additional miles for award flights to The Aloha State.

To put that price into perspective, United’s least expensive award flight to Hawaii is 25,000 miles, per person, each way. Despite the fact that Turkish recently announced that the prices for all of their frequent flier awards were going up, the new price is still just 10,000 miles per person, each way – 40% of United’s best price. In other words, transferring 100,000 Citi ThankYou Rewards points, you could fly your family of five to Hawaii, round-trip on Turkish Airlines partner United Airlines.

How to score free lodging in Hawaii using your Citi Points

When attempting to plan a Hawaiian vacation, you’ll quickly learn that getting there is sometimes the easy part. Fortunately, Wyndham Hotels is a transfer partner of the Citi ThankYou Rewards program. You might think of this program as the one that offers mostly budget properties such as the Days Inn, Super 8 and La Quinta brands, which are decidedly not part of your island vacation dreams. But if you dismiss the Wyndham Rewards loyalty program as just being good for budget motels, you’d be making a big mistake.

Wyndham Rewards points can also be redeemed for vacation rental properties managed by Vacasa and Extra Holidays. While it isn’t as widely known as AirBnB or VRBO, Vacasa manages over 44,000 vacation rentals in 35 states plus Canada, Mexico, Belize and Costa Rica. It has an extensive footprint in popular vacation destinations such as ski areas and beach resorts, like Hawaii.

Vacasa vacation rentals booked with Wyndham Rewards points cost 15,000 points per bedroom, per night. And if you’re a Wyndham Rewards Earner cardmember, you receive a 10% discount on all award redemptions. This includes the following cards:

Looking to fast-track your way to top-tier hotel benefits? Here’s the best credit cards for elite hotel status

For our family of five, we chose a 2-bedroom, 2-bath unit in Maui on the fifth floor overlooking the ocean. We were frequently delighted by the sight of whales breaching nearby. As a Wyndham Diamond member, our 10-day stay was 270,000 points. But best of all, Wyndham Rewards doesn’t impose any taxes, fees or cleaning charges on Vacasa award stays, so our total lodging bill was zero.

Better yet, we saved a tremendous amount of money by not staying in a hotel. Having a vacation rental with a kitchen allowed us to cook most of our meals ourselves. This might sound like work, but we enjoyed it. Because, if you haven’t been to a Hawaiian grocery store, you’re in for a treat as there is plenty of fresh fish and produce, as well as other local Hawaiian products that you won’t find on the mainland.

Staying in a vacation rental property also allowed us to pack light and do laundry in our room, eliminating the hassle and expense of traveling with large suitcases.

Tips for planning your own Hawaiian vacation

To find flights on United Airlines that are available as awards through partners such as Turkish Airlines, start by searching United’s website, but don’t log in. To find flights you can book through partners like Turkish, search for flights marked “Saver Award.” The flights that populate are the ones that you may be able to book with Turkish.

To be sure, the vast majority of United flights to Hawaii won’t be available with Turkish miles. But if you look far enough in advance, you’re sure to find some as we did.

Note that with United and most other airlines, award flights become bookable approximately 11 months before departure. After you’ve found Saver award flights on United.com, and confirmed that they are available on Turkish Airlines website, only then should you transfer your Citi ThankYou Rewards points to Turkish, which is an irreversible transaction.

To find and book Vacasa property with your Wyndham points, you need to search Vacasa.com and ExtraHolidays.com.

Regarding Vacasa properties, you should know that the Wyndham Rewards program will only let you redeem your points for units priced under $250 per bedroom, per night, including taxes and fees (until March 2024 it was $350 per bedroom). This isn’t an official policy written anywhere, but it appears to be a rule.

This will restrict the availability of one-bedroom units, as many cost more than 2350 a night. But if you have the points for a two-bedroom, it may be easier to find properties that fall below $500 per night. Once you’ve found a unit that appears to have correct pricing and availability online, call Wyndham’s dedicated phone line for Vacasa rentals at 800-441-1034 to confirm that you can book it with your Wyndham Rewards points.

If you’re told it’s available, you can instantly transfer your points online and reserve the room while you’re still on the phone with Vacasa reservations.

Bottom line

Once you visit our 50th state for the first time, you’ll understand why it’s such a popular vacation spot for Americans and the rest of the world. And if you know how to redeem your Citi ThankYou Rewards points for nearly free flights and hotels, you’ll be enjoying your Hawaiian vacation for far less than you might have imagined.","A serene beach scene with a clear blue sky, a calm sea, and a mountainous backdrop during sunset.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BCC0C6CE0>,2024-03-21 10:44:00+00:00,https://www.usatoday.com,https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/credit-cards/use-citi-thank-you-points-for-affordable-hawaiian-vacation/,['Business and Finance'],[0.9],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/5aec5791df.png

af74244175,Fox News,"Nancy Lieberman gets hot about Chennedy Carter: ‘If I were Caitlin Clark, I would’ve punched her in the face’ - Fox News","Nancy Lieberman, the former WNBA player and coach, weighed in on the Caitlin Clark-Chennedy Carter confrontation from the weekend.

Carter’s hip-check on Clark, which the league upgraded to a flagrant foul after Saturday night’s game between the Chicago Sky and Indiana Fever, has led to heavy debate in the sports world.

The panel on FanDuel’s ""Run It Back"" asked Lieberman what she would’ve done in that situation, and her answer was about as blunt as it gets.

""If I were Caitlin Clark, I would’ve punched her in the face,"" Lieberman said. ""I’m from New York, and I would’ve told her to f--- off. That would actually cure the problem.""

Lieberman is one of the most respected former players and coaches in women’s basketball, so her opinion on what should’ve gone down carries some weight.

She likened Clark to NBA superstar LeBron James, saying ""[Clark] doesn’t want to mix it up with people, although she could"" to protect her image. The Fever also have to be worried about keeping her on the court. A physical altercation usually results in an ejection and suspension.

CHENNEDY CARTER SAYS SHE HAS ‘NO REGRETS FOR FOUL ON CAITLIN CLARK: ’I'M GOING TO COMPETE'

Lieberman also pointed a finger at the Fever’s reaction when the foul occurred.

""I’ve known Chennedy since she was in high school here in Dallas. She’s a tough kid. She’s a really good basketball player,"" Lieberman said. ""She’s going to come after you because she’s really physical, which is OK. But, damn, where’s Caitlin Clark’s teammates? I’d be p---ed as s--- at my teammates if nobody came to my defense.

""Gretzky had an enforcer. Michael Jordan had Oakley. Honestly, it’s just bulls---. This has to be better. Indiana has to be better.""

Lieberman knows Clark is a ""generational talent,"" and through just a few games, Clark has become one of the hottest topics in sports.

Lieberman compared Clark to James, but she also mentioned the financial benefits the WNBA will see, like Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods did for their respective leagues.

""People need to thank Caitlin Clark for being that generational athlete that is making them wealthy,"" Lieberman explained. ""They will have generational wealth. They will not have chartered jets without her. They wouldn’t have been on TV. I know the W has worked hard over the last 27, 28 years. But they weren’t doing this with all the greats, the Hall of Famers — Lisa [Leslie], [Diana] Taurasi, [Sue] Bird. It was still sporadic with some of the greatest players in the game.

""Caitlin has caught the interest of the common person, both women, men, children. We need to celebrate her, not tolerate her. She’s a great kid.""

Carter spoke to the media for the first time about her foul on Clark, saying she has ""no regrets"" for what happened, and she will always play hard no matter the opponent. Her teammate, Angel Reese, also noted that she and the Sky are fine being villains if that’s how fans portray them.

4d0b91a376,CNN,Opinion: The most aggressive restructuring of government in almost 90 years - CNN,"Editor’s Note: Steve Vladeck is a CNN legal analyst and a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. He is the author of the “One First” Supreme Court newsletter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.

It is entirely fitting that the last decision the Supreme Court handed down from the bench during its October 2023 term was the 6-3, ideologically divided ruling in the Trump immunity case. Love it or hate it, what cannot be denied about Chief Justice Roberts’s majority opinion is that it transfers a massive amount of power to the institution of the presidency — and in the same instance, to the courts, who will be left to enforce the constitutionally significant, but ambiguous, lines between “core” presidential powers, “official acts” and “unofficial acts.”

In that respect, among others, this opinion is emblematic of the broader theme reflected across the body of the court’s work over the last nine months — the most aggressive restructuring of the federal government in our lifetimes. Across most of the court’s highest-profile rulings (and a bunch of lower-profile ones), the justices took a massive amount of power away from Congress and executive branch agencies, and gave it, instead, to the courts.

That may lead to satisfying results in the short-term depending upon which prospective president you support, but in the long term, all it guarantees is increasing instability in our legal system — and a resulting risk to the health of our democratic republic.

Perhaps the easiest place to visualize this shift is in the ability of executive branch agencies to regulate everything from the safety of the food we eat to the amount of pollutants power plants are allowed to emit.

Friday’s ruling in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, in which a 6-3 majority (also ideologically divided) overruled the court’s 1984 Chevron decision, means that, when an agency adopts a reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute it is tasked with enforcing, courts should still override that reading if they disagree. (Justice Jackson recused in Loper Bright itself, but participated in — and dissented from — the Court’s ruling in the consolidated Relentless case.)

In Chevron itself, the question was whether a group of industrial plants huddled next to each other are each a “major stationary source of pollution,” or, rather, one combined source. The theory animating the Supreme Court’s (unanimous) decision in Chevron was that trained scientists and public policy experts at the Environmental Protection Agency are likely to have a better answer to that question than unelected judges — and, more importantly, that Congress is allowed to prefer their interpretation to the courts’. After Loper Bright, that understanding is no more.

Loper Bright’s impact is only compounded by Monday’s ruling in Corner Post, Inc. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, in which the same ideologically divided, 6-3 majority held that litigants can challenge decades-old action by administrative agencies so long as that action has recently injured them. In other words, even if a company lost a challenge to a regulation 30 years ago, it can form a new subsidiary and have that company challenge the rule under the new, no-deference regime.

Those challenges may well fail, but the upshot is that litigants will find the most ideologically sympathetic judges in the country to whom those challenges will be steered, and it will be up to the courts, and not the agencies, to decide which rules and regulations make the most sense. To take just one example, consider the court’s 5-4 ruling last week in Ohio v. EPA, in which Justice Neil Gorsuch’s majority opinion repeatedly second-guessed how the EPA had conducted its internal processes in promulgating a nationwide rule regulating ozone pollution — in an opinion that regularly referred to “nitrous oxide” (laughing gas), not the more environmentally damaging category of nitrogen oxides. We don’t expect judges to be scientists, but we also don’t want them to be.

This kind of government by judicial decree is something we haven’t seen in generations — since the much-maligned “Lochner era,” named after a 1905 Supreme Court decision that paved the way to decades of courts substituting their judgment for that of legislatures when it came to ordinary economic regulation. The courts’ judgment wasn’t always bad, but it was far less accountable to the public than the democratically elected branches — which, among other things, made it much harder for states and the federal government to aggressively respond to the Great Depression. It was only at the end of the court’s October 1936 term, in March and April of 1937, that the justices changed course — ushering in a new era of deference to democratically elected governmental actors that helped to cement the New Deal.

The administrative law cases are just the tip of the iceberg. Consider the two major cases involving former President Donald Trump — both the immunity ruling and the Colorado ballot disqualification decision from back in March. In that latter case, the high court also took power away from part of the government — holding that states lack the power not only to disqualify from presidential ballots those determined to have engaged in insurrection, but from congressional ballots, as well.

And even where Congress has spoken, the court this term regularly decided that the underlying statutes didn’t mean what their plain text said. Thus, the federal government can’t regulate “bump stocks” under its authority to regulate machine guns. January 6 rioters can’t be prosecuted for obstructing the Joint Session of Congress under a statute that sure seems to say otherwise. And it’s not bribery for public officials to accept “gratuities” in exchange for official acts so long as those acts came first.

The upshot of all of these rulings, and others, is to give ever more power to courts — to decide which actions by the executive branch are permissible, what Congress really meant even when the statutory text seems plain and when former presidents can be tried for attempting to subvert the very core of our democracy. In that sense, the work of the Supreme Court this term only amplifies the stakes of the November presidential election — not just because of who will control the executive branch come January 2025, but because of who will get to appoint the next generation of judges to whom all of this power has now been entrusted.

We can hope that those judges will exercise that power prudently and responsibly. But given how much more difficult it is to hold judges accountable than Congress or the President, we may be left only to hope. That might be a satisfactory result in the short term, but it has ominous long-term consequences for what it means to live in a democracy.","The Supreme Court building is shown with a dramatic sky above, possibly indicating a serious or significant event.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA4FE4FD0>,2024-07-02 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/02/opinions/supreme-court-radically-restructures-government-vladeck/index.html,['Opinion/Editorial'],[0.95],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/4d0b91a376.png
44e8d7af1e,USA TODAY,I need the liberal Supreme Court justices to stop overreacting in their dissents - USA TODAY,"The Supreme Court has sided with President Donald Trump in his presidential immunity case. Monday's decision itself was incredibly tame, typical for those authored by Chief Justice John Roberts.

However, the response from the liberal justices was anything but.

“The nature of Presidential power entitles a former President to absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority,” Roberts wrote for the majority. “And he is entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts. There is no immunity for unofficial acts.”

This means that Trump cannot be prosecuted for his discussions with Justice Department officials about investigating purported election fraud following the 2020 election. Other examples highlighted during oral arguments in April were President Barack Obama potentially being ""charged with murder for killing U.S. citizens abroad by drone strike,"" as well as President George W. Bush ""for obstructing an official proceeding or allegedly lying to Congress to induce war in Iraq.""

Without such immunity, Roberts wrote, “the President would be chilled from taking the ‘bold and unhesitating action’ required of an independent Executive.”

While Trump called the decision a “big win” in a Truth Social post, the chief justice clarified that “Trump asserts a far broader immunity than the limited one the Court recognizes.”

What the decision does not provide Trump immunity from is “unofficial acts,” those not required in order to execute his role as president or not covered by the powers afforded to the chief executive. According to certain legal experts, this would include Trump’s recent felony indictment concerning falsified business records in the lead-up to the 2016 election.

Liberal justices' overreaction misrepresents the Supreme Court decision

As is a now common theme with the court, the liberal justices have cast this decision as another doomsday event for our country.

“The President of the United States is the most powerful person in the country, and possibly the world,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in dissent. “When he uses his official powers in any way, under the majority’s reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution. Orders the Navy’s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune.”

Even if Sotomayor's reading were to be accurate, impeachment remains the vehicle through which we hold our leaders in check.

While Roberts specifies that impeachment and removal from office are not always required for criminal prosecution of a former president, it is how egregious actions can still be handled. As a result of this decision, impeachment becomes the simplest, though not the only, way to hold the president accountable.

Congress is still useless:Have you realized the Supreme Court is the only part of our government doing its job?

Our elected officials crave power, and the thought of losing that power is as motivating as the potential of prison time (or, in the case of Trump, seemingly more so). To pretend as if our country has lost any means of holding our elected officials accountable is entirely disingenuous, and this is not the DEFCON 1 emergency that the left has made it out to be.

Believe me, in light of a president who is proven to be willing to break the law and frequently teetered on doing so, I understand the concerns. But the dynamic of another Trump presidency does not change whatsoever. If Trump makes it back to the White House, the process for him being removed from office was the same as it always was: impeachment.

With fear for our democracy, I beg the courts’ left-wing justices to stop feeding the fire of America's Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, only 24% of whom have a favorable view of the Supreme Court. The disingenuous musings from the court's liberal minority aren't helping to establish trust.

By writing these ludicrous and out-of-touch dissents, they are only further politicizing the very institution they remain a part of, accelerating our country’s decline from a position tasked with preserving stability.

While conservative justices often write hard-lined, combative opinions as well, rarely do they catastrophize the opposing outcome quite like the liberal wing does. Part of that is a symptom of being in the majority more commonly, yet even when writing in dissent, the conservative justices make it a point to debate the law rather than overreacting for social media attention.

The Supreme Court cannot save us from ourselves

I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention the insanity surrounding the fact that we are nominating presidential candidates who have forced the Supreme Court to answer such questions.

The deterioration of the executive branch into a race to the bottom once again rears its ugly head in the judiciary, a theme we should be prepared for to continue into the future.

The SCOTUS decision you should know:You probably missed this Supreme Court decision. It will change how government works.

Forcing the Supreme Court to decide on such balances between a country where retribution malicious prosecution between political opponents is commonplace or one in which the chief executive enjoys immunity. The American people should heed the warnings outlined by both sides of this opinion and simply elect better leaders.

The Supreme Court does not have the job of ensuring that our leaders are the best of the best; it has the job of determining what the law says.

The responsibility to ensure we are not ruled by tyrants does not lie in anybody's hands besides the American people. We have nobody to blame but ourselves for the choice between two unfit leaders we now face, and regardless of who you think is right in this Supreme Court case, that should be your real takeaway.

fce6e394d5,CBC News,"Canadian media a target for foreign interference, says national security committee chair - CBC News","Foreign actors are trying to interfere with the Canadian news media and journalists and their bosses need to be aware of it, the chair of Parliament's nonpartisan national security committee warned on Wednesday.

All forms of media, including mainstream media, are being subjected to interference by bad actors, Liberal MP David McGuinty said.

He said he can't divulge specifics because the information is classified.

The media was singled out in a recent report by the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP), which McGuinty chairs.

The document says China and India are interfering with Canadian media content through direct engagement with journalists and media executives.

""Foreign interference is definitely in the media, and it is singled out in the review, not only in our most immediate review but in our past review,"" McGuinty told reporters Wednesday.

""You should read it and take it to your owners and editors.""

The latest report said there are examples of China paying to publish media articles without attribution, sponsoring media travel to China, pressuring journalists to withdraw articles and creating false accounts on social media to spread disinformation.

Different Chinese-language media outlets in Canada were found to have adopted the language of a People's Republic of China state media article without attributing it, the report alleges.

""Most of these media outlets were linked to the PRC via partnership agreements with the China News Service, the Chinese Communist Party's primary media entity servicing Chinese ethnocultural communities, which reports directly to the United Front Work Department, the Chinese Communist Party's central co-ordinating body for foreign interference activities,"" the report says.

And it found India demonstrated the intent and capability to engage in foreign interference by manipulating the media, saying an example of this was India's effort to discredit a political party leader ""using materials drafted by Indian intelligence organizations.""

The intelligence community also observed states manipulating traditional media to spread propaganda in what otherwise appeared to be independent news publications, the report says, without specifying which countries were involved.

The redacted report is based on secret intelligence, which often doesn't paint a full picture and does not equate to evidence.

Green Party Leader Elizabeth May read the unredacted report and relayed some of her findings to media on Tuesday.

She is not bound by the same Security of Information Act that McGuinty and other members of the committee are subject to, which requires them to keep quiet about their work.

The report does not specify which media organizations, at any level, are being targeted, May said.

But she said it shows journalists are among those being infiltrated and co-opted by foreign interference.

""We need to protect our democracy by better understanding what hostile foreign governments see as their targets,"" May said.

""And it's basically a lot more aspects of our society than I would have imagined, including journalists.""

The medium- and long-term goal of foreign states is to reduce the public's trust in democratic institutions, increase polarization and lower trust in the media while promoting their strategic foreign interests, security officials have told parliamentarians.

A 2023 study by Statistics Canada shows only 58 per cent of Canadians who say they have a high level of confidence in four or more institutions trusted news and information from the media.

That level of trust dropped to 15 per cent among those who reported low confidence in institutions, the report said.","A group of people, one in a suit, are gathered indoors, with a focus on a person holding a smartphone, possibly in a discussion or interview setting.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BDA7916C0>,2024-06-12 18:29:00+00:00,https://www.cbc.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadian-media-foreign-interference-1.7232735,['National' 'Politics' 'International'],[0.9  0.85 0.8 ],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/fce6e394d5.png
41102e003a,CNN,Some Jewish Democrats wonder if America is ready for a Jewish vice president - CNN,"Josh Shapiro’s advisers debated the early seconds of his first ad of the 2022 Pennsylvania governor’s campaign: He was going to start by saying that he makes sure to be home every Friday night for dinner with his family. But should his script call it “Sabbath dinner”? Should the shot of the table show a challah bread?

After all, the last time a guy named Shapiro had been elected governor of Pennsylvania, he had years earlier anglicized his name to Shapp.

The answers were yes and yes. Shapiro’s wife Lori even baked the braided loaves herself.

Now, with Shapiro very much in contention in Kamala Harris’ rushed running mate search, the Democratic world – already divided over the politics of Israel in the wake of the October 7 Hamas attack – is wondering whether the US would really be ready for a Jewish vice president — and the first Black and South Asian woman president, who happens to be married to a Jewish man.

While there is another Jewish governor, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, who has also already been through two rounds of vetting interviews with Harris’ staff, it’s the Pennsylvania governor – with his outspoken views on Judaism and Israel – who has been the focus as Harris aides are looking at who would help the ticket. Shapiro’s home battleground state isn’t the only factor; the conversation is also about his potential wider appeal in the “Blue Wall” states, about how Jewish populations are bigger than the 2020 margins of victory in many battlegrounds, and how his selection would play with the Arab American population in Michigan and progressives overall.

Some pro-Palestinian organizers, amplified by groups like the Democratic Socialists of America and the Sunrise Movement, have been taken to calling him “Genocide Josh” on social media — even though the governor has never cast a vote on any foreign policy issue and the statements he has made about Israel have been more pointed than other prospects, but not substantively different.

“I’m not aware of how his position on Israel differs from the other potential vice presidents,” Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, who is both Jewish and a proud progressive, told CNN.

Among even many Jewish Democrats who are Shapiro fans, excitement about the prospect of his being the pick is mixed with pride, anxiety and fear of what sort of divisions and conspiracy theories his selection could set off.

“Is the antisemitism going to increase because now you’d have the person who sleeps next to her and the person who would be her closest political ally are both Jewish?” asked one Jewish former Democratic statewide leader outside of Pennsylvania who is a Shapiro fan. “Does it make it more dangerous for those of us in the Jewish community?”

Rep. Greg Landsman – an Ohio congressman whose tattoos include a passage from the Book of Micah in Hebrew on his left shoulder – said it’s a real question of whether America would be ready for a Jewish vice president, or at least a Jewish running mate.

“Some folks would be, others no,” Landsman told CNN. “There is a lot of Jew hate out there. I’ve experienced it. We all have. And there are folks on the far right that have made it worse, and folks on the far left that have made it worse. But that’s true for most issues.”

Nevada Sen. Jacky Rosen, who was the president of a synagogue in the Las Vegas suburbs before getting into politics, said she’d be “thrilled” if Shapiro were the choice.

“It’s really great to have representation and to have someone who understands what it means to work to fight antisemitism and all forms of hate, what it means to do a lot of these things,” she said.

Simone Zimmerman – a co-founder of the group IfNotNow, made up of Jews opposed to the Israeli offensive in Gaza and American support for the Israeli government – said Shapiro would be a problem with the party base because he has “significantly more divisive positions on one important issue that a lot of us care about in a way that is disqualifying.”

“Chalking all of this up to antisemitism,” Zimmerman said, “is once again a way to distract from an honest conversation about his agenda.”

Others argue that the risk of dividing the party is too high.

“The party is incredibly united at this moment. Of the VP’s choices, Shapiro is the one who stands out as the most divisive and could put a stop in everyone being on the same page,” said one Jewish Democratic operative. “We have to be realistic. We have to understand the stakes and what it takes to win and that’s going to require a lot of Democratic energy.”

Shapiro has set a record for getting more votes than any other Democrat in Pennsylvania in each of his races, although he faced weak GOP opponents. Along the way, he earned support from Black ministers who have talked about connecting to him through faith, Catholics who trusted him when he took on the church in a massive abuse scandal he investigated and prosecuted while state attorney general, and just this week a Muslim leader wrote an op-ed in the Philadelphia Inquirer about how the governor for years has “had our back.”

But Shapiro is a different kind of Jewish politician than many who have come before. He’s not an Orthodox Jew like the late Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman — whose stringent adherence was so infamous that his friend, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, even made a joke about it at his memorial service in Washington last week. Shapiro is nonetheless more observant than many in public life and more apt to talk about it. There have been more than two dozen Jewish governors in the US, but he’s the first to perform the ceremony making the kitchen in the governor’s mansion kosher, and nearly every speech he gives includes a riff on a famous Jewish teaching that “no one is required to complete the task, but neither are we free to refrain from it.”

His aides and advisers argue that rather than a liability, Shapiro’s faith has been a way of making connections, of building trust. They say polling can’t empirically measure the impact, but argue it demonstrates his authenticity and helps explain his high popularity in a big and diverse state with a very small Jewish population.

“He’s been pretty powerfully talking about his faith in a way that doesn’t just appeal to Jews, but folks across a pretty wide swath who are religious and not religious,” said one Jewish Democratic operative who has worked with Shapiro. “It is a part of how he’s been able to earn such significant support across different parts of the electorate.”

But that was all running on his own, not as the potential addition to a ticket going up against a Republican nominee who this week agreed with a radio host that second gentleman Doug Emhoff is “a crappy Jew,” said that Harris herself “doesn’t like Jewish people” or that Jews who vote for Democrats “should have their head examined.”

Ed Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor who is Jewish but was never affiliated or observant, recalled a time in his first campaign, for Philadelphia district attorney in 1977, when he was introduced to a local political leader as running against “some Yid.” Rendell said then that he had been so shocked and so cowed that he didn’t even point out the slur technically applied to him as well.

Rendell said he believes things have changed in the last 45 years.

“There were a lot of people who don’t like Jews who voted for Josh Shapiro because they said he’s different,” Rendell said.

Activist Jewish roots all the way back to his bar mitzvah

Shapiro has been keeping a low profile through the vetting process and declined through a spokesperson to be interviewed. But speaking to CNN on his campaign bus riding through western Pennsylvania in late October 2022, days before being elected governor, Shapiro said he was eager for people to know about his connection to Judaism.

“That is what motivates me. It really is. I think if you want to be someone’s governor, they’ve got to know who you are as a person, what motivates you,” Shapiro told CNN. “That’s why I always talk about it. I talk about my faith because I want people to know what calls me to service.”

Shapiro brushed aside questions about how his Republican opponent in that race attacked him for going to a Jewish day school, trafficked in antisemitic tropes and faced criticism for his ties to a website known for its antisemitic content.

“I’m not going to let him or his attacks on my faith dictate how I practice my faith or how I speak. But I will say his attacks, this might surprise you, don’t bother me personally,” Shapiro said at the time. “They really don’t. What bothers me is the way he shows others that he’s disrespecting them by virtue of how he attacks my faith.”

Long before Shapiro started plotting his political career, he and his father traveled to a variety of Jewish communities to raise awareness about the “refuseniks,” or Soviet Jews who felt oppressed but were being stopped from emigrating to Israel or the United States. He formed a group called Children for Avi, named after his pen pal, of 50 kids across the country writing letters protesting the situation. An article in the local paper in 1986 about Shapiro’s bar mitzvah includes a photo of the rabbi blessing the 13-year-old future governor and the Soviet boy, who was able to attend because Sen. Ted Kennedy appealed to Mikhail Gorbachev to get the family out of the country after 14 years of their trying.

That sensibility carried through Shapiro’s political career including in June, when he and Emhoff were among the featured speakers at a groundbreaking for the new Tree of Life synagogue outside of Pittsburgh to replace the building where, in 2018, an antisemite with an assault rifle killed 11 and wounded six others at Saturday morning services.

Shapiro used the Hebrew phrase referring to the connection between generations and the Yiddish word for praying. He spoke about seeing the bullet holes when he toured the sanctuary with his children.

“Remembrance cannot be a passive act,” he said, and later decried that at this moment, “Some leaders at times offer permission slips to hate.”

With these roots, several people who have known Shapiro for years say it’s no surprise that he has stood up strongly in support of Israel and called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “one of the worst leaders of all time,” but that when he saw some protests on campuses tipping into antisemitism, he felt the need to speak out.

Pushing back on some advisers who urged him to hold back, Shapiro said he was listening to the tone of some of the protests and believed that that the atmosphere was getting dangerous.

After joining the criticism of the university presidents who struggled to condemn antisemitism during congressional hearings last fall, Shapiro said universities were failing in their obligation to keep students safe. He said that people who had moved into antisemitic chants and behavior were being excused and that there would be no tolerance for people “dressed up in KKK outfits or KKK regalia,” outraging some pro-Palestinian activists with the comparison.

Shapiro’s popularity stayed high in Pennsylvania throughout. But some of the loudest voices on the left, perhaps most prominently the Democratic Socialists of America and related groups, are now pointing to that rhetoric to argue he should be disqualified from Harris’ consideration. And some are using that to claim Shapiro is not actually a progressive, pointing to issues like his support for school vouchers or suggesting that he was too pro-police as attorney general.

Criticizing Shapiro about policy disagreements is fair, said Jewish Council for Public Affairs CEO Amy Spitalnick, but “when you are running a campaign around ‘Genocide Josh’ and he is the only potential candidate being labeled as such, that is singling out the Jewish candidate.”

“I think it’s clear why. You’d be hard pressed to find any Jewish member of Congress that hasn’t on occasion faced a similar double standard,” said Adam Schiff, the California congressman and Senate candidate. “It’s offensive and wrong and I regret that Governor Shapiro has to endure this.”

Even a “Case for Tim Walz for Vice President” document circulated by supporters – which a spokesman said is not connected to the Minnesota governor – makes an implicit reference to Shapiro’s perceived liability, arguing, “He has no known personal skeletons, major drawbacks or divisive stances that might depress Democratic base enthusiasm (eg. Israel/Gaza policy, charter schools, etc.)”

Several Jewish Democratic operatives confided privately to CNN that though they think the attacks on Shapiro may be unfair and have at least tinges of antisemitism, they are anxious about him being the pick because of what putting him on the ticket could set off, from renewed protests at the Democratic convention later this month to larger splits in the party.

But calling what’s coming at Shapiro “pure antisemitism,” Rep. Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat, warned against that defensive way of thinking.

“I strongly disagree with the notion that because bad actors would act badly that we should therefore avoid the possibility of those bad actors acting badly. That way lies madness,” Goldman said. “That’s how extortion happens — where the victims avoid what would be a confrontation with the bullies.”

You can also read about Labour Party leader Keir Starmer’s comments regarding Israel’s war on Gaza and how his electoral victory may impact the UK’s stance on the conflict, here.

And for all of our coverage of the Gaza conflict, click here.

The Israeli army said that it had struck “several terrorists” in central Gaza who it claims were using a school in the Nuseirat area as “cover”.

“A short while ago, based on intelligence and using precise munition, the IAF struck several terrorists who were conducting terrorist activities, using the structures of a school in the area of Nuseirat as cover,” the army said in a statement, referring to the Israeli Air Force.

A source at the al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat told the AFP news agency that it had received several wounded people for treatment after an attack on a school run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.

Israeli forces have shot a man in the occupied West Bank city of Qalqilya, the Wafa news agency reports.

The Palestinian man, who was shot in the thigh, has been taken to a hospital in Jenin for treatment, according to Wafa.

Israeli troops, accompanied by a large number of vehicles, bulldozers and reconnaissance aircraft, have also stormed the city of Tulkarem, while fighting has been reported between Israeli forces and Palestinians in the village of Husan, west of Bethlehem.

The UN says at least 17,000 Palestinian children in Gaza have been orphaned or separated from their parents, with many now being looked after by relatives.

One grandmother, mourning the loss of her daughter, recounts how she took her granddaughter to her mother’s grave. The child, who was found to have skull and facial fractures, constantly asks about her deceased family, who were all killed in a bombing.

Another woman who evacuated to search for her husband, only to be killed by the Israeli army, has left behind four boys and a girl. Her sister, who cares for the children, describes their struggle for food and support.

Al Jazeera’s Bisan Owda reports from Gaza:

Israeli settlers have attacked vehicles belonging to Palestinians in a town south of Nablus in the occupied West Bank, the Wafa news agency reported.

A group of settlers threw stones towards the vehicles in the town of Huwara, it said. No injuries were reported.

Settler attacks against Palestinians and their property have increased in scale and intensity since October 7. More than 1,000 settler attacks have been reported since, according to UN figures.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says that the al-Ahli Arab Hospital and the Patient’s Friends Benevolent Society Hospital in Gaza City are now out of service.

“Patients either self-evacuated, were given early discharge or referred to Kamal Adwan and Indonesian hospitals, which are suffering shortage[s] of fuel, beds and trauma medical supplies,” Tedros said in a post on X.

He said reports on new evacuation orders in Gaza City will further impede the delivery of “very limited life-saving care”.

Other health facilities in the area remain functional but could “quickly become non-functional due to hostilities in their vicinity or obstruction to access”, he warned.

France’s Foreign Ministry condemned Israel’s recent decision to expand illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank.

The ministry particularly condemned, in an official statement, “the official recognition of five new settlements and the approval of plans to build 5,000 extra residential units in several settlements in the West Bank, as well as the seizure of 1,200 hectares [2,965 acres]” in the Jordan Valley.

The Israeli government’s decisions are “of a deep gravity due to their scales and their consequences on peace and stability in the West Bank and the region”, the ministry added.

New York University has settled a lawsuit by Jewish students who accused the school of failing to stop anti-Semitism on campus, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan federal court has said.

The terms of the settlement were not immediately available and NYU, its lawyers and the students’ lawyers did not immediately respond to requests by the Reuters news agency for comment.

The settlement was announced the same day Brown University agreed to bolster nondiscrimination training for employees and students to resolve a complaint filed with the US Department of Education over its handling of discrimination and harassment claims, including those related to anti-Semitism.

NYU was sued last November, in one of the earliest of the now-many lawsuits accusing major universities of allowing anti-Semitism following October 7.

In seeking a dismissal, NYU argued that reports of anti-Semitism had declined significantly following an initial surge immediately after Israel’s assault on Gaza began. It also said it had taken far more steps than the law required to address student concerns, including adopting a “10 Point Plan” to boost on-campus security and disciplining people who violate its anti-discrimination policies.

The Red Sea and Gulf of Aden Joint Maritime Information Center (JMIC) has confirmed that the Palau-flagged cargo vessel Verbena, which was attacked by Yemen’s Houthis on June 13, has been towed away from its threat area and is en route to its next port of call.

At the time, we reported that the Verbena was hit by missiles while it was transiting the Gulf of Aden. The Houthis later claimed responsibility for the attack.

As a result, the cargo vessel caught fire and the crew was unable to contain it. The vessel had taken on water after the crew was rescued and transported to safety, the US Central Command said, adding that one crew member was injured in the attack.

The Houthis have launched dozens of attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea since November, in what they say is in solidarity with Palestinians.","A donkey pulls a cart with several people, including children, through a street with buildings and debris in the background.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x168 at 0x7D6BA2A28A30>,2024-07-08 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2024/7/8/israel-war-on-gaza-live-israel-orders-palestinians-to-flee-west-gaza-city,['International' 'Politics' 'Health'],[0.9  0.85 0.7 ],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/a627157697.png
42fe238b0f,The Guardian,Centrist Tories urge Andy Street to stand for parliament – and maybe one day for leader - The Guardian,"Senior Tories on the moderate One Nation wing of the party are urging the defeated West Midlands mayor Andy Street to consider reviving his political career by standing for a seat at Westminster.

Street suffered the biggest shock of the local and mayoral elections a week ago when he lost to Labour’s Richard Parker by just 1,508 votes in a knife-edge contest.

The narrow defeat deprived the former head of John Lewis of a third term in charge of the second largest mayoral region in England. Street suggested he would take some time before deciding on his next move.

But Damian Green, chair of the One Nation group of Tory MPs at Westminster, made clear he believed Street would be a great addition to the parliamentary party.

“I would very much welcome Andy staying in active politics, as an MP if he wants, as he is a huge asset to the Conservatives and has a track record that any Conservative would be proud of,” Green said.

Other Tories on the left and centre of the party believe he could even mount a challenge for the leadership were the party to lose heavily at the general election and prime minister Rishi Sunak were to stand down.

Another senior Tory said: “Andy has not spent time in government, but he has run a big city and a large business. He knows how to run things and he knows about politics. He has a great track record. I can see him emerging as a very credible candidate for a position not just as an MP but as one at the top of our party.”

With a general election approaching, the Conservative party will be looking for candidates in several seats in the West Midlands, where Street will already have very high voter recognition. One vacancy will be in Solihull West and Shirley (which the Tories held with a majority of more than 21,000 in 2019). Solihull was one of the seven council districts voting in the mayoral election and where Street won by a large margin.

In his resignation speech, which was generous to the victor and gracious in tone, Street thanked his team and said he was sorry that he had not been able to win a third term. He appeared to hint that he might stand for the mayoralty again in four years’ time, telling his supporters and allies he was sure they would fight to live another day.

During his campaign he went out of his way to dissociate himself from Sunak and the Conservative party, describing his offer as “brand Andy”.

Tory MPs fully understood why he had to do this to have a chance of retaining the mayoralty.

The Spectator magazine last week praised his dignity in defeat and wondered whether one day Street could rise to the very top of the party.

“It was a classy performance, one which will have sharpened the sadness many Conservatives already felt at his loss,” the magazine said. “Street balanced acceptance with an honest admission of acute disappointment, and that collection of emotions felt real and unfiltered. After a grim few days for the party, and with the memory of Susan Hall’s less gracious concession speech in London still fresh in the mind, some have now wondered if Street should now look to a future at Westminster. Perhaps, one theory goes, he might even be a contender for the Conservative leadership in the wake of an election defeat.”

The West Midlands result last Saturday evening capped a disastrous showing for the Tories in the local council mayoral and police commissioner elections. They finished third behind the Liberal Democrats in the number of seats held, for the first time since 1996.","A man in a suit and tie walks with two children on a sidewalk, with a wooden structure and cars in the background, under the headline 'The Observer'.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BA22EF5B0>,2024-05-12 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/may/12/tories-andy-street-parliament-leader-west-midlands-mayor-conservative-party,['Politics' 'National'],[0.9 0.7],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/42fe238b0f.png
6d5dbd35ec,The New York Times,Your Partner Is Ignoring a Health Issue. Now What? - The New York Times,"When I received a notice from my doctor to schedule my first colonoscopy, I put it off for nearly two years. I didn’t relish the idea of bowel prep, and I was nervous the procedure would hurt.

As the months rolled on, my husband pleaded with me to make the appointment. I ignored him, so, in desperation, he enlisted my no-nonsense mother.

“Hey there!” she hollered at me over the phone. “You know what’s worse than drinking laxatives for a day? Cancer!”

Many experts — both psychologists and primary care physicians — told me that they see this a lot with couples: One partner refuses or delays dealing with a health problem, and it makes the other frustrated and resentful.

Those neglecting their health can feel judged as “lazy or careless or indulgent or risky,” said Alexandra Solomon, a clinical psychologist at the Family Institute at Northwestern University.

Meanwhile, the other person can come off as, “I’m sitting over here with my apples and my bananas and my annual mammogram,” she explained. “It’s you that’s the hot mess.”

She and other experts shared advice for how to meet in the middle.

Collaborate rather than confront.

If you’re the person urging the other to get checked out, said Dr. Solomon, start the conversation by reminding your partner of your affection. Then calmly share how the avoidance makes you feel.

Dr. Solomon suggested the following script: “I want you around for as many years as possible. I love the things we’re able to do together right now. And the idea of no longer being able to do those things scares me and makes me sad.”

Own your part in the back-and-forth, she added. If you’re anxious, for example, you could say something like “‘I need to figure out how to manage my anxiety, because it tends to come out as complaining, cajoling, giving you printouts or guilt-tripping you,’” Dr. Solomon said.

A 2020 study of couples who wanted their partners to make health-related changes — such as quitting smoking and starting to exercising — found that using pressure and guilt wasn’t effective in changing behavior, but offering support and encouragement was.

Being candid about your worries can disarm your reluctant partner, Dr. Solomon said, and allow for a more connected conversation.

Then, ask about any health anxieties, and listen with an open mind, said Dr. Steven Starks, a geriatric psychiatrist and clinical assistant professor at the University of Houston’s Tilman J. Fertitta Family College of Medicine.

There may be many reasons your partner would rather avoid tests and screenings, he said, like fear of getting bad news or a history of feeling dismissed by doctors.

Get your partner talking as much as possible, added Dr. Starks. He mentioned a patient whose spouse had a medical condition that was seemingly treatable, but required a procedure. The spouse decided against it and died within the year, he said, leaving the patient both grief-stricken over the loss and angry that it might’ve been avoided.

Offer concrete ways to help.

List specific ways that you will show up for your partner and make things as easy as possible, like offering to schedule the doctor’s appointment and tag along for the visit. Volunteer to be the note taker or the question asker, Dr. Solomon said, “or tell them ‘I can take you out to lunch after.’”

If you’re urging your partner to have a healthier lifestyle, find ways to actively support those changes, said Jennifer Taber, an associate professor of psychological science at Kent State University who studies health behaviors. If your partner needs to start exercising, for instance, suggest going on regular walks together, she said.

Call in another messenger if you have to.

It may be easier for your loved one to talk about health issues with someone else, such as a friend or a sibling, Dr. Starks said. “Because the stakes aren’t as high, where the person feels like they’re letting their partner down.”

If that’s the case, ask for help. That’s what my husband did when he called in my mother to bulldoze me on my colonoscopy. I got it done the following month, because my mom scares me more than an endoscopy camera.

High-intensity interval training workouts can be tough on your joints. Not this one.

HIIT is prized by athletes because it delivers maximum cardiovascular exercise in short bursts. But for some people, it can be punishing on the joints. Now a gentler version has emerged, known as HILIT, or high-intensity, low-impact interval training.

3e57e72ef0,The Globe and Mail,Teachers fund positions portfolio for pickup in deal-making - The Globe and Mail,"Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan is polishing up its portfolios to get ready for a pickup in deal-making, but a slow market for mergers dominated by bargain-hunting buyers is making it hard to sell assets.

Stock markets have mostly been on the rise in the first six months of this year, but owners of privately held assets have had to be patient. Teachers invests a large share of its $255.8-billion of assets in private markets, and would typically look to sell some of its long-held or lower-performing investments to recoup cash that can be used to make new deals.

With buyers and sellers still rarely seeing eye to eye, that has meant Teachers is holding on to companies, real estate and infrastructure assets for longer than it typically would before reaping the full gains from investments. And the pension fund has increased the amount of energy it devotes to maintaining and improving what it already owns – to boost returns in the near term, and to make them attractive to potential suitors when deal-making rebounds.

“We spend a lot of time trying to make sure our businesses are growing the way we would hope, but also anybody who would like to be a future owner of that business would look at it and say it’s well-run,” chief executive officer Jo Taylor said in an interview.

Teachers reported a 4.2-per-cent return on its investments in the first six months of 2024, in a mid-year update, earning $10.8-billion of investment income over that span. However, overall, the plan’s assets increased by $8.3-billion, because it paid out more in pension benefits than it took in from new contributions.

“It was a pretty good performance from all parts” of the portfolio, each of which contributed to the fund’s investment gains, Mr. Taylor said.

Over 10 years, Teachers has earned an average annual return of 7.3 per cent.

Teachers manages pensions for about 340,000 members in Ontario, including working and retired teachers.

On Tuesday, the pension fund also announced that Mabel Wong has been named chief financial officer, having served as interim CFO since her predecessor, Tim Deacon, announced in March that he was leaving to join Sun Life Financial.

Teachers is also looking to acquire new assets. The pension fund made infrastructure investments in India and invested in real estate focused on logistics in Europe in the first half of the year. But investors are still having a hard time agreeing on the growth prospects and value of assets, Mr. Taylor said. “If you’re not aligned on that then it’s quite difficult to make something happen.”

Teachers is still getting plenty of calls from potential buyers, but at the moment, “people who are out looking to buy businesses are looking for a deal,” he said. “More often than not, we’ll probably try and wait until we feel we can get full value for it.”

Making investments abroad is more fraught currently, Mr. Taylor said, with wars, geopolitical tensions and uncertainty about the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. As a result, finding the right mix of stability and growth in foreign markets is harder than it used to be, he said. But he said a recent visit from British Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves, who met with Canadian pension fund executives, sent positive signals that the United Kingdom – where Teachers is already a major investor, especially in energy – could be an attractive, predictable place to invest.

In the meantime, Teachers increased the portion of its investments that are allocated to publicly traded stocks, which now make up 15 per cent its portfolio, or $37.2-billion, compared with 10 per cent at the start of the year.

Last year, Teachers took a cautious stance toward the stock market, betting on a correction that never happened. When stock prices surged, the fund’s portfolio did well, but it missed out on the full benefits because it had lower levels of exposure.

“What we’ve tried to do is design a portfolio that’s resilient,” Mr. Taylor said. “And the recent wobble you saw in the market … actually, we were happy that our portfolio proved that it was able to absorb those fluctuations.”

Teachers trimmed its exposure to bonds, from 35 per cent of the portfolio to 33 per cent, as expectations take hold that a cycle of interest-rate cuts is coming from central banks. And it pared its exposure to credit, an asset class that has been popular but has recently shown early signs of strain, from 16 per cent to 14 per cent.",A man in a blue shirt stands in front of a concrete wall with a beige chair behind him.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BC7851510>,2024-08-13 22:17:53.114000+00:00,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-ontario-teachers-pension-plan-stocks/,['Business and Finance' 'National'],[0.95 0.7 ],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/3e57e72ef0.png
dd3cf9e5af,POLITICO,Pelosi calls Biden concerns ‘legitimate question’ in debate aftermath - POLITICO,"After last week's debate, many Democrats are privately — and publicly — sharing concerns about President Joe Biden's reelection campaign.

Not only did lawmakers watching see an uneven performance on TV, many didn't answer to questions about whether they've spoken with the president in recent months.

POLITICO reached out to more than 100 Democratic Senate and House offices — both chambers are out of session for the Fourth of July holiday this week — on Tuesday in the aftermath of Biden’s uneven debate performance last week. The vast majority did not respond to questions about when their members last interacted with the president and whether they’ve found him accessible.

Lawmakers, including very senior ones, have cited positive interactions with Biden at public events and direct communication between their staff and the White House — but none indicated direct outreach in other forums from the president in the wake of the debate.

Some pointed to conversations with chief of staff Jeff Zients and White House counselor Steve Ricchetti, but not Biden himself. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday the president had been out campaigning in the days after the debate, but he planned to reach out to Hill leaders this week and that “high-level, senior” administration officials had already talked to leadership.

It’s an indication that efforts to tamp down the private worries among elected lawmakers about Biden’s capacity to remain president for a second four-year term are still in their infancy.

“The president has spoken personally with multiple elected officials on the Hill and across the battlegrounds since the debate,” said Lauren Hitt, a Biden campaign spokesperson, without detailing who those conversations included.

Rank-and-file members don’t often get a ton of personal outreach from the president outside of formal events. But even top leaders and Biden allies hadn’t heard directly from the president in recent days.

Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), a Biden campaign co-chair who played a key role in securing the nomination for the president in 2020, said he had yet to hear from the incumbent following the debate — but indicated he had a call slated for later Tuesday.

“I've only had one of my colleagues say to me they think there should be some kind of replacement. Everybody else expressed concern, but they dug in,” he said on MSNBC Tuesday afternoon.

Clyburn added he would support Vice President Kamala Harris if Biden ""were to step aside.” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer also reiterated his support for Biden on Tuesday in comments to a reporter at an event in New York.

Jean-Pierre said Biden hadn’t called Capitol Hill Democrats because he’s been engaging “directly with supporters,” but that his senior aides had been in touch with senior party figures.

“It’s not like we were silent. It’s not like we were quiet. It’s not like we were not engaging with them — we were,” Jean-Pierre said.

Notably, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — usually a staunch defender of Biden — said Tuesday she had not heard from him since the debate, but had spoken to aides close to him.

“No, I haven't spoken to him since the debate, but I have spoken to him regularly,” Pelosi said on MSNBC. “But we all have been in touch with people close to the president, so it's not a question of not having an opportunity to make our concerns known or have some questions answered.”

A spokesperson later reiterated the former speaker has “full confidence” in Biden following the interview.

Amid those Democratic calls for unscripted interactions for Biden to demonstrate his stamina and fitness, ABC News announced Biden would sit down with George Stephanopoulos for an interview to air July 5 and over the weekend.

The relative radio silence toward Capitol Hill comes as senior Democrats are only amplifying their concerns publicly with longtime Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas on Tuesday becoming the first to call for Biden to stand down.

A handful of Democrats pointed to recent interactions with the president, though few cited outreach following the debate. And roughly a half-dozen House Democratic aides, granted anonymity to speak candidly, acknowledged that while their bosses might hobnob with Biden at events, most of the day-to-day interaction with the White House is happening at the staff level.

“We hear from [White House] staff often including from high-level people,” one aide said, adding that while their boss has interacted with Biden at “lots” of events, it’s not like former President Barack Obama was giving “huge amounts of face time” to members either.

Another House Democratic aide added that their boss has met with Biden but not often, instead mainly interacting with White House staff. A third echoed that they regularly interact with White House staff but that their boss was last with Biden in May and “does not meet with POTUS frequently.”

The office of Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said he saw Biden on Saturday — at a fundraiser in New Jersey — and described the president as “very accessible” with the longtime lawmaker always getting his calls returned. Biden was also at an event in New York with Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) on Friday a day after the debate.

Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, met with Biden when he attended a fundraiser in Connecticut in early June and flew back with the president on Air Force One, according to his office.

Speaking briefly after a pro forma session Tuesday, Sen. Laphonza Butler (D-Calif.) expressed confidence in Biden remaining the nominee. She said she’d recently spent considerable time with Biden and found he ""had a great handle on the material and topic of discussion and gave the impression to me that he is the commander in chief of the United States.""

Other Democrats defended the president’s access and alertness in other moments, both public and private. Rep. Judy Chu of California, chair of the Asian Pacific American Caucus, said in a statement she’d been with Biden recently for the signing of a proclamation and had seen him at other White House events where she “found him to be very engaged, with a lot of stamina, and interacting with so many people so positively — including with my own guests.”

Irie Sentner and Ursula Perano contributed to this report.

Sen. Joe Manchin became greatly concerned over Joe Biden’s standing after the president’s debate performance last week — so much so that he considered voicing his worries in a Sunday national TV interview before being convinced otherwise, a person familiar with his thinking confirmed to POLITICO.

In the days following the debate, Manchin (I-W.Va.) called a number of key allies to share his concerns over the president’s performance and his belief that the American people needed to hear from Biden directly.

After speaking with Biden allies — including Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) — Manchin decided against participating in a previously scheduled appearance on The Sunday Show With Jonathan Capehart, according to the person familiar.

By the time Manchin decided he wasn’t going to do the Sunday show appearance, he received a call from Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who heard about his concerns with Biden’s performance.

Manchin’s office declined to comment. Manchin’s scheduled TV interview and concerns were first reported by The Washington Post. The Senate is in recess until next week.

The Biden campaign also declined to comment on Manchin’s reaction to the president’s debate performance.

Manchin has previously used his TV appearances to make news about his positions on key issues. He once effectively ending negotiations on a version of the Biden administration’s signature Build Back Better Act on a Sunday show appearance with Fox News.

Though he was a longtime Democrat from a deeply red state, the senator recently changed his party affiliation to independent. He is not running for reelection this cycle and has endorsed a Democratic candidate to replace him.

Still, the West Virginia senator isn’t alone in his unease about the president’s performance last week. And others have not bit their tongues.

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said he was “horrified” by the debate. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) called it a ""really bad night"" for the president. And others expressed similar reactions.

On Tuesday, Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas became the first sitting congressional Democrat to call on Biden to step aside as the party nominee. Former Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, still an active member of many Democratic political circles, has said Vice President Kamala Harris should step in to replace Biden.

But a number of Democrats have continued to voice their support for the president, including Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.

Nicholas Wu contributed to this report.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Democratic leaders endorsed Rep. Cori Bush on Tuesday, giving the embattled incumbent a boost in next month's Missouri primary.

“Cori has shown up for the people of St. Louis in the fight for reproductive freedom, gun violence prevention and affordable housing. We stand together to endorse Cori Bush for re-election as we collectively work hard to make life better for everyday Americans and battle the corrosive extreme MAGA Republican agenda,” said Jeffries, House Minority Whip Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) and Caucus Chair Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) in a joint statement.

Bush, a member of the liberal Squad, has drawn a strong primary challenge this cycle from St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell.

Bell has made Israel policy part of his election pitch. Bush has been an outspoken critic of Israel and a proponent of a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war. The limited polling available in the primary shows a close race so far.

It’s not immediately clear whether Jeffries and other Democratic leaders might travel to St. Louis to campaign for Bush before the Aug. 6 primary. Democratic leaders had also endorsed her fellow Squad member, Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.), and donated money to him, but had not hit the trail for him.

Bowman lost a primary challenge to moderate opponent George Latimer last month, making him the first member of the Squad ever to lose a primary and the only Democratic incumbent defeated for renomination so far this year.

Bush, in a statement, thanked leadership for the endorsement and said: “With their support, I know we’re going to win our race in August, take back the House in November, and continue to deliver for the people and St. Louis.”

Bush has also been dogged this cycle by personal controversies, including a federal investigation into her campaign spending on security services. Bush’s now-husband had worked security for her and been paid by her campaign, though she’s denied any wrongdoing and has said she would cooperate with the investigation.

Democratic leadership has generally backed all incumbents regardless of their ideological background. But liberals have fretted this cycle about the outsize influence of groups like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which, through the super PAC United Democracy Project, has pumped millions of dollars this cycle into primary elections in an effort to oust lawmakers who have been critical of Israel and has spent or reserved $2.6 million to boost Bell and oppose Bush.","A woman in an orange blazer and pearl necklace stands with her right hand raised, gesturing towards something out of frame.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BA51D67A0>,2024-07-02 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/07/02/congress/pelosi-biden-democrats-debate-00166245,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.75],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/dd3cf9e5af.png
c89b254762,The New York Times,U.S. Sues Adobe Over Hard-to-Cancel Subscriptions - The New York Times,"U.S. regulators sued Adobe on Monday over claims that the company made it difficult to cancel subscriptions to Photoshop and other software, an escalation by regulators in a crackdown against such practices.

The Justice Department said in its lawsuit that Adobe hid details of an expensive cancellation fee from consumers “in fine print and behind optional text boxes and hyperlinks.” Adobe’s website and customer service representatives made canceling additionally challenging, according to allegations in the suit.

“Adobe knows about the barriers consumers face when attempting to cancel their subscriptions,” the government said in the lawsuit, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.

The challenge follows a similar suit by the Federal Trade Commission against Amazon last year, in which the government argued that the e-commerce giant made it hard for customers to terminate their Prime memberships. The agency has proposed new “click to cancel” rules, which would require companies to offer an easy way to stop paying for a product.

The new efforts to penalize companies with hard-to-cancel subscriptions build on a wider attempt by federal regulators to rein in Big Tech’s power. The Justice Department and the F.T.C. have filed antitrust lawsuits against Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Meta, the owner of Instagram and WhatsApp, charging that their behavior or deals stifle competition. Adobe dropped a planned $20 billion purchase of Figma, a design startup, when it faced resistance from regulators around the world last year.

In the suit against Adobe, the Justice Department named David Wadhwani, the president of its digital media business, and Maninder Sawhney, a company vice president, as defendants. The suit follows an investigation into Adobe’s practices by the F.T.C.

“We are transparent with the terms and conditions of our subscription agreements and have a simple cancellation process,” said Dana Rao, Adobe’s general counsel, in a statement. “We will refute the F.T.C.’s claims in court.”

Mr. Wadhwani and Mr. Sawhney did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Monday’s lawsuit targets Adobe’s suite of popular design software, including Photoshop, Illustrator and Acrobat. In recent years, Adobe has shifted to offering subscriptions for those products, scrapping its previous model of selling one-off licenses to use the tools.

The company earned $14.22 billion in revenue from subscriptions in 2023, up from $7.71 billion in 2019, the government said.

Adobe took steps to lock consumers into yearly subscriptions billed in monthly increments, the lawsuit argued. The overall price of the plan was often displayed in bold when customers signed up. But a reference to Adobe’s cancellation fee was displayed in lighter italic text, the government said.

Consumers had to click a separate link to see details of the early cancellation fee, which cost half of any remaining payments and applied if a customer canceled in the first year, the government said.

“Consumers can enroll in subscriptions without clicking that link, and Adobe knows most consumers do not click it before enrolling,” the lawsuit said.

Customers complained to Adobe and the Better Business Bureau about the cancellation fee, the government said.

If customers tried to cancel, the option was difficult to find on Adobe’s website. The company’s customer service line often dropped calls or bounced customers between representatives, according to the lawsuit.

“In numerous instances, subscribers who have requested to cancel through Adobe’s customer service believe they have successfully canceled but continue to be charged,” the government said. “Some of these subscribers do not realize for months that Adobe is continuing to charge them, and only learn about the charges when they review their financial accounts.”

Most of the lawsuit’s allegations related to the individual executives were sealed. The government said Mr. Wadwhani was pivotal to Adobe’s subscription business.","A man stands on stage in front of two large screens displaying Adobe's logo, with a colorful background and a cityscape.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x117 at 0x7D6B7EE1EA70>,2024-06-17 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/technology/us-adobe-subscription-lawsuit.html,['Politics' 'Business and Finance'],[0.9 0.7],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/c89b254762.png
6f578dbeb1,The Guardian,MPs to vote on winter fuel allowance cuts as Labour backbench unease grows - The Guardian,"The Labour government has confirmed that there will be a binding vote on whether to axe the winter fuel allowance for all but the poorest pensioners, as the former shadow chancellor Ed Balls said he had grave doubts about the decision.

The confirmation of the vote comes amid growing unease within the party about backing the plans. It will take place next Tuesday after the Conservatives submitted a motion to annul the government’s change to regulations – a change that ordinarily would not be subject to a vote. Labour had said previously there would be no vote on the measure.

Balls said on Thursday he thought the government needed “an escape route” from the policy and described it as “a mess”.

“They need to find a creative way to do what they said they were going to do, close the in-year black hole, and find an alternative way to do it which could either be modifying what they’re doing on the winter allowance or finding some other way to close the black hole,” he said on the Political Currency podcast.

In a sign of unrest in the parliamentary party, a number of Labour MPs have signed an early day motion asking for the change to be reconsidered and given more time to be communicated.

The motion was submitted by the new Labour MP for Poole, Neil Duncan-Jordan, who previously worked for the biggest pensioner pressure group, the National Pensioners Convention. The Guardian understands that MPs have attended briefings given by Duncan-Jordan on the implications of the change.

Two other new MPs have signed Duncan-Jordan’s motion, which is not binding on the government and is essentially symbolic. They are the Stroud MP, Dr Simon Opher, a former GP, and Chris Hinchliff, the MP for North East Hertfordshire. Others who have signed the motion include leftwing Labour MPs such as Clive Lewis and Kim Johnson.

Downing Street admitted the vote would be binding on Tuesday but declined to comment further on whipping arrangements. The Conservatives said the government had been “dragged to the House of Commons by the Conservatives to hold a vote on their cruel decision to scrap the winter fuel payment for 10 million pensioners”.

Mel Stride, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: “We welcome that the Labour government have U-turned and there will now be a vote on the Conservative motion to scrap the cruel cut to winter fuel payments. Labour thinks it is right to give their union paymasters an inflation-busting pay rise over protecting vulnerable pensioners, just as bills are going up. This tells you everything you need to know about the government’s values.

“Labour still wants to stop this vital support for the most vulnerable pensioners, but we would urge all MPs to do the right thing and back this Conservative motion to stop this punishing cut.”

After the Commons leader, Lucy Powell, confirmed on Thursday that a vote would be held, the Labour MP Rachael Maskell urged a rethink of the proposed cuts.

“Being cold at home can lead to stroke, heart attack, hypothermia, pneumonia and other such illnesses,” she said. “Will she [Powell] encourage the government to read the work of Prof Sir Michael Marmot and Sir Chris Whitty in this area, so that we can take a public health approach to people being warm at home, to mitigate the cost that could come without putting right mitigation around the winter fuel payments?”

Powell replied: “The decision to means-test winter fuel payments was not a decision that any of us wanted to take, it’s a decision we’ve had to take in order to balance the books, as we have just discussed, because it’s those on the lowest income who pay the very heaviest price when the economy crashes and the real cost of living goes through the roof.”

She added: “Getting growth in our economy, delivering lower energy bills and getting energy independence are absolutely core to this government’s agenda.”

The shadow Commons leader, Chris Philp, said he had been contacted by constituents “desperate with worry” about the proposed changes. He said one pensioner had written to him saying: “The allowance meant I could turn the heating on. Now I fear hypothermia during the coming winter months.”

Speaking on the same podcast as Balls, the former chancellor George Osborne said Reeves may have received poor advice from the Treasury. “It is a big challenge for Rachel Reeves, because she’s the new chancellor, and it was her call. She can say to the civil servants and her political advisers, ‘Why did you push me into this corner?’ But ultimately, of course, it was her decision.”","An elderly person is sitting on a couch, holding a plate, with a heater in the background and a framed picture on the wall.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BA2F8BEE0>,2024-09-05 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/sep/05/mps-vote-winter-fuel-allowance-cuts-labour-backbench-unease,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/6f578dbeb1.png
4b9104efad,Financial Times,Chipmakers face a labour crisis - Financial Times,"When will artificial intelligence start to replace human workers in a more significant way? This is a question that has become the subject of much speculation amid the AI boom. But long before we need to worry about that happening, a human worker shortage may turn out to be the biggest obstacle to the AI industry.

Sales at the world’s largest chipmaker and the maker of chips that power the AI revolution, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, rose 45 per cent in July to $7.9bn, adding to rapid growth in the second quarter. Demand for AI chips remains strong with its high-performance computing business accounting for more than half of TSMC’s revenue last quarter

Despite these stellar numbers, AI related stocks have been volatile in recent months, making investors increasingly wary of the risks at companies like TSMC — from Taiwan’s earthquakes to China-Taiwan tensions and broader geopolitical stresses. Less discussed, but just as important, is a looming crisis in shortages of engineers and technicians.

Until now, the dominant belief has been that increasing chip manufacturing capacity was simply a matter of money. The global chip shortage that started in early 2020 was addressed by governments throwing billions at chipmakers to increase capacity, preferably in their backyard. TSMC has been expanding its semiconductor factories in the US, Germany and Japan.

The US has been one of the world’s most aggressive in boosting capacity, with investments in its chip industry expected to reach more than $250bn over a five-year period. But cash, it turns out, can only go so far in chipmaking.

The problem is that making a chip factory is not as simple as setting up a new factory that assembles smartphones in another country, where local workers can be quickly hired and trained. Chip plants require highly skilled employees, with master’s and doctoral degrees in science and engineering, to run them. Even the construction of a chip fabrication plant itself requires specialist workers.

The large investment and subsequent build out of the US chip sector means more than 160,000 new job openings in engineering and technician support alongside additional openings in related construction craft jobs, according to McKinsey analysis. Yet just around 1,500 engineers join the chip industry each year. For chip technicians, that figure is even lower with just about 1,000 new technicians joining each year. In the next five years, the demand for these workers is forecast to reach 75,000

Meanwhile, the US chip manufacturing workforce has fallen 43 per cent from its peak in 2000, according to McKinsey. At the current rate, the shortage of engineers and technicians could reach as high as 146,000 workers by 2029. In South Korea, home to chipmaker Samsung Electronics, the chip industry has been dealing with a shortage since 2022 and is expected to face a labour shortage of 56,000 people by 2031, according to industry estimates.

Demographic trends are another issue. Both Taiwan and South Korea, where TSMC and Samsung have most of its workers based, are dealing with declining populations. The number of students enrolling in higher education have been falling every year since 2012. These two countries account for over 80 per cent of the world’s global contract chip manufacturing. A worker shortage has already pushed back the start date of TSMC’s Arizona plant and is reported to have flown in around half of the 2,200 workers at the plant from Taiwan. Cultural differences further complicate hiring.

As each new plant costs nearly $30bn to build, the factories need to run nonstop for 24 hours a day, seven days a week to be able to commercially justify that price tag. TSMC founder Morris Chang has pointed out that if a machine breaks down at 1am in the morning in the US it will be fixed the next morning but in Taiwan, it will be repaired at 2am. Replicating this Taiwanese work culture may be challenging in other countries.

Can’t AI just start making the chips then? Indeed, AI is helping to design, test and verify new designs and speed up development of new chips. Making the physical chips from those designs remains another story altogether. The need for experienced engineers to operate the machines is unlikely to be solved by AI anytime soon.

It is natural for companies to face difficulties filling jobs that require high levels of skills and qualifications. But for the chip sector, the jobs-workers gap is becoming dangerously wide.

a85d208ceb,The Globe and Mail,Prominent Democrat Schiff calls for Biden to withdraw as Democrats aim to nominate before convention - The Globe and Mail,"California Rep. Adam Schiff on Wednesday became the highest-profile Democrat to call for President Joe Biden to drop his re-election bid, even as the party pushed ahead with plans for a virtual vote to formally make Biden its nominee in the first week of August.

The move to schedule the roll call, which would come weeks before the Democratic National Convention opens in Chicago on Aug. 19, follows nearly 20 Democratic members of Congress calling on Biden to withdraw from the presidential race in the wake of his dismal debate performance against Republican former President Donald Trump last month.

Among Democrats nationwide, nearly two-thirds say Biden should step aside and let his party nominate a different candidate, according to a new AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll – sharply undercutting Biden’s post-debate claim that “average Democrats” are still with him even if some “big names” are turning on him.

“While the choice to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden’s alone, I believe it is time for him to pass the torch,” Schiff said in a statement. “And in doing so, secure his legacy of leadership by allowing us to defeat Donald Trump in the upcoming election.”

Schiff is a prominent Democrat on his own, and his statement will also be watched because of his proximity to Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi.

It was Pelosi who revived questions about Biden post-debate, when she said recently that “it’s up to the president” to decide what to do – even though Biden had fully stated he had no intention of stepping aside. The former House speaker publicly supports the president, but has fielded calls from Democrats since debate night questioning what’s next.

In response to Schiff’s comments, the Biden campaign pointed to what it called “extensive support” for him and his re-election bid from members of Congress in key swing states, as well as from the Congressional Black and Hispanic caucuses. Biden is travelling in Nevada this week, and the campaign noted that he’s been joined on the trip by “nearly a dozen” Congressional Black Caucus members.

Still, Schiff’s announcement came after Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries encouraged the party to delay for a week plans to hold the virtual vote to renominate Biden, which could have taken place as soon as Sunday, according to two people familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.

The Democratic National Committee’ s rule making arm is set to meet on Friday to discuss how the virtual vote plans will work and to finalize them next week.

“We will not be implementing a rushed virtual voting process, though we will begin our important consideration of how a virtual voting process would work,” Bishop Leah D. Daughtry and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, co-chairs of the rules committee for the Democratic National Convention wrote in a letter Wednesday.

The letter also said that the virtual roll call vote won’t take place before Aug. 1, but that the party is still committed to holding a vote before Aug. 7, which had been the filing deadline to get on Ohio’s presidential ballot.

The Democratic convention runs in person from Aug. 19-22, but the party announced in May that it would hold an early roll call to ensure Biden would qualify for the ballot in Ohio. That state originally had an Aug. 7 deadline but has since changed its rules.

The Biden campaign insists that the party must operate under Ohio’s initial rules to ensure Republican lawmakers can’t mount legal challenges to keep the president off the ballot.

Even if Democrats conduct a virtual roll call vote ahead of their convention, though, it wouldn’t necessarily lock Biden into the nomination. The DNC rule making arm could vote to hold an in-person roll call in Chicago, said Elaine Kamarck, a long-time member of the party’s rules committee and expert on the party’s nominating process. But since the Ohio law doesn’t go into effect until Sept. 1, Biden appearing on the state’s ballot remains a real concern, Kamarck said.

“This is a fail-safe for the Democrats,” Kamarck said, adding that “the convention is the highest authority” in the nominating process.

The AP-NORC poll, conducted as Biden works to salvage his candidacy two weeks after his debate flop, also found that only about 3 in 10 Democrats are extremely or very confident that he has the mental capability to serve effectively as president, down slightly from 40% in an AP-NORC poll in February.

The letter from Daughtry and Walz comes a day after a contingent of House Democrats wary of swiftly nominating Biden as the party’s pick for re-election circulated another letter raising “serious concerns” about plans for a virtual roll call. Their letter to theDNC, which has not been sent, says it would be a “terrible idea” to stifle debate about the party’s nominee with the early roll call vote.

“It could deeply undermine the morale and unity of Democrats,” said the letter obtained by the AP.

A spokesperson said that Huffman was pleased with the decision to delay and would hold off sending the letter from House Democrats as they continue monitoring the situation.","A man in a dark suit stands at a podium with the Presidential Seal, gesturing with his right hand, in front of a backdrop with 'Vote to Live' text.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6B7F035930>,2024-07-17 15:22:52.552000+00:00,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/us-politics/article-democrats-to-hold-virtual-vote-to-make-biden-partys-nominee-in-first/,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/a85d208ceb.png
aef824f0cb,The New York Times,"Fallout From Cyberattack at Ascension Hospitals Persists, Causing Delays in Patient Care - The New York Times","In more than a dozen states, doctors and nurses have resorted to paper and handwritten treatment orders to chart patient illnesses and track them, unable to access the detailed medical histories that have long been available only through computerized records.

Patients have waited for long stints in emergency rooms, and their treatments have been delayed while lab results and readings from machines like M.R.I.s are ferried through makeshift efforts lacking the speed of electronic uploads.

For more than two weeks, thousands of medical personnel have turned to manual methods after a cyberattack on Ascension, one of the nation’s largest health systems with about 140 hospitals in 19 states and the District of Columbia.

The large-scale attack on May 8 was eerily reminiscent of the hack of Change Healthcare, a unit of UnitedHealth Group that manages the nation’s largest health care payment system. The assault shut down Change’s digital billing and payment routes, leaving hospitals, doctors and pharmacists without ways to communicate with health insurers for weeks. Patients were unable to fill prescriptions, and providers could not get paid for care.

While some earlier cyberattacks affected a single hospital or smaller medical networks, the breakdown at Change, which handles a third of all U.S. patient records, underscored the dangers of consolidation when one entity becomes so essential to the nation’s health system.

Ascension systems remain down indefinitely, but doctors and nurses are working to find ways of getting access to some information about patients’ medical histories by looking at health records kept by other providers. Ascension is also telling doctors and nurses that they will soon be able to see existing digital records.

“It is a huge disruption for everyone involved,” said Kristine Kittelson, a nurse with Ascension Seton Medical Center in Austin, Texas, who is a member of the National Nurses United union.

The Ascension attack has had a similarly widespread impact as Change, with some hospitals in Indiana, Michigan and elsewhere diverting ambulances. Ascension hospitals handle roughly three million emergency room visits a year and perform nearly 600,000 surgeries.

Like Change, Ascension was the subject of a ransomware attack, and the hospital group says it is working with federal law enforcement agencies. The attack appears to be the work of a group known as Black Basta, which may be linked to Russian-speaking cybercriminals, according to news reports.

There are concerns that the hackers could release private medical information, and patients have already begun filing federal lawsuits against Ascension saying it did not do enough to safeguard their data.

Large health care organizations have increasingly become a prime target for cybercriminals, intent on creating as much havoc as they can on a vital part of the U.S. infrastructure. “This is something that is going to happen over and over again,” said Steve Cagle, the chief executive of Clearwater, a health care compliance firm.

With a sprawling network of hospitals and clinics, big organizations have not yet identified where they are vulnerable and how to minimize the disruption of a serious attack. The industry “never planned for this,” Mr. Cagle said.

While Ascension continues to treat patients, the dangers of missing pieces of a patient’s history are palpable. In interviews, doctors and nurses outlined the threats to patient care: People may not remember what medications they are taking; previous visits may be omitted as well as the outcome of earlier procedures or tests.

In Austin, Ms. Kittelson said she had to search through dozens of pieces of paper to find what medication a doctor may have ordered or to find something about the patient’s status. “I’m worried about the charting,” she said, noting that she had been painstakingly chronicling a patient’s condition and treatment by hand.

And many of the routine safeguards have not been available. Nurses couldn’t scan a medicine and a patient’s wristband to make sure the right patient was getting the right drug, increasing the odds of a medication error. And they have grown far less certain that doctors have received important updates of a patient’s status.

“Our big issue is that the cyberattack has crippled the nurses,” said Lisa Watson, a union nurse at an Ascension hospital in Wichita, Kan. She noted that the workload had significantly increased.

“This is much more than the old-time paper charting,” Ms. Watson said. Nurses have had to write prescriptions and other treatments on separate forms that go to different departments. Instead of getting immediate alerts on a computer, a nurse may not see a new lab result for hours.

On Tuesday, Ascension said it was “making progress in both restoring operations and reconnecting our partners into the network,” and some nurses say they may soon have limited access to previous records. But Ascension has not offered a timeline for restoration of full digital access, saying in an emailed statement Tuesday night only that “it will take time to return to normal operations.”

Few providers were willing to publicly discuss the extent of the damage wrought by the ransomware attacks, across many states and medical departments. The havoc has yet to be fully assessed, and Ascension is intent on keeping as much of its operations open as possible.

Union nurses say the cyberattack has worsened staffing shortages. The issue has dogged labor relations with Ascension, although the company has denied it. Nurses in Wichita recently clashed with the hospital’s management over whether there were too few nurses in the intensive care unit.

“Despite the challenges posed by the recent ransomware attack, patient safety continues to be our utmost priority,” Ascension said in an emailed statement. “Our dedicated doctors, nurses and care teams are demonstrating incredible thoughtfulness and resilience as we utilize manual and paper-based systems during the ongoing disruption to normal systems.”

“Our care teams are well versed on dynamic situations and are appropriately trained to maintain high-quality care during downtime,” it added. “Our leadership, physicians, care teams and associates are working to ensure patient care continues with minimal to no interruption.”

Ascension said it would tell patients if an appointment or a procedure might need to be rescheduled. The organization has not yet determined whether sensitive patient data has been compromised, and it is referring the public to its website for updates.

An added concern is whether sensitive patient information has been compromised and who should be held accountable. In the fallout from the Change attack, doctors are pushing U.S. government health officials to make clear that Change bears responsibility for alerting patients. According to a letter from the American Medical Association and other physician groups earlier this week, doctors urged officials to “publicly state that its breach investigation and immediate efforts at remediation will be focused on Change Healthcare, and not the providers affected by Change Healthcare’s breach.”

These kinds of ransomware attacks have become increasingly common, as cybercriminals, often backed by criminals with ties to foreign states like Russia or China, have determined just how lucrative and disruptive targeting large health organizations can be. UnitedHealth’s chief executive, Andrew Witty, recently told Congress the company paid $22 million in ransom to cybercriminals.

The Change attack has drawn a lot more government attention to the problem. The White House and federal agencies have held several meetings with industry officials, and Congress asked Mr. Witty to appear earlier this month to discuss the hack in detail. Many lawmakers pointed to the increasing size of health care organizations as a reason the nation’s delivery of medical care to millions of Americans has become increasingly vulnerable.

Experts in cybersecurity say hospitals have little choice but to shut their systems down if a hacker manages to gain entry. Because the criminals infiltrate the entire computer system, “hospitals have no choice but to go to paper,” said Errol Weiss, chief security officer for the Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center, which he described as a virtual neighborhood watch for the industry.",An emergency sign is displayed on a building at night with lights on in the background.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x117 at 0x7D6BCAEA0250>,2024-05-23 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/health/cyberattack-ascension-hospitals-patient-data.html,['Health' 'Business and Finance' 'Technology'],[0.95 0.65 0.6 ],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/aef824f0cb.png
088c34e919,The Globe and Mail,Sicily ‘will become a desert’ as grapes shrivel on the vine and lakes become puddles - The Globe and Mail,"In Agrigento, Sicily, locals wait at the lone functioning fountain to fill 25-litre plastic jugs with fresh water. In the same city, many hotels are closed, since there is not enough water for showers and toilets. Some farmers in the driest parts of the island are slaughtering their goats and cows rather than watch them die slowly of thirst. Lakes are turning into puddles. Grapes are shrivelling on the vine.

Sicily, the largest island in the Mediterranean, with a population of 4.8 million, is experiencing a climate crisis that has produced the most severe drought in living Sicilian memory. Vast tracts of the island are devoid of any green vegetation and seem well on their way to turning to desert.

“We could look like Tunisia,” Christian Mulder, professor of ecology and climate emergency at the University of Catania, told The Globe and Mail in late August on a scorching hot day. “But this climate emergency is part of a trend. It’s not a surprise.”

What is a surprise is that governments at the national, regional and local levels have done virtually nothing to mitigate the effects of extreme temperatures and rainfall shortages in Sicily, even though climate scientists have warned for decades that the island is burning up.

Water infrastructure – wells, canals, pipes, dams, reservoirs, pumps – is so decrepit that Sicilians refer to their leaky water system as a “colander.” ISTAT, the national statistics agency, estimated in 2022 that Sicilian water network losses were almost 52 per cent.

But even if water losses were less severe – no water system anywhere is leak-proof – Sicily probably would remain a poster child for the European climate crisis, though it has competition in southern Europe. The winter of 2023-24 was Greece’s warmest, for instance. In June and July, Athens set record highs, with daytime temperatures often exceeding 40 degrees. In Greece, wildfires are common and sometimes deadly.

Europeans live on the fastest-warming continent, with temperatures rising at roughly twice the global average, the UN’s World Meteorological Organization and the European Union’s Copernicus climate agency said in a recent joint report. The latest five-year averages show that temperatures are running 2.3 degrees above pre-industrial levels – dangerously above the 2015 Paris Agreement’s goal to limit increases to 1.5 degrees – compared with 1.3 degrees higher globally, the report says.

Sicily itself is at the centre of the heat storm. A European record high of 48.8 degrees was reached on the island in 2021. Sicily is warming so fast that some farmers have started to grow tropical fruit, including mangoes, bananas, avocados and papayas. Since 2021, they have even been growing coffee beans. The world’s coffee belt is in the equatorial countries such as Brazil, Guatemala and Ethiopia – not Europe.

Traditional crops, notably citrus fruits, are at risk, which could have shopping implications throughout Europe, since Italy is the continent’s second-biggest producer of oranges, lemons and limes, after Spain. Most of the Italian production comes from the south, including Sicily. A variety of grains and grasses, such as hay, are under threat, too, making livestock food scarce in some areas of the island.

But Sicily’s embrace of tropical and semi-tropical agricultural fruits may not prove to be the salvation it yearns for, since even those fruits require water from rain-fed aquifers and reservoirs. Avocados are especially water hungry. Where will that water come from on a parched island? In Sicily, the rainfall required to nourish the reservoirs and underground aquifers is running near historic lows and water rationing was put in place in nearly 100 municipalities in March.

The gradual disappearance of Lake Pergusa, the island’s only natural lake, located near the central Sicilian town of Enna, has alarmed Sicilians. The lake, described by the Roman poet Ovid as an “eternal spring,” once covered 1.8 square kilometres. Today, it is little more than a puddle.

Farmers pray for water – and pay ever-rising prices for it to be delivered by tanker truck or by pipe. Reports of farmers resorting to expensive bottled water for their cooking or to wash themselves have appeared in the Sicilian press.

It’s known, and widely reported, that some criminal groups are making fortunes from “black-market” water. They use tanker trucks to steal the water at night from reservoirs, or slash open pipes to drain them. Of course, the wrecked pipes add to the water losses.

The president of Sicily, Renato Schifani, has called the drought “a national emergency.”

At the September G7 meeting in Siracusa, Sicily, climate change will be a central issue on the agenda, Prof. Mulder said.

Coldiretti, the Italian farming association, estimated that the agricultural losses associated with the Sicilian drought came to €2.7-billion (about $4-billion) in the first seven months of this year.

Salvatore (Toti) Fanara is one farmland operator – he does not describe himself as a “farmer” per se – who is struggling to keep fruit crops, mostly grapes, pomegranates and lemons, alive on land owned by his sisters. He is on the verge of giving up hope, as the drought and painfully high temperatures, which boost evaporation rates, prove relentless.

Mr. Fanara, 54, worked for more than 20 years in New York as a graphic designer. He traded Manhattan for Sicily in 2019 when his father died and his sisters needed help maintaining their fruit terrain about 15 minutes beyond Agrigento, a hilltop town on Sicily’s southwest coast. Their most important crop is green table grapes from 3,000 plants. The grapes are prized all over Europe. Carrefour, the French supermarket giant, is one of their biggest buyers.

As a kid, Mr. Fanara remembers his grandfather driving him to the property in an old Volkswagen Beetle. “We would drive through a creek and the water would rise above the floorboards of the car,” he said. “That creek has been dried up for years. We have no water on the property.”

The terrain’s water costs are horrendous. Much of the water comes from a small rented reservoir nearby. The cost of transporting the water through a network of PVC tubes and operating and maintaining a diesel pump alone are at least €200 a day, he said. He can’t afford more and his grapes and pomegranates are suffering.

His workers have been trimming back the delicate clusters of hanging grapes, sacrificing the dying ones to spare the rest. Still, many of the grapes that avoided the cut have shrivelled or turned dry and black. The pomegranates this season are about half the size they were last season. He expects his grape production to fall by half this year.

“We have been losing money for the last few years,” he said. “The scientists who were doing research on climate 20 years ago and ringing the alarm bell were proven right. We have to do something different, ourselves. We may have to sell the land or cover it with solar panels.”

There are similar stories of woe throughout Sicily. Near Catania, the main city on Sicily’s east coast, the family of Antonio Bonaccorsi, 41, owns two separate terrains, covering 57 hectares, that were first assembled by his ancestors in 1870. They grow mostly avocados, lemons and oranges. The reservoir that has fed the bigger property is filled to only 8-per-cent capacity. Only a couple of months ago, it was at one-third capacity.

To make up for the shortfall, Mr. Bonaccorsi has relied on deliveries from a public-private consortium that operates a water network. Severe shortages prevented him from receiving any water in July and August. “I could go bankrupt in September if water deliveries do not come,” he said. “If Sicily continues down this road, it will become a desert.”

He was referring to the chronic lack of maintenance and upgrades on the island’s water-supply network. Three of Sicily’s desalinization plants fell into disrepair decades ago and no longer work. The plants are set to undergo a €90-million overhaul to bring them back to life. But desalinization alone is no magic cure, since the process is expensive, produces water that many farmers cannot afford and creates planet-warming carbon-dioxide emissions.

The island requires billions of euros of investment to upgrade its water system. The money is only trickling in, and the lack of hydraulic engineers and project-management expertise in Sicily means any improvements will be hard won and will probably come too late.

What seems certain is that the steady rise in temperatures and decline in rainfall in recent years will endure. The island faces a grim future unless, at minimum, it can drastically reduce water leakage and theft. According to the Italian National Research Council, 70 per cent of Sicily is at risk of desertification.

Mr. Fanara, for one, doubts Sicily will work fast enough to fix its water problems. “There is no future in farming here,” he said.

71b239713a,CBS News,Dogs found with chains around necks at Detroit-area drive-in movie theater - CBS News,"(CBS DETROIT) - A Detroit-area animal shelter is offering a $1,000 reward after two dogs were found with chains locked around their necks on Sunday.

The dogs, named Gilligan and Skipper, were brought to the Friends for the Animals of Metro Detroit shelter by Dearborn Animal Control after they were found by residents at the Ford-Wyoming Drive-In Move Theater.

Gilligan, a 5-year-old Hound mix, was in ""horrific condition"" and was found dragging two tow chains that weighed 18 pounds, which is more than half his weight.

The chains were padlocked around his neck and were embedded into his neck, with skin starting to grow over the chain. The dog was taken to an emergency service center, where the chain was removed, and the wound was debrided, according to animal shelter staff.

Gilligan will need bandages changed daily to ensure the wound heals correctly.

Another dog, Skipper, was found with Gilligan. He also had a chain around his neck, which was fastened with a carabiner. He had some hair loss and some fly strikes on his ears.

Although both dogs are thin, the animal shelter staff says they are expected to recover fully.

The shelter is offering a $1,000 reward for information that could lead to the arrest, prosecution and conviction of whoever is responsible for mistreating these dogs.

Anyone with information should call Friends for Animals of Metro Detroit at 313-943-2697.

""Gilligan and Skipper are survivors,"" said Friends for Animals of Metro Detroit President Cory Keller. ""Who knows how long they were living in these conditions. Gilligan is extremely lucky he received the help when he did. This could have been a deadly outcome for him if left untreated. I cannot imagine the pain and suffering he went through carrying this heavy tow chain around his neck for weeks, if not months. This is something that does not happen overnight. Skipper was also very lucky that it did not get to the extent like it did with Gilligan.

40e43e0e85,New York Post,"Biden freezes before Medicare, jobs gaffes minutes into CNN debate with Trump - New York Post","President Biden froze and then had a verbal blunder, saying he “beat Medicare,” minutes after he kicked off his debate with former President Donald Trump on Thursday and touted the “15,000 new jobs” he created as commander-in-chief.

The 81-year-old president was discussing his record on the economy when he appeared to lose his train of thought.

“We be able to help make sure that all those things we need to do, child care, elder care, making sure that we continue to strengthen our health care system, making sure that we’re able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I’ve been able to do with the, with the COVID, excuse me, dealing with everything we have to do with…,” Biden said before freezing for several seconds.

“We finally beat Medicare,” he continued.

“He did beat Medicare. He beat it to death,” Trump, 78, responded.

The blunder was Biden’s second of the night.

During his response to the first question of the CNN debate, when he was asked about what he would say to voters who feel worse off under his presidency, Biden said: “[The] unemployment rate rose to 15% [under Trump], it was terrible. And so what we had to do is try to put things back together again. That’s exactly what we began to do.

“We created 15,000 new jobs,” he added, possibly meaning to say “15 million new jobs.”

Biden’s propensity to misspeak has resulted in more than 150 adjustments to official White House transcripts of his remarks this year alone, including nine in one day after he delivered a gaffe-riddled speech to the NAACP in Detroit in May.

The commander-in-chief referred to the NAACP as “the NAAC,” called Capitol rioters “irrectionists,” announced that he was “humbled to receive this organization [he meant ‘award’]” and said he was vice president “during the pandemic” during that particular slip-up spree.

Weeks earlier, during a ritzy campaign fundraiser at the Westchester home of Hollywood stars Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, the president fumbled the date of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol — a key event in Biden’s re-election pitch.

We just witnessed the end of Joe Biden’s presidency

“We’ll certainly never forget the dark days of June 6,” Biden said, before self-correcting: “January 6th, excuse me. One of the dark days in history.”

The president’s verbal blunders have also come during high-profile events, such as his State of the Union addresses.

“Putin may circle Kyiv with tanks,” Biden declared less than a week into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, during his first State of the Union speech in March 2022.

“But he will never gain the hearts and souls of the Iranian people.”

His inadvertent rallying cry for the people of Iran led Vice President Kamala Harris, who was seated behind Biden, to mouth “Ukrainian” as the president forged ahead with his speech.

In his 2024 State of the Union speech, Biden once again stunned listeners when he went off script to acknowledge the murder of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley.

“I know how to say her name. Lincoln — Lincoln Riley, an innocent young woman who was killed by an illegal,” Biden said, both botching the slain student’s name and using a term considered politically incorrect by most Democrats.

Just in the last year, the commander-in-chief has also flubbed the names of current and former leaders of Mexico, Egypt, France, Germany and Ukraine.

Last July, Biden referred to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as “Vladimir” during a NATO summit in Lithuania, apparently confusing him with Russian leader and US and Ukrainian adversary Vladimir Putin.

In February, Biden mixed up Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador during a news conference at which he defended himself from accusations in former special counsel Robert Hur’s report that he had a “poor memory.”

“As you know, initially, the president of Mexico, Sisi, did not want to open up the gate to allow humanitarian material to get in [to Gaza],” Biden said as he answered a question from a reporter about the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip.

“I talked to him. I convinced him to open the gate.”

That same week — on three separate occasions — the president told an audience that he discussed the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol with European leaders who were actually dead at the time.

He told Democratic donors in New York, at two different events, on Feb. 7 that he spoke about the riot with former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose death pre-dates the event by nearly half a decade, when he apparently meant to say former German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

“Helmut Kohl said, ‘Joe, what would you think if you picked up the phone and picked up the paper tomorrow and learned in the London Times, on the front page, that 1,000 people stormed the Parliament, broke down the doors of the House of Commons and killed two bobbies in the process … trying to stop the election of a prime minister?’” Biden said at one of the fundraisers, switching it up to “Helmut Kohl of Germany” during the telling of a nearly identical anecdote at the other event.

Kohl died in 2017.

Biden stumbled through the same story days earlier, on Feb. 4 in Las Vegas, with one of the only differences being that he recalled former French President Francois Mitterrand presenting him with the hypothetical.

Mitterrand died in 1996.

Biden apparently meant to say current French President Emmanuel Macron.

More recently, the president has appeared to momentarily freeze up in public.

Earlier this month, he had to be led offstage by former President Barack Obama at the end of a campaign fundraiser in Los Angeles.

As Biden and his former boss stood for applause, the octogenarian president’s gaze seemed to become fixed on the crowd for a full 10 seconds until Obama took him by the wrist and escorted him behind the curtains.

Just days earlier, during a lively Juneteenth musical performance at the White House, Biden remained virtually motionless for nearly a minute as the vice president, the second gentleman and other dignitaries on the South Lawn all danced around him.

Biden was only roused when Philonise Floyd, the brother of the late George Floyd, wrapped his arm around the president.

Hur noted in his February report on Biden’s handling of classified White House documents that Hur opted against recommending criminal charges against the president in part because a jury might view Biden as an “elderly man with a poor memory.”

Biden couldn’t recall the years he served as Obama’s vice president or when his son Beau Biden died, according to Hur’s report.

In September 2022, the president searched out then-recently deceased Indiana Rep. Jackie Walorski during an event in Washington, saying, “Jackie — are you here? Where’s Jackie?” despite the fact that he had publicly mourned Walorski’s high-profile death the previous month.

“I think she was going to be here,” Biden added.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre dismissed Biden’s confusion, claiming that the late congresswoman was “top of mind” for the president.

More recently, Biden’s bizarre behavior during the G7 summit in Italy earlier this month reportedly shocked US allies.

Biden gave Giorgia Meloni an awkward salute upon greeting the prime minister of the host nation, and later wandered away from his fellow world leaders during a skydiving demonstration, forcing Meloni to chaperone him back to the group.

Public polling over the past year has consistently shown that large majorities of voters are concerned about Biden’s mental fitness for office.

A New York Times/Siena College poll released Wednesday found that 70% viewed the president as too old to be effective in office, including a majority of his supporters.

Meanwhile, only 40% felt the same about former President Donald Trump, who is 78.

Biden, the oldest president in American history, would be 86 by the end of a second term in the White House.","A man in a suit stands at a podium with a microphone, gesturing with his right hand, in front of a backdrop with the CNN logo repeated across it.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BCAEEA080>,2024-06-27 00:00:00+00:00,https://nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2024/06/27/us-news/biden-freezes-before-medicare-jobs-gaffes-minutes-into-cnn-debate-with-trump/,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/40e43e0e85.png

MILWAUKEE — Not four years after Donald Trump’s eldest son boasted that the Republican Party belonged not to traditional Republicans but to his father, GOP delegates gathered at their nominating convention proved his point this week, demonstrating their obeisance to a convicted criminal who tried to end American democracy because he lost his reelection.

“Tonight, with faith and devotion, I proudly accept your nomination for president of the United States,” Trump said to wild cheers on Thursday night, exactly three years, five months and 28 days after leaving the White House in disgrace following his failed coup attempt.

Trump’s campaign aides have been pushing stories about how Saturday’s assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania had made him a more spiritual person and how Trump would offer a unifying message. And at the start, Trump did indeed offer a more somber tone.

“There was blood pouring everywhere, but in a certain way I felt very protected, because I felt that I had God on my side,” Trump said. He mentioned the retired fire chief who had been killed at the rally and showed his jacket and helmet, which had been brought on stage.

“I’m not supposed to be here tonight,” he said.

The new tone lasted 17 minutes.

Then, he called on state and federal prosecutors to drop all four criminal cases against him, including the one in which he was convicted of 34 felony counts in May.

“The Democrat party should immediately stop weaponizing the justice system and labeling their political opponent as an enemy of democracy,” he said.

At the 25 minute mark, Trump called former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi “crazy.” Eight minutes later, he accused Democrats of cheating in elections. Four minutes later, he insulted the news media, referring to the CBS News program “Face the Nation” as “Deface the Nation.”

And 38 minutes in, he repeated the lie that he used to incite the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol — that the 2020 election had been stolen from him through cheating. Immediately after that, he made liars out of staffers who had told reporters that he would never mention the name of the man who had defeated him, claiming Biden, by name, was worse than the previous 10 worst presidents combined.

The speech devolved from there into Trump’s standard, oft-used rhetoric from his rally speeches — that the economy on his watch was the best ever; that his trade agreements were marked improvements over the previous ones; that crime is currently out of control; and so on.

He also repeated promises and warnings with no basis in fact: that he would be able to balance the budget merely by increasing oil and gas production, or that an ongoing influx of illegal migrants would bankrupt Social Security and Medicare.

Through the entire 92-minute address, Trump won sustained adulation from the thousands of delegates, alternates and guests packed into Fiserv Forum, the home of the Milwaukee Bucks NBA team — although attentions began wandering at the 75 minute mark, as delegates began checking their phones.

It was a dramatic evolution from his first Republican National Convention eight years ago.

In 2016, a sizeable number of Republican activists gathered at the convention in Cleveland tried to take the nomination away from Trump because of his treatment of women, his racism, his history of cheating contractors in business, his uneven history on abortion and his open praise of dictators like Vladimir Putin.

Eight years later, all of those characteristics remain true, but Trump is now also a twice-impeached former president. And a court-adjudicated sexual abuser who, according to the trial, in the common parlance raped a woman. And a would-be autocrat who tried to overturn an election he lost. And, most recently, a convicted felon.

And yet, there was not even the whisper of open dissent this week, with speakers and delegates both instead attacking the police, prosecutors and judges involved in the criminal and civil cases against their leader.

“What can I say,” said one dispirited Republican National Committee member on condition of anonymity. “Here we are.”

In political conventions past, former presidents and nominees were treated as elder statesmen, with prominent speaking slots. At Trump’s convention, there is none of that.

Former President George W. Bush, former Vice President Dan Quayle and former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney are all in good health, but none has a place in the new Trump party. Also unwelcome are Trump’s own former vice president, Mike Pence, and many of his top advisers, who instead have warned that Trump’s lack of fidelity to the Constitution makes him unfit to hold the office.

Instead, the speaking lineup leading up to Trump’s acceptance speech featured conspiracy theorist Tucker Carlson, former professional wrestler and self-acknowledged racist Hulk Hogan and lawyer Alina Habba, who may be best known for representing Trump in a lawsuit he lost against a woman who said Trump had raped her and repeatedly defamed her by lying about it. The penultimate speaker, the one who introduced Trump onstage, was ultimate fighting impresario Dana White, whose caught-on-camera physical abuse of his wife in the past would have made his presence impossible, but which in the new Republican Party scarcely warrants a mention.

“Eight years, two impeachments, four indictments, 34 felony convictions, and one attempted coup later, the GOP is now fully 100% Trump’s party,” said Joe Walsh, once a Republican congressman from Illinois who broke with Trump early in his presidency. “And that speaks less to Trump’s strength, and much more to Republican fear and cowardice.”

The views of Walsh, who tried running against Trump in the 2020 GOP primary but dropped out after the Iowa caucuses, were not at all reflective, though, of the tens of thousands of attendees drawn from pro-Trump activists across the country.

Peter Quaglia, a former federal agent in the Department of Homeland Security, said none of the criminal cases against Trump bothers him, even the New York falsification of business records case on which Trump may be sentenced to prison in September. “I’m not even remotely concerned about it,” he said.

Carolyn Welsh, who is 80 and retired after serving five four-year terms as sheriff of Chester County in Pennsylvania, also does not see any of the criminal cases as a problem. “I have a shirt that says: I voted for the felon,” she said.

Two of the outstanding felony prosecutions against Trump are based on his coup attempt that culminated in Jan. 6 Capitol assault. On the day of the attack, at a rally just beforehand, Donald Trump Jr., who also spoke at this year’s Republican convention, declared his father’s mastery of the party.

“This gathering should send a message to them,” the younger Trump told tens of thousands of his father’s followers gathered near the White House, referring to “weak” Republicans who had not agreed to help overturn his election loss. “This isn’t their Republican Party anymore. This is Donald Trump’s Republican Party.”

This week, Trump’s top campaign adviser, Chris LaCivita, used nearly identical language in an interview with The New York Times. He explained why the campaign had essentially shut down the process of letting delegates draft the party’s platform, and instead presented one to them as a fait accompli:

Stepparents would like a word. - The Washington Post,"When Ella Emhoff graduated from college in 2021, Vice President Harris posed smiling beside her stepdaughter. At Cole Emhoff’s wedding in October, Harris officiated her stepson’s ceremony. The Emhoff siblings have affectionately dubbed Harris “Momala,” a name she has said she wears proudly.

But Harris’s parental role was altogether erased in recent and resurfaced attacks from her political opponents. In a video drawn from a 2021 interview on Fox News’s “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” J.D. Vance, now the GOP vice-presidential nominee, said that Harris and other prominent Democrats (including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) “don’t really have a direct stake” in the country’s future because they are “people without children.” In the clip, which has amassed more than 25 million views since it was shared Monday on X, Vance also refers to Democrats as “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices they’ve made.”

Others on the right have echoed Vance’s argument: Will Chamberlain, a conservative commentator and former Ron DeSantis staffer, posted on X on Sunday that a “really simple, underdiscussed reason why Kamala Harris shouldn’t be President” is that she has “no children.”

Among the torrent of outraged replies online, many offered corrections to these claims: Buttigieg and his husband, Chasten, announced the birth of their twins in September 2021. Past presidents have been child-free (including James K. Polk and James Buchanan). George Washington did not have biological offspring; he was a stepparent who helped raise his wife’s children from a previous marriage.

And members of Harris’s own family soon issued their own rebuttals: Kerstin Emhoff, the ex-wife of second gentleman Douglas Emhoff, rejected Vance’s criticism of Harris as “baseless attacks” in a statement to CNN. “For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I,” Emhoff said. “She is loving, nurturing, fiercely protective, and always present. I love our blended family and am grateful to have her in it.”

On Thursday, Ella Emhoff shared her mother’s statement on Instagram: “How can you be ‘childless’ when you have cutie pie kids like Cole and I,” she added. “I love my three parents.”

Harris’s relationships with Cole and Ella deserve respect and recognition, says Jann Blackstone, a co-parenting mediator, author and founder of the nonprofit Bonus Families, which supports divorced or separated parents and their combined families.

Blackstone, who has two stepchildren — she prefers the term “bonus children” — knows firsthand the lingering stereotypes and misconceptions that have long plagued stepparents, and stepmothers in particular: “That they’re not the real mom. That they don’t count. That they’re second-best,” Blackstone says. Over the decades that Blackstone has worked with blended families, she says, she has seen the toll that these judgments can take on devoted caregivers.

But she has also seen more and more people accept and embrace the idea of blended families, which made Vance’s comments feel especially jarring, she says. “To say something like this seems so backwards to me. It’s just not our reality,” she says. According to a 2015 Pew Research Center report, 16 percent of American children are living in “blended families” — a household with a stepparent, stepsibling or half sibling — and 8 percent of children are living with a stepparent.

Blackstone adds that her reaction has nothing to do with Vance’s or Harris’s politics: “I don’t make judgments on people’s political decisions, as far as who I’m going to vote for, or who they’re going to vote for,” she says. “But the family system is changing, and to make a comment like that … it’s just not helpful to society. We don’t need people to say, like, ‘You aren’t qualified to be president because you don’t have children.’ I want bonus parents to be respected as a parental figure.”

For Rebecca Brodey, the vice president’s highly visible relationship with Ella and Cole has felt significant for years. “I feel so much solidarity with other stepmoms,” says Brodey, a mother of three, including two stepchildren, in D.C. “So I also feel solidarity with Kamala Harris. When ‘Momala’ was first put in the news, I jokingly said to my stepkids, ‘Why don’t you call me MaBecca?’ and now as a joke my stepdaughter has me in her phone as MaBecca.”

Brodey is close with her two stepchildren, she says, both of whom are teens. But she has also sometimes struggled with a role that is frequently overlooked or confronted with skepticism.

“My experience as a stepmom is that, at the outset, I’m normally met with distrust,” she says. “It’s just part of the role that you have to prove yourself, you have to demonstrate that you are there to support the kids, that you respect the ex, that you’re a loving person.”

So when she considers the recent condemnation of Harris, “I just roll my eyes,” she says. “It’s not surprising to me that they’re going to invalidate her role as a caretaker and as someone who is invested in the future of her stepchildren.”

It didn’t surprise Matthew Brake either. The stepfather of three says he’s noticed anti-stepparent sentiments growing in recent years, primarily in certain right-leaning corners of the internet.

Story continues below advertisement

The clip from Vance’s interview reminded Brake of a social media post he saw circulating a couple of years ago, around the time he was planning to ask his wife to marry him. The post was shared by a self-identified religious, conservative account, he says. “It was typical of other things I was seeing too — this guy didn’t understand how a single guy who did not have his own kids would choose to marry a woman who had her own kids already, and then choose to raise another man’s children,” Brake says. “There was this sort of ugly macho-ism, which, coming from a Christian background, was so antithetical to all the messages I always heard about how God adopts people into his family, about how we should adopt and love the orphan and those who don’t have parents.”

Brake has a strong relationship with his own stepfather, he says, and he approaches his stepchildren with the same depth of care and respect. When he married his wife, he says, his wedding vows included a promise to love her children as his own.

“You’re still concerned about their future. And if you think that someone having stepkids keeps them from caring about the future — that probably says more about you than it does about a stepparent,” he says. “It’s a politically gross thing to say. It’s disrespectful to every stepparent, to every parent who has adopted kids, to the people who can’t have children but nonetheless mentor and teach and take care of children — it’s disrespectful to all of those people.”

To Tomika Anderson Greene, who lives in Virginia with a blended family that includes her biological son and four stepchildren, the idea of dismissing a stepparent is ironic because their caregiving demands particular courage and commitment.

To become an adoptive parent or stepparent, she says, “is to step into a role that, in a lot of ways, is harder than the biological one. You’re starting at a place where the child is, not where they began, and you’re building a relationship with them from that place. You are challenged to shift and change and grow.”

Greene’s four stepchildren are adults, “but that applies to me, too,” she says. “We do family dinners; we start traditions we didn’t have before. It is a lot of good work.”

Like Harris and Blackstone, Greene generally avoids the term stepchildren: “I refer to them as my kids, or my bonus kids. And I’ve allowed those kids to define what my relationship is to them and followed their lead.”

When she saw the recent criticism of Harris, Greene says she felt a deep sense of recognition — and fury.

“This would not be levied at her if she was a man. It wouldn’t even be a point of consideration,” she says. “This smoke and mirrors and gaslighting that we’re seeing is par for the course when you’re a Black woman. I would laugh in the face of someone who dared to try to tell me what a real parent is and what it is not.”

Then she pauses, and does start to laugh. “I am excited to hopefully watch her just brush that right off and keep her focus,” she says. “Those are her kids. End of story.”

4b826d1984,The New York Times,Opinion | NATO Has to Change. Here’s How. - The New York Times,"What would Ike say now?

Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, NATO’s first supreme allied commander Europe, felt strongly that his mission was to get Europeans “back on their military feet” — not for American troops to become the permanent bodyguard for Brussels and Berlin.

“If in 10 years, all American troops stationed in Europe for national defense purposes have not been returned to the United States,” he wrote of NATO in 1951, “then this whole project will have failed.”

But as leaders of NATO allies gather in Washington on Tuesday for the alliance’s 75th anniversary, some 90,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Germany, Italy, Britain and elsewhere, making up a significant portion of the 500,000 NATO troops on high readiness.

America’s outsize presence comes not just in the form of troops. Of the $206 billion in military and nonmilitary aid allocated to Ukraine by countries around the world, $79 billion has come from the United States, according to the Ukraine Support Tracker database. Since about 1960, the United States’ share of allied G.D.P. has averaged roughly 36 percent, while its share of allied military spending has been more than 61 percent, according to a Cato Institute report. The supreme allied commander Europe has never been a European.

It is now becoming increasingly clear that Europeans need to shoulder more responsibility for their own defense. That’s not just because Donald Trump and an isolationist wing of the Republican Party complain bitterly about having to defend wealthy countries that, by the way, can afford social safety nets that America can only dream of because they don’t spend as much on their militaries. It’s also because U.S. officials are becoming more focused on the challenges posed by China, which will require an increasing amount of attention and resources in the years ahead, especially given the growing cooperation among China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.

The United States simply can’t do everything everywhere all at once, by itself. The future requires well-armed, capable allies. The indispensable nation has to be a bit less indispensable.

Regardless of who wins the U.S. election, European leaders understand that they need to contribute more, Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide of Norway told me. During his recent trip to Washington, he said Republicans relayed that Europeans have to take much more responsibility for the war in Ukraine because the United States has “bigger fish to fry.”

It’s starting to happen, but not nearly as quickly as it should. The NATO summit will no doubt celebrate the fact that 23 NATO members are expected to spend at least 2 percent of their G.D.P. on defense, up from just three members that met that threshold a decade ago. But it’s stunning that nearly a third of NATO’s 32 members still fell short of that spending goal, which was agreed upon in 2014. If Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Mr. Trump’s not-so-subtle threats to abandon freeloaders haven’t convinced them to pony up more for their own defense, it’s hard to imagine what will.

After all, European reliance on U.S. troops runs counter to what many Europeans and Americans say they want. Majorities in the United States, Britain, France and Germany believe Europe should be “primarily responsible for its own defense while aiming to preserve the NATO alliance,” according to a recent survey by the Institute for Global Affairs. Only 7 percent of German and 13 percent of French respondents felt that the United States should be primarily responsible for Europe’s defense.

Europe’s dependence on the United States is engendering growing unease on the continent. Finland’s former president Sauli Niinisto has called for a “more European NATO,” and President Emmanuel Macron of France has warned that “however strong our alliance with America is, we are not a priority for it.”

So why does this dependence persist?

Part of the reason is human nature. Why would allies invest in defense if Uncle Sam always picks up the tab? But another reason is structural. When NATO was created, European allies were just emerging from devastating wars that left them suspicious of — and even hostile to — one another. Somebody had to herd the cats.

That’s how the U.S. role in NATO changed from that of temporary helper to permanent protector. At first, NATO was like a policeman watching over a construction site; the alliance went hand in hand with the Marshall Plan. If Americans were going to help rebuild Europe, they had to make sure that Moscow didn’t steal their investment.

But by the 1960s, it had become obvious that U.S. troops wouldn’t be leaving anytime soon. The Soviet Union had swallowed up much of Eastern Europe, including the eastern part of Germany. That made West Germany key to stopping the Soviets, but few in Europe could stomach the idea of a strong German military after what had happened under the Nazis. So the Americans stayed put and protected Germany with their own troops and nuclear umbrella.

“The present system did not take shape because America had set out to become a kind of empire,” Marc Trachtenberg, a political scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has written extensively about the Cold War, told me. “The system came into being because U.S. leaders realized by 1961 that there could be no purely European solution to the European security problem.” The Americans, he said, were stuck in Europe.

Once Washington realized it couldn’t leave, it started calling the shots. “We are bound to pay the price of leadership,” McGeorge Bundy, President John F. Kennedy’s national security adviser, said in 1962. “We may as well have some of its advantages.”

That meant juicy defense contracts for American firms, which became a powerful financial incentive to keep a big footprint in Europe. It’s one reason Poland buys American tanks that are too heavy to cross Polish bridges and Romania buys fighter jets that are extremely expensive to operate and maintain. The U.S. military industrial complex profits from dependency. About 63 percent of the military equipment that European Union countries purchased in 2022-23 came from the United States.

At the end of the Cold War, Europeans tried to wean themselves off U.S. military might. In 1998, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and President Jacques Chirac of France attempted to create a European security system capable of acting on its own. But Secretary of State Madeleine Albright nipped that in the bud in a speech that warned against diminishing NATO’s role, duplicating NATO’s efforts and discriminating against NATO members that weren’t in the European Union.

In 2017, 23 European countries started the Permanent Structured Cooperation on Security and Defense to work together on practical projects such as cyberdefense. That, too, got a negative reaction from the Trump administration, which warned against excluding American firms.

It’s no wonder that today Europe lacks the capacity to deploy the soldiers and equipment that NATO needs to defend its members, especially when it comes to specialized units such as air defense, intelligence and surveillance. John R. Deni, the author of a new report on NATO readiness, told me that NATO planners routinely come up short when they seek contributions of sophisticated systems, partly because so much has already been sent to Ukraine. “There is just not enough to go around,” he said. “There are still troubling gaps.”

Luckily, some European leaders are treating this with the urgency it deserves. At the summit, NATO allies are expected to endorse a new defense industrial pledge to scale up the production of weapons and ammunition. But NATO’s procurement plan relies heavily on American arms makers. That clashes with the new European Defense Industrial Strategy, rolled out by the European Commission in March, which envisions spending half of its military procurement budget on items produced in Europe by 2030. Once again, cats need to be herded. There’s a dire need for both institutions to get on the same page.

If they do, it will be a great step forward for Europe’s ability to assist in its own defense. In the past, Americans might have sensed a threat to their authority and sabotaged this effort to build up a European defense industry. But today, Americans, who are also struggling to ramp up their own industrial defense production, need all the help they can get.

“A stronger Europe means a stronger NATO and ultimately a more equal partnership between the U.S. and Europe,” said Rachel Rizzo, nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Europe Center. “You want a peer relationship. You don’t want a client.”

Europeans are finally stepping up, as General Eisenhower dreamed they would. Let’s not stand in their way.

4d31dc7edc,Financial Times,Xi’s visit stress-tests Macron’s plans for a sovereign Europe - Financial Times,"Welcome to Trade Secrets. Last week Olaf Scholz was in Beijing; this week Xi Jinping is in the EU, stress-testing EU unity and particularly the Franco-German relationship. Today I’ll make a couple of observations on that score and then Thursday’s Trade Secrets column will look in detail at Brussels’ apparent new get-tough regime towards Chinese companies in Europe. The rest of today’s newsletter is an author Q&A on the new book by former Australian trade negotiator and Trade Secrets favourite Dmitry Grozoubinski, a rare exception to the rule that nothing interesting on trade ever comes out of Geneva. Charted Waters is on China’s currency.

Xi loves EU, yeah, yeah, yeah?

The dynamics around Xi Jinping’s visit to the EU aren’t exactly difficult to make out. It’s clear from Olaf Scholz’s muted rhetoric during his trip to China last month that Germany’s dependence on the Chinese market still restrains Berlin from regarding China as a full-on economic competitor, let alone a strategic rival.

Emmanuel Macron, whom Xi met yesterday, gives off a more combative air, and is trying to stop China from driving a wedge between France and Germany. The French president’s recent speech at the Sorbonne (here in translation) set out a strategy aiming to operationalise “strategic autonomy”, a concept the EU invented in 2020 and has been trying to define ever since, with much more interventionist trade and industrial policy to create European industries and actively to manage supply chains.

But though Macron’s vision sounds cohesive, it will struggle not just with Germany’s continued reliance on the Chinese market but a lack of trust elsewhere in the EU. For one, Macron has a history of lurching back and forth on China. It’s not just his notorious comments on Taiwan after his trip to China last year but also a sudden last-minute switch to support the doomed Comprehensive Agreement on Investment deal with Beijing in 2020, reportedly because some trade and investment goodies were dangled in front of France to get it to shift.

The immediate deliverable of yesterday’s Macron-Xi meeting was for China to hold off on retaliatory tariffs on cognac, another France-specific concession. (Meanwhile, Scholz’s trip to Beijing apparently won him some favours on German exports of beef, pork and apples: the Chinese approach to buying off trading partners’ discontent really isn’t subtle.)

This feeds the old suspicion, fair or not, that France’s EU-wide solutions reflect its own interests. It’s less a strategic vision of the EU car industry that caused France privately to push for the investigation into subsidies for electric vehicle imports than French carmakers suffering more than their German counterparts from Chinese competition.

One of France’s previous attempts to create a pan-EU industrial policy through a sovereignty fund essentially fizzled out, again partly because of a belief elsewhere in the EU that here was Paris wanting to bail out French companies again. Macron has identified pressing issues with an overarching analysis and proposed some solutions. But France unfortunately isn’t the best country to be pushing them, at least unless Macron can convince Scholz to embrace his vision as well.

Lying trade lies and the lying pols who tell them

Dmitry Grozoubinski’s “Why Politicians Lie About Trade” comes out in May. If you want a two-word review, it’s great. It describes official myths and distortions, from overselling trade deals to claiming distance no longer matters in trade to saying corporations control the world by infiltrating the WTO. To give you a flavour of the tone, corporate lobbyists’ occasional visits to a WTO meeting have “the bemused and mildly horrified ‘what’s all this then?’ air of an English constable arriving on the scene of an out of control food fight at the local clown college”.

AB You want the book to be “accessible hard work worth doing”. (Obviously a cynical play for the mass market.) Who most needs to know this stuff? Politicians themselves, journalists, businesses, voters?

DG My publisher’s preferred answer would be “every man, woman and child on planet Earth”, but that’s probably a touch ambitious. I wrote this book for people who have policy issues they care about, whether it’s climate change, job creation, national security or anything else. Trade and the decisions governments make about it impact all of these.

AB Brexit and Trump’s trade wars might be expensive ways to learn about trade, but have they oddly led to more appreciation of the issues?

DG Absolutely. One of the reasons trade has historically been so easy to lie about is how separated causes and effects are. You sign a free trade agreement today and 10 years from now you can look back and (if you squint) make some guesses about what it actually did.

Brexit and Trump’s trade wars, because they were about unpicking the existing order and potentially doing so very abruptly, forced all sorts of people to take these issues a lot more seriously and start asking far harder questions about what’s under the hood. There’s nothing like staring down the barrel of mile-long queues at the border and empty supermarket shelves to make everyone, from voters all the way up to prime ministers, ask a few follow-up questions.

AB You had a very interesting observation about economists being brought in only at the end of trade talks to make up some figures to justify the deal.

DG What I was trying to illustrate as gently as I could is that trade negotiations and trade policy are first and foremost about politics and power. In a fight between a policy the economic modelling says will have greater long-term GDP benefits, and a policy the political affairs folk say has the strong backing of a large and vocal interest group, my money is on the latter. Polish farmers aren’t being coddled on Ukrainian grain imports because some wonky IMF econometric analysis said so.

AB I remember talking to Doug Irwin once who said that Nafta boosters said it would create half a million jobs and Nafta bashers said it would destroy half a million jobs. In fact jobs-wise it was probably a wash. How much is overstatement on both sides a problem?

DG Overstatement is the greatest problem humanity has ever faced, or ever will. More seriously, yes I think it’s a problem that especially before the text is public, both supporters and detractors of a trade agreement can say literally anything about its impacts in an ultimately unfalsifiable way. A trade agreement could do just about anything.

More practically though, I think the challenge is that we focus on tools like trade agreements when we should be having a discussion about the problems we’re trying to solve. A trade agreement isn’t a goal in and of itself, any more than “surgery” is an objective.

AB I literally can’t think of a question to ask you about the WTO. Is that OK?

DG Probably not a great sign for the organisation, but absolutely fine by me!

AB If you had to advise governments to make a positive but honest case for more trade that they’re currently not making, what would you say?

DG I would say that tariffs are taxes on your own citizens for being insufficiently patriotic in their purchasing choices, and that feels like there should be a high bar to clear before we reach for them as a policy tool.

I would say that climate change requires us to pool the ingenuity, creativity and productivity of the entire world and we can’t afford to caveat our climate ambitions on all solar panels and electric vehicles being made exclusively in our swing electoral districts.

And I would say that people are smarter than the current level of discourse and can be trusted to understand trade-offs if they’re clearly and honestly explained.

3e30501c29,Financial Times,FirstFT: Harris’s economic plans under scrutiny against Democratic convention backdrop - Financial Times,"Good morning. Today we’re covering:

Iran’s attempts to sabotage the US presidential race

The US’s support for a UN-led treaty calling for reduced plastic production

Anticipated intervention by antitrust regulators in the 7-Eleven takeover attempt

But first, Kamala Harris’s plans for the US economy have come under fresh scrutiny by economists and business leaders, as this week’s Democratic National Convention sheds light on what an administration led by her would look like.

Proposals that have come under fire include her pledges to ratchet up the corporation tax rate from 21 to 28 per cent, impose a federal ban on price-gouging in the food sector and to offer more tax breaks for first-time homebuyers. Earlier this month, she also backed a plan to scrap taxes on tips — a policy lifted straight from Donald Trump’s agenda.

“This plan was obviously not designed to appeal to economists,” David Wessel, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution said. Others have called the plans populist and gimmicky, and worry about their market-distorting effects. However, some elements of the Harris plan, foremost boosting housing supply, have drawn praise, particularly as markets bet on interest rate cuts later in the year.

The common thread of the proposals is that each promises to address concerns expressed by the average voter, such as high inflation and the cost of raising children. And the doubts of policy analysts don’t appear to have damped the energy in Chicago, as thousands of rapturous fans anticipate former president Barack Obama’s speech today.

Opinion: The US economy is set for volatility, whoever wins the White House, the FT’s economics commentator Chris Giles writes.

4e5b6f2d96,CBS News,Supreme Court rejects challenge to Biden administration's contacts with social media companies - CBS News,"Washington — The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected a bid from a group of social media users and two states to curtail the Biden administration's efforts to pressure social media companies to remove content that officials said was misinformation.

The court determined that the users and the states, Louisiana and Missouri, did not have the legal right to seek an injunction against the Biden administration over its contacts with the platforms. The users had argued that their speech was unconstitutionally stifled when their social media posts were removed or suppressed after prodding by administration officials.

The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in the case known as Murthy v. Missouri, with Justice Amy Coney Barrett writing for the majority. She was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh and Ketanji Brown Jackson.

The decision by the high court reverses a lower court order that limited the contacts White House and administration officials could have with platforms, which the Justice Department had argued went too far. That injunction had been on hold while the Supreme Court considered the case.

""The plaintiffs rely on allegations of past government censorship as evidence that future censorship is likely,"" Barrett wrote. ""But they fail, by and large, to link their past social-media restrictions to the defendants' communications with the platforms. Thus, the events of the past do little to help any of the plaintiffs establish standing to seek an injunction to prevent future harms.""

In a dissent joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, Justice Samuel Alito called the case ""one of the most important free speech cases to reach this court in years,"" and accused government officials of coercing private entities — the social media companies — to suppress speech.

The trio of dissenters criticized the majority for sidestepping the free speech issues raised in the case and permitting ""the successful campaign of coercion ... to stand as an attractive model for future officials who want to control what the people say, hear and think.""

Murthy v. Missouri

The legal battle centered around the five social media users' claims that the Biden administration's communications with platforms violated their First Amendment rights. The challengers had accused federal officials of mounting a ""sprawling federal 'Censorship Enterprise,'"" through which they coerced social media companies into censoring or suppressing speech they disfavored.

The users and officials from Louisiana and Missouri urged the Supreme Court to limit how far the federal government can go in interactions with social media companies, arguing that the efforts from the Biden administration crossed the constitutional line from persuasion, which is allowed, to coercion, which is not.

The Supreme Court's ruling comes as the federal government prepares to combat misinformation online ahead of the November presidential election, while confronting sophisticated artificial intelligence tools that are more readily available to the public. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the ruling from the court helps to ensure that the Biden administration can continue its work with tech companies to protect the American people.

""This administration engages with social media and other technology companies on critical topics, including terrorism threats, foreign malign influence campaigns, online harassment of women and children, and mental health of children and adolescents,"" she said in a statement. ""The Supreme Court's decision today ensures this work can continue as the country faces ongoing threats online.""

Jean-Pierre said the White House continues to believe that while social media companies make independent decisions about the information presented on their platforms, they have a responsibility to take into account the effects their sites have on the public.

The case was one of several before the justices in its current term that stood at the intersection of social media and the First Amendment's free speech protections. In this dispute, a federal district judge in Louisiana sided with the social media users, finding that White House officials and some federal agencies and their employees violated the First Amendment by coercing or significantly encouraging social media companies' content-moderation decisions. The judge issued a sweeping order restricting the Biden administration's contacts with platforms.

A federal appeals court agreed that certain White House officials and the FBI unconstitutionally coerced platforms to suppress content related to COVID-19 vaccines and the 2020 election. But the court narrowed the scope of the district court judge's order to cover a smaller group of federal officials.

The Supreme Court in October agreed to take up the case and consider whether the Biden administration impermissibly worked to suppress speech on Facebook, YouTube and X. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch dissented from the court's decision to pause the lower court's injunction and said they would have maintained the limits on the Biden administration's contacts with platforms while the case proceeded.

The Biden administration had argued that they were using the bully pulpit to persuade platforms to address content it believed was problematic, especially in the context of its efforts to push Americans to get vaccinated during the pandemic. The administration warned that the limits put in place by the district court would hamper its ability to address national security threats or pass along public-health information.

Lawyers for the challengers, though, had claimed that the Biden administration was using social media companies to silence speakers and viewpoints and accused government officials of bullying the platforms.

Writing for the majority, Barrett said the 5th Circuit was wrong to affirm the district court's sweeping injunction. For some of the individual social media users whose content was targeted, she noted the social media restrictions began before Biden administration officials began discussions with the platforms.

""[W]ithout proof of an ongoing pressure campaign, it is entirely speculative that the platforms' future moderation decisions will be attributable, even in part, to the defendants,"" Barrett wrote.

The majority said that available evidence shows that the platforms have continued to enforce their policies against misinformation posted about COVID-19, even as the federal government ended the national emergency and unwound response measures.

""Enjoining the government defendants, therefore, is unlikely to affect the platforms' content-moderation decisions,"" the court said.

But Alito disagreed, and said it is ""reasonable to infer"" that the efforts of federal officials' impacted at least some of Facebook's content moderation decisions. Focusing specifically on Facebook and the targeting of Hines' posts, he called the Biden administration's efforts ""subtle and sophisticated,"" and said some high-ranking officials ""browbeat"" platforms for months.

Alito rejected the Justice Department's assertions that officials were using the bully pulpit to inform the public, and said its contention ""stretches the concept beyond breaking point.""

""In sum, the officials wielded potent authority. Their communications with Facebook were virtual demands. And Facebook's quavering responses to those demands show that it felt a strong need to yield,"" he said.

The dispute involving the Biden administration's contacts with social media companies was one of two the Supreme Court heard involving ""jawboning,"" or informal pressure by the government on an intermediary to take certain actions that will suppress speech.",A security guard stands in front of the Supreme Court building with a crane in the background and a clear blue sky above.,<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BDA732EC0>,2024-06-26 14:04:00+00:00,https://www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-biden-social-media-censorship-case/,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.8 ],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/4e5b6f2d96.png
8dc069cd00,ABC News,Trump's VP announcement will come by next Monday: Adviser - ABC News,"Former President Donald Trump's long-awaited announcement on who his vice presidential pick will be could likely happen this week, senior adviser Jason Miller said on Monday.

""By this time next Monday, we will know who President Trump has selected as his running mate for the 2024 election,"" Miller said during a Monday appearance on Fox & Friends.

""It could happen any time this week. Could happen literally right up until the first day of the convention,"" he added, referencing the Republican National Convention, which kicks off next Monday.

He then waded into speculation that the Democratic ticket of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris wouldn't be the ultimate Democratic ticket for November following calls for Biden to withdraw from the top of the ticket following the president's debate performance. In an exclusive interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos, Biden brushed off the poor performance as a ""bad episode.""

Though Miller wouldn't delve into specifics about Trump's list of potential vice presidential picks, he did contend that the former president has discussed potential running mates other than Sens. Marco Rubio and J.D. Vance and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.

While campaigning in Philadelphia last month ahead of his debate with Biden, Trump claimed ""in [his] mind"" he had decided who his running mate would be.

Trump has long said he planned to make his announcement either at or right before next week's RNC in Milwaukee.

""Right around the convention, maybe a little before,"" he said while campaigning late last month.

The campaign has already begun solidifying preparations for Trump's running mate. A plane for the future Republican vice presidential nominee is already parked in an airport hanger, sources told ABC News; Trump's pick is already scheduled to be at a fundraiser next week in Milwaukee during the RNC, according to an invitation confirmed by ABC News.

However, campaign officials still maintain they don't know who Trump's final selection will be, and some of the people reported to be on his shortlist also claim not to have much information.

Vance said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday that he hasn't received a call from Trump asking to be his running mate. He said he is focusing on campaigning for Trump at the moment.

""I have not gotten the call, Kristen, and I'll certainly -- you know, maybe not the first person that I let know if that happened, but we'll let the media know if I ever get that call,"" Vance said. ""But most importantly, Kristen, we're just trying to work to elect Donald Trump.""

Rubio also said he has ""heard nothing"" about joining Trump's ticket.

""I heard nothing. I know nothing; you probably know more than I do about it. Donald Trump has a decision to make. He'll make it when he needs to make it. He'll make a good decision,"" said Rubio during an appearance on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday.

Trump and his campaign have seemingly enjoyed playing the waiting game on this announcement, offering them an opportunity to garner swirling media attention as well as a host of enthusiastic surrogates trying to break through to the No. 2 spot.

As time dwindles down for Trump's choice to eventually be made public, he and his campaign say they'll have to be ready to go.

2c070dccc4,CNN,"A look at Alpha Kappa Alpha, the legendary sorority repped by Kamala Harris - CNN","As long as she’s been on the political scene, Vice President and likely Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has proudly repped the salmon pink and apple green of Alpha Kappa Alpha, Sorority, Inc.

Alpha Kappa Alpha is a historic African American sorority, founded on the campus of Howard University, Harris’ alma mater. It was the first Black sorority of its kind, and is a part of the “Divine Nine,” a group of Black Pan-Hellenic organizations.

Members of Alpha Kappa Alpha and other groups in the Divine Nine have already rallied to support Harris’ bid for the presidency, networking and organizing to raise millions upon millions of dollars for her campaign. Harris is also a frequent presence at high-profile events, including Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.’s biennial convention earlier this month.

The sorority has been a critical source of support and sisterhood not just for Harris, but for the 360,000 some women across the US and the world that make up its ranks. AKA members are political leaders, civil rights activists, literary icons and scientists, and the sorority’s cultural impact has deep, wide-reaching roots.

“When you become a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, you become a member for life,” Danette Anthony Reed, international president and CEO of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. told CNN.

Here’s a look at the history of Alpha Kappa Alpha and how it become a force in American society.

AKA was founded by Black women at Howard University

Alpha Kappa Alpha, or AKA as it’s familiarly known, was founded more than a century ago with the aim of connecting and empowering Black college-educated women. In the years since, AKA has been a springboard for its members to achieve academic and professional success, as well as leadership development and personal growth. The organization has also facilitated numerous community service initiatives across the country.

Groups like Alpha Kappa Alpha were a natural evolution of Greek life on college campuses. The first fraternities and sororities in the US formed in the late 1700s and 1800s as forums where college students could discuss current events and literature outside their strict curriculums, according to Lawrence Ross, author of “The Divine Nine: The History of African American Fraternities and Sororities.”

Greek life at predominantly White institutions eventually expanded and evolved into social clubs, but it excluded students of color. In the early 1900s, at a time of intense racial segregation and disenfranchisement, African American students at White institutions and historically Black colleges and universities founded the Greek letter organizations that make up the Divine Nine with an additional mission: To uplift each other and all Black people.

“It’s very much centered upon not just the college experience, but the notion that those of us who get college educations have a responsibility — not just to our own selves or our own transformation, but the transformation of our communities,” Ross, a member of the historically Black Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. said.

On January 15, 1908, Ethel Hedgemon — along with Anna Easter Brown, Beulah Burke, Lillie Burke, Marjorie Hill, Margaret Flagg Holmes, Lavinia Norman, Lucy Diggs Slowe and Marie Woolfolk — founded Alpha Kappa Alpha at Howard University as a community of women with shared values and goals. They chose an ivy leaf as their symbol, drafted a constitution and extended invitations to a group of sophomores on campus.

It was the first Black sorority in the country.

“We weren’t allowed to vote. We weren’t allowed to hold certain positions,” Evelyn Sample-Oates, a former international regional director of Alpha Kappa Alpha and a longtime member, told CNN. “These are women that came together because they had the like-minded agenda to gather strong Black women so that we could make a difference.”

To ensure the longevity of Alpha Kappa Alpha, Nellie Quander, along with Norma Boyd and Minnie Smith, led the effort to incorporate the organization in 1913. Over the next decade, AKA grew in strength and numbers — it established new chapters at campuses across the country, held its first Boule and began publishing an official journal called The Ivy Leaf.

How AKA became a cultural force

As Alpha Kappa Alpha transformed into a national organization over the first half of the 20th century, its members looked to more ambitious goals.

In 1913, Quander wrote to women’s rights activist Alice Paul, imploring her to include Black students from Howard in a women’s suffrage march without discrimination.

Then in 1921, Alpha Kappa Alpha sent a telegram to President Warren G. Harding, urging the administration to back a bill that would have made lynching a federal crime, according to AKA’s website.

One of Alpha Kappa Alpha’s most significant and well-known initiatives was the Mississippi Health Project, which was launched during the Great Depression.

From 1935 to 1942, AKA volunteers — led by President Ida Jackson and member Dr. Dorothy Ferebee — traveled to the Mississippi Delta and set up mobile health clinics for rural Black families who lacked access to health care. AKA compiled its observations into a report and elevated it to first lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who became a champion of many AKA initiatives and eventually an honorary member, according to the documentary “Twenty Pearls: The Story of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority.”

Over the years, Alpha Kappa Alpha and its members took on a more prominent role in the fight for social justice.

In 1938, Boyd, an educator and one of AKA’s earliest members, founded a congressional lobbying group to push legislation on issues concerning Black Americans. And in 1939, Alpha Kappa Alpha joined the NAACP as a lifetime member, paving the way for other historically Black fraternities and sororities to formally join in the fight for civil rights.

Another hallmark initiative came in 1965 with the Cleveland Job Corps. For 30 years, Alpha Kappa Alpha operated a federal job training center, equipping numerous Black women with the skills and education needed to place them in jobs.

Today, Alpha Kappa Alpha carries on this legacy of service, awarding millions of dollars in scholarships and grants, fighting food insecurity and building up the next generation of Black leaders, Reed said.

“Whether it’s social activism, advocacy for civil rights, building economic wealth, impacting our communities, we make a positive change,” she added. “And we empower individuals to strive for excellence.”

Its ranks are filled with luminaries

For all of its accomplishments as an organization, perhaps the most enduring legacy of Alpha Kappa Alpha is the individual contributions and achievements of its members.

Women of Alpha Kappa Alpha have populated the highest ranks of their fields, whether in politics, law, literature or science.

Constance Baker Motley was the first female attorney for the Legal Defense Fund and wrote the original complaint in Brown v. Board of Education. The late Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a leading champion of Black American issues in Congress, was an AKA, as was Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison.

Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson — three Black mathematicians who worked for NASA in the 1950s and were at the center of the film “Hidden Figures” — also were Alpha Kappa Alphas. NASA astronaut Mae Jemison, the first African American woman in space, repped the pink and green, too.

Many more women were initiated into Alpha Kappa Alpha as honorary members, including civil rights icon Rosa Parks, jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald and director Ava DuVernay.

AKA continues to build power among Black women

With the ascension of Vice President Harris, Alpha Kappa Alpha is once again in the spotlight, and its political and cultural power is on full display from flashes of pink and green among Harris supporters to endorsements from fellow AKAs in politics.

“I am 1908% in with you Madam Soror Vice-President!!!!,” Florida Representative Ashley Gantt posted on X after President Joe Biden announced his endorsement of Harris.

AKA is a nonpartisan organization, but like every Greek organization, its members are often politically active. CNN’s Fredreka Schouten reported that Harris’ campaign saw more than 1,500 contributions of exactly $19.08 between Sunday afternoon — when Biden exited the presidential race — and Monday evening, nodding to AKA’s founding in 1908.

Sample-Oates said Harris’ campaign — and the support her sorors have shown her — are a testament to the sisterhood of AKA and what Black women can achieve when they link arms. It’s part of what inspired her to join the sorority about 40 years ago at American University.

“We’ve got a tough role out here in society,” she said. “We’re often underestimated, undervalued, underpaid, and it’s important that we come together and bond on these issues so together we can rise up.”","A woman stands behind a podium with the Presidential Seal, gesturing with her hands, in front of a backdrop with the text 'Elevating Our Legacy of Service &' visible.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BCBF4CA00>,2024-07-25 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/us/aka-alpha-kappa-alpha-kamala-harris-cec/index.html,['Politics' 'Other'],[0.85 0.75],Unlikely,Likely,sample_review/images/2c070dccc4.png

New York’s lead in the American League East over Baltimore was trimmed to a half-game.

Walker hit a long two-run homer in the fifth and drove in three runs. Walker had the first five-hit game by a Cardinal since teammate Matt Carpenter in 2018 after going 1 for 8 in his first two games following his recall from Triple-A Memphis.

At 22 years, 102 days, the former first-round pick became the third-youngest Cardinal to get five hits in a game, trailing Frank Snyder (21 years, 86 days on Sept. 21, 1915) and Rogers Hornsby (20 years, 62 days on June 28, 2016).

“I think five-hit days are sick,” Walker said. “It’s very nice to have for sure but I’m always confident in my abilities. But it’s definitely nice.”

Afterwards, Walker had a signed baseball to celebrate the occasion from pitcher Kyle Gibson, the home run ball and a signed scorecard from St. Louis television play-by-play broadcaster Chip Caray.

“It’s good to see him out there and just doing what he did today,” St. Louis manager Oliver Marmol said about Walker. “Obviously he’s not going to five knocks every day, but he stayed on the ball extremely well and just looks like he’s having fun out there.”

Nootbaar followed Walker’s fourth hit by lifting a fly ball to right field. New York’s Juan Soto appeared to struggle getting a read on the ball and it went over his head as the Cardinals took a 10-7 lead .

“I didn’t know, I was hoping here with the shorter right field that maybe it could distract him or something,” Nootbaar said of Soto’s read. “I was just hoping for anything at that point.”

“He just hit a line drive, it got good backspin and it just went over my head,” Soto said.

Nootbaar set a career high with five RBIs and had his fourth hit to give the Cardinals a lead in the seventh or later this season.

Victor Scott II hit an RBI double and scored on a throwing error by reliever Phil Bickford as the Cardinals set season highs for runs and hits (21) and were 8 for 18 with runners in scoring position.

St. Louis had double-digit hits for the sixth time and seven games and finished with at least 20 hits for the first time since totaling 23 at Cincinnati Sept. 1, 2020.

Nootbaar blasted his ninth homer after Walker opened the ninth with his fourth single.

Anthony Rizzo hit an RBI double to start a three-run fifth ahead of run-scoring singles by Alex Verdugo and Gleyber Torres.

536f014e27,New York Post,Exclusive | New Yorkers rated as most dishonest among online daters in the US - New York Post,"It’s a world wide web of lies when it comes to dating in New York.

The Empire State ranked as the worst in the nation in a survey rating honesty among online daters — scoring 3.4 out of 10, below the national average of 5.1.

DatingAdvice.com surveyed 3,000 singles on the truthfulness of those they matched with via dating apps, ranking the accuracy of information such as age, job and real-life appearances listed on profiles on a scale of 1 to 10.

Cameron Aragon of Hell’s Kitchen once matched with a man on Hinge who appeared to have an athletic build in his photos, but when she arrived for their first date, she didn’t even recognize him.

“He put this persona on that he lived an athletic life and had a shirtless picture with a little bit of abs going on, but he was unfit,” she told The Post.

“I couldn’t get out of the Uber. I was in shock … this person in front of me was unrecognizable. It felt like I was being catfished.”

The man, who worked in finance and lived in FiDi, even admitted other women had given him the same feedback.

“When I called him out for it, he was like, ‘Yeah, I know, I’ve been told this before. Those pictures are a little old,'” recalled Aragon, 25, an actress who hails from California.

“I probably would have gone out with him if he accurately presented himself. But I was uncomfortable just because I was like, ‘I don’t know what else he’s lying about.'”

Big Apple guys lie the most about where they live, pretending they reside in pricier neighborhoods, Aragon noted.

“They’ll say they live in Manhattan, but they’re actually in Hoboken, or they say Williamsburg, but they’re in Bushwick,” said Aragon.

“A really popular one is guys love to say they live in Gramercy Park, but they live in Kips Bay or the East Village.”

Singles taking the survey also weighed in on the specific things they found dating app users lied the most about.

Relationship status came in first at 32%, meaning many users are finding that their matches aren’t actually single.

“Unfortunately, most people I know have encountered somebody who’s on a dating site, who’s already in a relationship,” said Brooklyn-based online dating coach Erika Ettin.

“People get bored in their relationships. They want to feel attractive. They want to feel like there’s still options.”

Age came in second at 30%, and real-life appearances landed in third, at 22%.

Employment, education and age are also prime lying zones.

New Jersey and Connecticut daters were nearly as dishonest as New York, with scores of 4.1 and 4.9, respectively.

South Dakotans were the most honest in the country, with a score of 7.5.

Comedian Maximillian Lowe, who also lives in Hell’s Kitchen, said it’s not hard to see why New Yorkers took home the most deceitful crown.

“Because we already lie to ourselves so much, so lying to other people comes naturally to us. We lie to ourselves that this city doesn’t smell like s–t, we pretend that the bus is gonna be on time, or that we can afford that new apartment,” said Lowe, 27.

“Lying about my height on Tinder is exactly the same as pretending that you have a limp so that you can get a seat on the subway. That’s just survival of the fittest, and sometimes you gotta bring that same attitude to the dating game.”","A woman sits at a table with a smartphone displaying the Hinge app, which is being used to illustrate the headline about New Yorkers being rated as the most dishonest among online daters in the US.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BC78E5E70>,2024-08-10 00:00:00+00:00,https://nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2024/08/10/us-news/new-yorkers-rated-as-most-dishonest-among-online-daters-in-the-us/,['Local/Regional' 'Entertainment'],[0.85 0.75],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/536f014e27.png
0a9fe16819,The Globe and Mail,"The close: Stocks sharply lower as anxiety rises, earnings heat up - The Globe and Mail","U.S. stocks tumbled on Thursday, reversing early gains as investors continued to rotate away from high-priced megacap growth stocks and second-quarter earnings season gathered steam.

All three major U.S. stock indexes suffered losses, and the blue-chip Dow fell the most, halting a series of consecutive record closing highs. The Canadian benchmark stock index also closed lower for the second day in a row, pressured by declines in technology and metal mining shares.

The sell-off resumed a day after the Nasdaq posted its biggest one-day drop since December 2022 and the chip sector suffered its largest daily percentage plunge since the pandemic-related shutdown panic of March 2020.

But anxiety remained elevated. The CBOE Market Volatility index, often called the “fear index,” touched its highest level since early May.

“What’s different from [Wednesday] is you did see money going into other sectors ... but today it’s a pretty broad selloff,” said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York.

The Russell 2000 fell for the second day in a row after an apparent rotation into smallcaps sent the index soaring 11.5% in its most robust five-day gain since April 2020.

“Over the last two weeks we’ve seen a rotation into other sectors including midcaps and smallcaps, which have been huge laggards,” Ghriskey added. “But today it’s reversing. The market is flailing around trying to find a direction.”

“Investors (are) just pulling back and saying ‘we’re going to cash out now, it’s been a great run.’ They’re unsure what’s going to happen in terms of politics,” Ghriskey said.

In economic news, U.S. initial jobless claims data landed above analysts’ estimates, providing further evidence that the labor market is softening. This is a necessary step toward putting inflation on a sustainable downward path, according to the U.S. Federal Reserve.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 533.06 points, or 1.29%, to 40,665.02, the S&P 500 lost 43.68 points, or 0.78%, to 5,544.59 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 125.70 points, or 0.7%, to 17,871.22.

The S&P/TSX composite index ended down 124.41 points, or 0.5%, at 22,726.76. It posted an all-time high on Tuesday.

“I don’t think there is any specific catalyst,” said Barry Schwartz, chief investment officer at Baskin Wealth Management. “We’ve had a hell of a run up and this is just the pause that refreshes.”

“The elements are still in place for multi-year strong returns on markets. Inflation has been tamed, interest rates I’m certain are going to be cut globally in the next few months or so ... it’s just we got pretty spicy in terms of valuations for a lot of companies,” Schwartz said.

The TSX materials group, which includes metal miners and fertilizer companies, lost 2% as the prices of gold and copper fell, with the latter tumbling to a three-month low. Technology was down 1.1% and consumer discretionary ended 1.4% lower.

In the U.S., of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, health-care stocks suffered the largest percentage decline, while energy stocks were the sole gainers.

Domino’s Pizza tumbled 13.6% after falling short of estimates for quarterly same-store sales.

Homebuilder D.R. Horton beat profit estimates and delivered more new homes than expected, but tightened its annual forecast. Its shares jumped 10.1%.

The move also lifted the Philadelphia SE Housing index to a record high.

Warner Bros Discovery jumped 2.4% following a report that the company had discussed a plan to split its digital streaming and studio businesses from its legacy TV networks.

Streaming pioneer Netflix lost ground in extended trading after posting quarterly results.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.43-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.49-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 76 new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 160 new highs and 56 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.14 billion shares, compared with the 11.8-billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

1ec1f3428a,CNN,Congressmen demand answers after CNN report contradicts Pentagon investigations into deadly Kabul airport attack - CNN,"Nine Republican members of Congress have written to US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin urging him to explain discrepancies between CNN reporting last month about the ISIS-K attack that led to the deaths of 13 US servicemen and 170 Afghans outside Kabul airport in August 2021, and the conclusions of two Pentagon investigations into the incident.

The CNN report revealed that there were many more episodes of gunfire than the Pentagon has ever admitted, in the wake of the suicide attack in the final days of the American evacuation of Kabul. The reporting included a video obtained by CNN captured by a Marine’s GoPro camera that had not been seen publicly in full before.

The letter was sent on Tuesday by congressmen on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and presented a series of pointed questions for the Pentagon about its investigations into what was the deadliest incident in Afghanistan for decades – a brutal, bloody end point to America’s longest war. The eight congressmen, five of whom are veterans with experience in Afghanistan, urged Austin “in the strongest possible terms to account for the discrepancy between the results of the (US Central Command) CENTCOM investigation and this new reporting,” by CNN.

Much of the controversy about the Pentagon’s two investigations into the attack has focused on gunfire in the aftermath of the blast. Some Marines have told military investigators they felt they were being shot at or opened fire themselves, and 19 Afghan survivors told CNN in 2022 they were shot themselves or witnessed Afghans being shot. But the two Pentagon investigations – released in February 2022 and last month – concluded the only shooting in the aftermath came from US and UK troops in three bursts that were “nearly simultaneous,” and hit no one.

In their letter, the members of Congress said it is “unclear what generated this CENTCOM data point of near-simultaneous gunfire” in three bursts, which is “directly contradicted by the video footage obtained by CNN, which shows 11 episodes of gunfire over nearly four minutes.” They added that, after CNN published the GoPro footage, the Pentagon assured the House Foreign Affairs Committee that it had not seen the video prior to publication, but that the video did not contradict the findings of their investigations.

“While we appreciate CENTCOM’s investigation into the Abbey Gate attack, nearly three years later we still have the same questions that the very US servicemembers captured in the CNN video had, including who was firing the rounds and whether it was the Taliban or another hostile force. We therefore ask you to clarify the volume, incidence, and sources of gunfire at the scene,” the members of Congress wrote.

The Congressmen – Mike Waltz, Darrell Issa, Tim Burchett, Brian Mast, Rich McCormick, Keith Self, Cory Mills and Chris Smith – requested further action by investigators. The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs committee, Rep. Michael McCaul, was added to the letter Wednesday, his office confirmed.

CNN’s most recent report included an interview with the former head of a major Kabul hospital, Dr. Sayed Ahmadi, who said he and his staff had pulled bullets out of patients from the incident and that over 70 of the dead at their hospital had gunshot wounds. The letter asks why the Pentagon’s investigators did not speak to Dr. Ahmadi, or any other Afghans. The Pentagon has said all reports of gunshot wounds are mistaken, and that witnesses who recall extensive shooting – either at Marines or Afghan civilians – are suffering from the effects of blast concussion, or Traumatic Brain Injury.

“Lastly, why do journalists have this video footage and the Department does not? Is there any more footage in the Department’s possession that has not yet been made public? If so, please release such footage immediately and confirm that no more video recordings exist of which the Department is aware,” they added. “The truth must come out.”

The Office of the Secretary of Defense told CNN in a statement that, as with all congressional correspondence, it would respond directly to the members who wrote the letter. “We honor the service and sacrifice of our thirteen service members who were killed at Abbey Gate and remain fully committed to ensuring our Gold Star families have the support and information they need. This will always be a sacred obligation for the Department of Defense,” James Adams, a department spokesman, said.

Parents accuse Pentagon of being misleading

Growing Congressional scrutiny of the attack comes as the parents of seven Marines who died in the incident – Jared Schmitz, Humberto Sanchez, Taylor Hoover, Nicole Gee, Kareem Nikoui, Hunter Lopez and Rylee McCollum – accused the Pentagon of misleading them.

“As parents, we have always had the suspicion that we were not told the entire truth of how our children were murdered at the Abbey Gate on 8/26/21. The recent discovery of new video released by CNN directly contradicts and exposes outright lies from our recent briefing last month from CENTCOM officials,” the Gold Star families said in a statement they sent to CNN.

“We are consumed with anger at the betrayal from the Biden Administration. This is only the beginning for us to expose the cover up that has and is still taking place. The Biden Administration wants us to go away silently, but we will not!” they added.

The new CENTCOM commander, Gen. Erik Kurilla, ordered in September last year a supplemental review of the military’s 2022 investigation into the incident, and the families of dead servicemen were briefed last month on its results. Its focus was mainly whether the ISIS-K suicide bomber could have been stopped and determined the attack “could not have been preventable at the tactical level.” The families have long maintained more could have been done to stop the ISIS-K suicide bomber.

The letter and statement emerged as CENTCOM released over a thousand pages of witness accounts and evidence from the supplemental review. The 1,214 pages offer a variety of accounts of the aftermath of the blast, some of which appear to support the supplemental review’s conclusions. Yet others contain previously unseen witness testimony of gunfire in the aftermath which appears to jar with the two investigations’ conclusions.

Two apparent Marine accounts of the blast aftermath provide similar descriptions of a US personnel member being calmed down as he tried to load a .50-caliber heavy machine gun in a sniper tower that overlooked the blast site, and then apparently not firing the weapon. Names of the US personnel were redacted.

One of the service members recalled: “The Marines on the ground were shooting towards the blast location. But I didn’t see anyone shoot at us.” He added the gunfire continued for “probably a few minutes,” and then he recalled hearing: “some Gy Sgt [Gunnery Sergeant] yelled up to the tower saying we were taking small arms fire and find them and f**king kill them. I’m not sure of his name.”

Another eyewitness said he was inside the sniper tower above the blast site when two rounds hit the window in front of him and a third round narrowly missed him.

The evidence also suggests the Pentagon may have more video footage than it has acknowledged in public. A service member tells the review there were nine drones operational over the airport in the immediate aftermath of the blast, and that he watched feed from these drones for three hours.

The Pentagon has released five edited minutes of footage from the aftermath. The account also says “ISR” – likely a surveillance camera – was available at the scene shortly after the blast. Not all of this footage has been released. In another account, a Marine appears to hand over a GoPro to the supplemental review team.

Army Lt. Col. Rob Lodewick, public affairs adviser to the supplemental review team, said the two investigations had maintained their “utmost focus” on a “transparent, exhaustive and conclusive accounting” to the families of the dead US personnel, US military and public. “Any accusations of a deliberate attempt [by military officials] to mislead or deceive remain categorically false.”

Yet he added investigators “recognize the potential for new information to emerge over time” and that CENTCOM “welcome any additional information and imagery available to help ensure a comprehensive understanding of the attack on Abbey Gate from as many perspectives as possible.”

Lodewick noted the review team compiled 4,000 pages of evidence and “considered the totality of the information, provided by over 190 interviews, when concluding there was no complex attack.” He added all “imagery, including voluntarily provided personal GoPro footage, was thoroughly examined” and handled in “accordance with DoD and Service policies.”","An aerial view of a damaged building with debris scattered around, a white vehicle in the foreground, and a few people in the background, with a clear sky above.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6B7F2DAAA0>,2024-05-08 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/08/asia/congressmen-letter-cnn-report-kabul-attack-intl/index.html,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/1ec1f3428a.png
00a40596cd,ABC News,This Florida county is struggling with inflation and housing costs. Voters don't trust either party to fix it. - ABC News,"Rebecca Esche has lived in Jacksonville, Florida, for most of her life. She is active in her community, getting hooked on the local political scene by ""rabble rousing"" and engaging with local lawmakers about the state of the city's public parks on social media. The 35-year-old artist, homemaker and mother of a first grader is passionate about issues like LGBTQ+ rights and combating climate change.

But while she's an involved citizen and a committed voter, she's not excited about voting this year. ""I will hold my nose,"" she said. ""This is probably the one that hurts. It hurts the most so far … This one, I'm not stoked on it.""

And while Esche plans to vote for President Joe Biden, she knows plenty of other people who probably won't bother to vote at all this year. The primary concern she and some of her friends have about this year's presidential contest isn't even about the issues, she says; it's that both major-party candidates — including Biden, who she believes is fundamentally a ""good guy"" — are out of touch with the everyday economic realities at the top of voters' minds.

This is a common attitude in competitive Duval County, which is coterminous with Jacksonville. Former President Donald Trump narrowly won the county in 2016 before it flipped to Biden in 2020, 51 percent to 47 percent — the first time the county had voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter in 1976. But if voters were looking for a change, they may not feel that change has come.

In an election year in which voters nationwide are particularly unenthused about the state of the country, and about a 2020 rematch between unpopular candidates, local economic and political tensions only seem to amplify their doldrums. The Jacksonville community has experienced steep increases in housing prices and cost of living over the past five years, and many voters say they aren't hearing a compelling message on these issues from either side.

The Jacksonville voters we spoke to feel that politics has become as much about culture wars as it has about issues like economic policy. ""I've never seen a time when politicians run on things that aren't really related to issues; they're running on slogans … running on how to make the other person look so bad,"" said Matt Carlucci, a moderate Republican and insurance agent who sits on the city council.

""I think 60 percent of the country is looking for answers to real issues,"" he added, but he lamented that those issues, like the high cost of living, aren't being addressed by politicians on either side of the aisle, as intense partisanship has resulted in a war between two political fringes. ""The middle doesn't have a chance to be heard, because they're too busy taking their kids to school, going to work, paying their taxes, going to church, coaching their kids' Little League, doing things that regular, normal, productive citizens do.""

In that sense, Esche represents a typical Jacksonville voter this year: someone who is disappointed by the state of politics and who knows the direction she wants the country to go in but is not animated by the choices before her. A major question going into the election is just how many voters like her will also ""hold their noses"" and show up to the polls — and how many will just stay home.

""It'll come down to turnout — how many Democrats turn out, how many Republicans turn out — and a lot of that has to do with the excitement behind the candidate,"" Carlucci said. ""And with the candidates we have now… [they] will have to do everything they can to turn out their base,"" he said, shaking his head dispiritedly.

Located in Northeast Florida, Jacksonville is one of the largest cities in the country by land area and has a much more Southern feel than many other Florida cities. The Caribbean-inspired pastels typical in much of the state give way here to a streetscape with a more columned, stately brick vibe.

Like most of the rest of the country, and especially the South, Florida underwent a profound political transformation in the past half century, as rural areas became more solidly Republican and bigger cities became more Democratic. And as is true for other states, which column Florida falls into often comes down to turnout in swingy and populous urban and suburban areas, like Duval County.

In recent presidential cycles, Florida has shifted from being a pivotal swing state — it decided the 2000 election — to being redder at both the state and national levels. Jacksonville bucked the trend by shifting to Biden four years ago and electing a Democratic mayor last year. The split between a Democratic mayor and Republican city council has prompted some of the ""culture war"" conflicts that Jacksonville residents on both sides of the aisle pointed to as a distraction.

Demographics likely play a role here: The city is in some ways a microcosm of the United States. Unlike many other big cities in the state, where Latinos are the largest or second-largest racial or ethnic group, Jacksonville, which has just about 1 million residents, is about half white, 30 percent Black, 11 percent Latino and 5 percent Asian American; there is also a small Arab American population that the U.S. Census Bureau counts as white and has a long history in the region.

As larger Latino populations in South Florida have flocked to the Republican Party, eating away at Democrats' advantage in other cities, Jacksonville's demographics could help it move in the opposite direction.

""What's made Duval County sort of this epic battleground county in America is really [that] it's a voter-registration war,"" said Dean Black, a state representative and chair of the Duval County Republican Party. He noted that more voters in the county are registered to vote as Democrats than as Republicans, but Republicans have been working to catch up and strengthen their get-out-the-vote operation.

Black particularly emphasized his party's economic message, saying increased cost of living is a main topic of conversation for voters in Duval County and arguing that ""inflationary policies"" and government spending under the Biden administration are the main cause. (Economists say the reasons behind inflation are more complicated: After the COVID-19 pandemic, supply-chain issues, a tightening labor market and energy price increases spurred in part by the war in Ukraine all contributed to rising prices.)

Whatever the cause, the residents of Jacksonville certainly have pressing economic concerns. Among them is whether they can afford to continue living in their city at all.

Over the past few years, rents and home prices in Jacksonville have shot up. Rent.com found that rents in the city rose by 8.2 percent last year. Home prices, too, have risen sharply. The average home price in February 2020, right before the pandemic, was just over $198,820, according to Zillow; this June, it was $302,349.

Both of these metrics were driven in part by the fact that Florida remains a top destination state for movers. Plus, unlike cities farther south that tend to attract retirees, Jacksonville has recently attracted many younger families and those newly able to work from home. The city is affordable compared with areas with similar populations like Westchester County, New York, where home prices also shot up and currently sit at $787,186, or San Francisco, where prices have been declining but are still almost $1.3 million.

Corporations got in on the buying spree too. Jacquelyn Harris, a long-time Jacksonville resident who joined a local advocacy group because of housing affordability issues, said her monthly rent went up drastically during the pandemic: from $700 to almost $1,200 in two years. She blamed rent increases on corporations buying up properties and raising rents. ""They were like buzzards,"" she said.

Experts say she's right. David Jaffee, a sociologist at the University of North Florida, started a program to investigate and identify the reasons for increased rental prices in Jacksonville, and he's found that corporate ownership of rental properties plays a much larger role in increased prices than traditional models account for. Because housing is a basic need, he said, families are not always in a position to look for and demand lower prices.

""People need shelter, they need a home, they have families, they have kids, and so they're going to take what they can find … [but] it's going to impact the ability to pay for all the other necessities of life,"" Jaffee said. ""At some point, it's going to be unbearable, they're going to have to move, they're gonna get evicted."" Indeed, in 2022, Jacksonville had the highest eviction rate of any major metropolitan area in Florida, a study from UNF found, with a monthly average of 7.08 evictions for every 1,000 renters.

Esche started to notice problems with her budget a year ago. She said her family switched the grocery store they went to and started eating out less to save money. ""Parents aren't having birthday parties for their kids as much as last year,"" she said. ""You can feel it. I mean, there's a girl in my daughter's class who turned to her and said, 'I wish I had strawberries. My mommy said they're too expensive.'""

Esche knows many neighbors who are thinking about leaving Jacksonville. ""There is a mass exodus,"" she said. ""People can't afford insurance. They can't afford food, they can't afford the things that they want to do entertainmentwise, because all of the prices have climbed so high."" It was only through a devastating loss — the death of her father, who raised her as a single dad and left her a small sum of money — that she and her husband were able to buy a home in the Murray Hill neighborhood of Jacksonville five years ago. Today, Esche doesn't think they'd be able to afford a house in her home city.

Both parties have their own proposals to address these issues. Biden touched on the cost of housing in his State of the Union address and has promoted a plan that would give first-time homebuyers a tax credit of up to $10,000, among other proposals, while Republicans, including Trump, have focused on reducing mortgage interest rates. But while Americans' pessimism about the economy has eased a bit in recent months as economic indicators show a growing economy that is doing well on many measures, voters still aren't wild about the way Biden has handled it. In April, only 38 percent of Americans said they had a ""great deal"" or ""fair amount"" of confidence in Biden to do the right thing for the economy, according to Gallup.

Part of this comes down to the fact that Americans are thinking about the economy differently after the pandemic: Issues like high housing prices and costs for necessities in particular have left most Americans feeling gloomy, and they remain very concerned about inflation, even as it's slowed significantly. It's no surprise that these concerns are exacerbated in places like Jacksonville, given that inflated housing costs are a big part of why prices are still rising, and in Florida broadly, which still has one of the highest inflation rates in the country. And Biden's low approval ratings aren't the only hint that this could push voters toward Trump: Polls have found that voters trust him more than Biden to handle the economy.

Conventional wisdom holds that a sitting president with such low approval on economic issues faces headwinds to reelection. And with consumer costs remaining high, Democrats have been left to push back against the prevailing ideas that their policies are to blame. It's a tough sell, even to many liberals.

A friend of Esche's, Lindsay Bowyer, said she's planning to vote for a third-party candidate, Jill Stein of the Green Party. Bowyer, who works in art education, is upset with the ultra-conservative turn in her state, including efforts to remove diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in education and pass anti-LGBTQ+ laws. She says she feels abandoned by the federal government on many of these issues.

""Particularly at the federal level, I have lost a lot of optimism,"" Bowyer said. ""I'm going to be directing more of my energy toward the state and local level.""

But she's also one of the many who have considered leaving Florida, in no small part due to the increased costs of housing, especially for home insurance. ""We have already had to switch insurance carriers because, in just a short three-year time span, our premium was going to double, and we simply couldn't afford it,"" she said. Her family's insurance broker encouraged them to budget, but they had to switch carriers and opt for a less comprehensive policy. ""If the money is not there, the money is not there,"" she said.

Bowyer said she doesn't blame presidents for every price increase, but there's a larger problem with both parties being out of touch. ""I don't really feel like they care about us. The more that I watched and the more that I learned, the more the two primary parties just seemed the same. And they both seem increasingly corrupt and out of touch with what the average American wants and needs,"" she said. ""I've never been somebody who expects the president … to be some kind of hero. But at this point, it just feels like the bar is below sea level.""

Carlucci says issues like Bowyer's increasing home insurance premiums are the kinds of issues politicians should be working on every day but are failing to address at a local, state and national level. ""[Voters] want to hear about that kind of stuff,"" he said. ""They're tired of the government getting into other cultural issues … Forget it. Let's talk about the basics.""

Losing disenchanted voters on either side of the aisle could make the difference this November in Duval County, and in swing areas like it around the country. Esche says she understands why some voters don't feel up to voting at all. ""What is missing in our politics right now is, it feels the constituents are being forgotten,"" she said. ""There's the culture wars, and there's the back and forth, and the Democrats versus Republicans. But in the meantime, there are very real people that are hurting.""",A parking lot with several cars and palm trees in front of a building with a 'NO' sign.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA5736A70>,2024-07-19 12:00:08+00:00,https://abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/538/florida-county-struggling-inflation-housing-costs-voters-trust/story?id=111878506,['Local/Regional' 'Politics'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/00a40596cd.png
af77dd9f2c,Financial Times,Are private banks still worth it? - Financial Times,"Stephen has been a client of private bank Hoare for his entire life and intends to remain one.

Sure, the UK’s oldest privately owned lender did not offer him the best mortgage. It was slow to launch its banking app and behind others in rolling out a digital card for Apple wallet. But when the 60-year-old investor, who declined to give his real name, needed help to write his will, he knew he could count on the elite lender.

“The one thing they do better than others is the sense that you can completely and utterly trust them,” he says. “The minute there’s a problem, someone you know will be on it and continue to be on it until it’s solved.”

C. Hoare & Co was founded in the late 17th century to cater to blue-blooded clients, and has numbered John Dryden, Jane Austen and Lord Byron among its account holders. Its oak-panelled offices on Fleet Street are reminiscent of the golden age of privately owned merchant banks, which flourished across the City of London to fund overseas trade. In its 352 years of existence, it has been owned by 12 generations of the Hoare family.

Over time, many private banks have turned away from their roots in commercial banking to focus on personal banking and wealth management. Many, including NatWest-owned Coutts, were swallowed by bigger banks and lost their private ownership structure. Now they are trying to find their place in a digital world where customer needs and wealth are changing shape.

Stricter regulation has curtailed their often infamous reputation for discretion and tax optimisation. Meanwhile, the rise of wealth managers such as St James’s Place and investment brokers such as Hargreaves Lansdown (along with cheaper digital upstarts), has eaten into their share of the high net worth market.

Some three centuries after the oldest institutions were founded, account holders and would-be customers face a pressing question: are private banks still worth it?

Private banks are by definition discriminatory. They typically require customers to have at least £100,000 in annual income and often have minimum savings and investment thresholds that can go up to, in the case of Barclays Private Bank, £5mn.

Fees depend on clients’ individual finances, but typically range between 1 and 2 per cent of their assets. They tend to be lower in percentage terms for wealthier clients and can be scrapped for the wealthiest of them.

Unlike retail banks, private lenders offer a full suite of tailored banking services, including specialised loans, high-value mortgages and structured loans to help clients invest in less traditional assets including commercial real estate and hotels.

Camilla Stowell, Coutts’ head of client coverage, says the bank provides a broad range of wealth management services, including banking, lending and investments, and financial planning. “The ability to provide flexible and complex credit can also be important for clients looking to utilise their asset base to invest in business opportunities or purchase luxury items like art or classic cars.”

Private banks’ main selling point is their focus on client relationships, with some even offering concierge services. HSBC says its concierge service can book the best tables at a Michelin-starred restaurant for its clients on 24-hour notice and set tickets aside for upcoming events including concerts and sports tournaments.

524,464Number of accounts managed by private banks — down 1 per cent in the past year

When FT Money asked readers for their own experiences with private banks many, like Stephen, cited the better service. They tend to pair clients with dedicated bankers who can hold their hands through financial decision making. They pick up the phone, can arrange meetings at the drop of a hat, take out their clients for lunch and visit them in their homes.

Alex Barkley, a banking strategist and managing partner at Lancero Capital, a venture capital and private equity investor, says one of the key things they sell is the ephemeral feeling of belonging to an elite club. “You feel like a rock star. You feel like you’ve made it,” he says.

Andrew Salmon, chief executive at Arbuthnot Latham, a private bank founded in 1833, is keen to stress that his doors are open to clients beyond the ultra-rich.

The bank, which has a specialised division for media personalities and executives — and became a creditor to bankrupt tennis player Boris Becker — typically requires clients to have £500,000 in investible assets, deposits or borrowing needs.

“Private banking [evokes] mega yachts and sparkling seas and I’m sure it exists for the people who are in that category,” he says. “But it’s required by people who have much more modest wealth than that.”

A stellar relationship with your banker can only get you so far. Some clients told us that having a close personal relationship with their bank does not necessarily translate into accessing bespoke financing.

Private banks face record costs linked to the burden of regulations and the cost of modernising their legacy IT systems. A report by data company Compeer found that 24 of the UK’s private banks had a total cost base of £2.8bn last year, compared with £1.8bn for both full service wealth managers and investment managers.

Chartered financial planner Michael Lawrence says that many financial adviser platforms offer a “far cheaper and comprehensive” technology-driven service. By contrast, old technology and bank regulation had created a risk for private lenders that meant they had lost their discretionary focus for most clients.

I have a charming bank manager who looks after me, genuinely cares about me as a customer and what have you, but I’m afraid the mechanics of the bank are wholly outdated

“Private banks still offer useful services, but the level of wealth one needs to have to benefit from the higher cost has gone up considerably in the last decade,” he says.

Private banks had a combined £407bn of assets in the UK at the end of 2023 and managed about 524,000 accounts, roughly half the 1mn accounts managed by full service wealth managers. And while wealth managers increased their account numbers by 2 per cent in the past year, the number of private banks’ customer accounts fell by 1 per cent over the same period.

C Hoare & Co offloaded its wealth management arm to a subsidiary of asset manager Schroders in 2017, saying a bigger owner would help it meet technology and regulatory demands.

“Anyone coming to a private bank with £5mn of assets is either uninformed, has an ego that needs to be associated with a private bank name, or is poorly advised because they cannot actually do very much for you,” Lawrence says.

“Over the years the compliance regulations and their cost of operations mean that most people are invested via a single unit trust, or a model portfolio service, meaning [for most] there is next to no discretionary element.”

Private banks contacted by the FT declined to comment.

Charles McDowell, a luxury property agent who is also a client of Coutts, says his bank’s back office and underwriting processes are “a shambles” that no amount of delightful customer service can solve. McDowell says the bank was not able to give him the overdraft he wanted and could afford, blaming the mandatory and onerous stress-testing process.

“I have a charming bank manager who looks after me, genuinely cares about me as a customer and what have you, but I’m afraid the mechanics of the bank are wholly outdated,” he says.

Another Coutts customer said the service quality had degraded over time, with perks including access to airport lounges and luggage emergency cover becoming fee-paying. The closure of a local branch affected his ability to meet advisers, while he was turned away for a bridging loan which he could afford that the bank said NatWest could not provide.

Coutts said: “We do not comment on individuals’ circumstances, including confirming whether or not they are a client.”

Private bankers’ hands are tied by the same regulations and processes that govern other retail banks. This includes stringent anti-money laundering and compliance checks that can be time-consuming; and stress-testing for mortgage availability. Like other retail banks, they have to enforce Consumer Duty principles and will be required to reimburse fraudulent payments of up to £415,000 from October.

Some of these rules hit private banks hardest because they deal with clients whose wealth is spread across multiple tax jurisdictions and in more complex investment products.

Do tech founders and entrepreneurs find a 200-year-old bank sexy and exciting? Probably not

Peter Tyler, director of personal banking at trade body UK Finance, says private banks in the UK face an increased focus on anti-money laundering controls that made private banking more challenging and costly than retail banking in the mass market.

Tom, a former investment banker, was “debanked” from his private bank once he was no longer a tax resident in the UK. Having to move 17 accounts was “quite a huge pain in the ass,” says Tom, who declined to give his real name.

“It’s a bit like Brexit in that it’s a ton of work, there’s no benefit, you don’t have a choice about whether you do it. And at the end of it, the best result is slightly worse than where you were before.”

After transferring money out of his account in chunks of £50,000 due to daily limits, he realised he could get better rates on foreign exchange with fintech Wise. But those transactions were flagged as suspected fraud, leading to him having calls with the bank that each cost money in addition to costs linked to the tax implications of moving the money elsewhere.

“You can have worse divorces than this. They were with me all the way through university, through my career as a banker, my development, career changes.”

Another existential challenge for private banks is appealing to a new generation of wealth creators who do not share the same characteristics as their historic aristocratic client base. The lenders who can appear traditional and stuffy are courting dynamic clients such as tech entrepreneurs, athletes and musicians.

“Do tech founders and entrepreneurs find a 200-year-old bank sexy and exciting? Probably not,” says Barkley.

They also come with baggage. Many of those banks flourished due to their role in facilitating international trade through the British empire, which has also come under more scrutiny in recent years and can repel certain clients.

Arbuthnot Latham founders, Alfred Latham and James Alves Arbuthnot, were both linked to the slave trade, and the bank would go on to be a funder of Britain’s colonial exploits. In 2020, the bank told The Guardian newspaper: “Arbuthnot Latham stands against racism and discrimination in all forms, and is committed to diversity across the bank.”

Stowell at Coutts says the 330-year-old bank, which counts the UK royal family among its clients, was looking to “make sure that [it doesn’t] live in the past” and focused on being digital, including replicating some of fintechs’ “fabulous ideas”.

Managing it in practice appears to be a balancing act the bank is still trying to navigate. In an email to staff in June seen by the FT, Stowell told off bankers for “turning up to these visible meetings in T-shirts etc” and “losing the impact of the experience that we want to deliver”.

The bank reminded client-facing staff to blur their Zoom background and “dress for discretion not distraction”.

Banks have in recent years tried to embrace more modern values. Coutts has been a certified “B-corp” since 2019, meaning it meets a set of standards linked to “social and environmental performance, public transparency and accountability to balance profit and purpose.”

The bank also boasts inclusion credentials that include “providing feedback to leaders on how their teams are feeling” and “creating a great place to work that celebrates diversity”.

Such a rebrand is not easy to pull off. Coutts was rocked by a scandal last year after politician Nigel Farage claimed he had been “debanked” by the lender for his political views.

Although an independent review found his “debanking” was primarily linked to commercial factors, the politician proved that the bank’s reputational committee had accused him of being a “disingenuous grifter” whose values clashed with those of Coutts as an inclusive organisation.

The bank was then told to improve its communications to clients by the law firm that conducted an independent review into the affair.

McDowell, who has been a customer for most of his life, says the bank should “stop doing all that B-corp stuff and all that nonsense of responsibility, accountability and trying to be a moralistic organisation” and “concentrate on just offering people a proper banking service”.

“I couldn’t give a damn what they think about social morality and the worst of it,” says McDowell. “All I want is for them to be a bank”","An image of a person standing at the bottom of a staircase leading up to a bank building with a pound sign on the roof, set against a purple sky with clouds.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA31FA3B0>,2024-08-10 04:00:27.068000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/fc38385e-81f5-4311-972e-ca08a8dfaa9b,['Business and Finance' 'National'],[0.95 0.75],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/af77dd9f2c.png
3be367bd18,The Atlantic,Who Really Benefits From the Great Remote-Work Experiment? - The Atlantic,"Four years after the great remote-work experiment began, the public debate has boiled down to: Bosses hate it and workers love it. That’s the story we’re told time and again in a zero-sum debate that leaves little room for nuance. In reality, remote work depends on all sorts of things—the industry, the occupation, and interests of employers and workers, not to mention the interests of government and the broader public. Somehow, remote work is both a remarkable boon and a tremendous loss.

In our first episode of Good on Paper, I talk with Natalia Emanuel, a labor economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who has co-authored a paper trying to tease out what happened to workers after they went remote. Her research focuses on software engineers at an unnamed Fortune 500 company, some of whom were functionally remote even before the pandemic because their teams were spread out over a large campus. When COVID-19 came and everyone was sent home, it created the perfect circumstances to assess what was really happening to workers once they went remote.

Our conversation delves into all sorts of questions. Do people understand the tradeoffs they are making when they choose to work remote? What’s the impact on a team if even one person goes remote? Does remote work benefit older women at younger women’s expense? What happens to people’s social lives in the era of remote work?

Listen to the conversation here:

The following is a transcript of the episode:

[Music]

Jerusalem Demsas: My name is Jerusalem Demsas, and I’m a staff writer here at The Atlantic. And this is the first episode of Good on Paper.

Good on Paper is a policy show that questions what we really know about popular narratives. Narratives do a lot to drive what our world looks like—whether they exist in the broader media ecosystem or as a consensus within a specific group of people, like economists or policy wonks. But sometimes these narratives are built on shoddy ground. One fact, or a set of reasonable facts, spins out of control and is woven into a tale that goes well beyond what we actually know.

This show came about as an extension of my own writing and reporting here at The Atlantic because over the years, as I’ve written about a bunch of things—from why it’s so hard to build a wind farm in Alabama to why a bunch of people had babies during the pandemic—I’m struck time and again by the strength that certain narratives have. There are overly broad and often overly simplistic claims about the world that play a huge role in how our political system works.

And I’ll be completely honest. There are plenty of times where I’ve realized those kinds of ideas are playing a role in my own thinking. That’s sort of my beat. I dig in when I see something that seems off or undertheorized or at least not super fleshed out. And while there’s no one right answer, the goal of this show is to figure out what we really know about a topic and use research to get a deeper understanding of the truth.

This episode of Good on Paper is about the messy economics of remote work.

[Music]

Behind the scenes in this whole debate is the presumption that remote work is good for employees and bad for employers and bosses. But is that true? For my part, I’ve been a bit disillusioned by the remote-work experiment. There are, of course, amazing benefits to remote work. For those with disabilities or dependents, remote work can be more than just convenient; it can open up opportunities that hadn’t been possible.

But at the same time, there have been some serious costs—missing out on the social part of work. Sure, there’s some annoying water-cooler chitchat, but I have a nagging feeling that I’ve lost out on important learning and connections by being remote.

Most of all, it’s not really clear to me how you make these decisions fairly. Can my desire to work in person with my colleagues trump another person’s desire to work from another city? It’s still something I’m working out.

A few weeks ago, I talked with Natalia Emanuel. She’s a labor economist working at the New York Federal Reserve Bank. And she wrote a really interesting paper that helps unlock the varied impacts of remote work.

All right, Natalia. Welcome to the show.

Natalia Emanuel: Thank you so much for having me. I’m really excited to be here. Before we begin, I do note that the views I would express today are my own. They don’t reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System at all, so they’re simply mine.

Demsas: Yeah. So you were finishing your Ph.D. when COVID hit, right?

Emanuel: That is correct.

Demsas: How was that? Did remote work feel that different to you? I kind of imagine academics siloed off in their offices, never speaking to each other.

Emanuel: Ah, well, my co-author on two remote-work papers—her name is Emma Harrington, who is now an awesome professor at University of Virginia—she and I were randomly put into the same office in a second year of graduate school, and then partly because of that, we ended up becoming co-authors. Because before that, we actually hadn’t really known each other particularly well. So there is an element of: Yes, we were siloed. Yes, we were in the basement with almost no light at all. But by being in the same windowless office together, we did form a nice bond that way.

Demsas: This feels like an econ paper that’s, like, come to life. Isn’t this like a finding?

Emanuel: Exactly.

Demsas: Academics that sit near each other tend to co-author or something.

Emanuel: Correct, yeah. In terms of the actual COVID during the job market, it had a very important impact on us, which is that all of our job market was done remotely. So we were doing interviews remotely. We were doing flyouts to visit the potential places we might take jobs. All of that was not an actual flyout. That was a Zoom flyout. And so that was the place where it had more impact, perhaps on the actual paper writing.

Demsas: Did you think it affected the interviews or anything?

Emanuel: So purely anecdotally, I would say the people who I have given talks to remotely remember me and remember my findings less than when we were in person.

Demsas: Wow. Just because everyone’s doing, I don’t know, The New York Times Connections game while they’re listening to you. That makes sense.

Emanuel: I imagine it was email, but I think you have a more enjoyable thing. Maybe they liked my talk more because at least they were doing something fun.

Demsas: Yeah. I feel like before we get into the meat of your study, there are very different estimates about how many people are actually remote working right now. And it led me to realize: How do we actually know what’s happening? Do you have a sense of how many are remote working? Why does it feel like we're getting different answers from different data sources?

Emanuel: There is a big difference among different ways that you could ask this question and exactly what you mean by remote work. Does that mean that there is no place you have to go to for your work? Does it mean that you have to be in your workplace’s office as opposed to a cafe shop? Does it simply mean that you have to have left your bedroom?

You also can get different answers when you’re asking, Are you fully remote? versus, Are there certain days of the week when you are remote? versus, How many hours a week are you remote? And so those two dimensions can give a lot of variation in terms of exactly what number we’re getting.

Demsas: So the one that I’m going to just try to use in my head—and, for listeners, is what the BLS, Bureau of Labor Statistics, is doing—so in 2024, in February, their survey data shows that 77 percent of people did not telework at all. Around 11 percent of people teleworked all hours. And roughly 12 percent teleworked some hours. So it feels like this is a really big conversation, for 12 percent of the population to be fully remote working. Do you feel like that's an outsized conversation that we’re having about remote work?

Emanuel: Well, I think the 77 number of people who are not working remotely, that makes a lot of sense, insofar as some jobs are just really hard to do if you’re not on-site, right? Being a car mechanic: very hard to do if you are not actually at the car. Similarly, trauma surgery: Maybe one day it’ll be done by robots, and the robots are controlled by people who are far away; that’s not how trauma surgery is happening right now. Similarly, we’re not thinking about occupational therapists or nursery-school teachers. So many of those jobs, there just isn’t a possibility of them even being remote.

And so what we’re thinking about here are the jobs where there is a possibility of being remote. You can imagine sales, customer service, consultants, software engineer—many jobs that are more computer based, those are the ones where we should be thinking about remote work is a possibility.

Demsas: And the quintessential people who can work from home are probably software engineers and coders, which brings us to your study. So you have a working paper at the National Bureau of Economic Research—NBER—and it came out last November. Can you tell us about it?

Emanuel: Sure. We are looking at software engineers at a Fortune 500 company, and this is a sufficiently large company that they have on their main campus two buildings where the software engineers sit, and those buildings are about 10 minutes apart. Well, 12 minutes if you’re on Google Maps—10 minutes if you’re me.

We found that some of the people who were on teams where everybody could be in one building—whereas because there’s not as much desk availability, some teams actually had to be separated across those two buildings. And so the teams that were separated across the two buildings had most of their meetings online, because if you’re only having a 20-minute meeting, you’re not going to spend exactly the length of your meeting walking there and back.

And so we can see beforehand what happened to those particular teams. And then once the pandemic forced everybody to work remotely, we can see what happens thereafter. And so we can use the teams that were already meeting remotely, and they’re our control group: they’re remote before the pandemic; they’re remote after the pandemic. Whereas the people who are on one-building teams, they were with the rest of their colleagues, and then after the pandemic, they’re working remotely.

Demsas: Mm-hmm.

Emanuel: That’s an interesting context to look at, from our perspective, because it allows us to understand there is a measure of productivity, and then there’s also a measure of digital collaboration. And so we were trying to understand what remote work does for the pieces that you might learn from colleagues, right?

There’s another study that finds that a sixth of all skills that one acquires over their lifetime are coming from colleagues. And so we were very interested in the impact of remote work on this collaboration and on-the-job training.

And so we also think that software engineers are particularly interesting because, in many ways, it’s the best-case scenario for remote work. So for one, all of their output is digital. Also, software engineers have established mechanisms for giving each other digital feedback on their code, and that was something that they had sort of industry standard and has been for decades before the pandemic.

Demsas: What are your main results? You’re observing these software engineers, and as you say, these software engineers are basically just coding full-time. They’re just writing a bunch of code, and they’re getting comments on that code, and that’s how you’re looking at feedback. So what are the findings of that observation?

Emanuel: Yeah, we’re finding that the folks who were in person with their teams, they were in the same building—we’re going to call them one-building teams—they were getting about 22 percent more feedback from their colleagues on their code. So they were just getting more skills, more mentorship when the offices were open.

And then when the offices closed and everybody was going remote, pretty immediately we see that gap closes. And so then everybody is getting less feedback than they were. And this is useful as a counterfactual because if you imagine you’re saying, Oh, well. They’re getting 22 percent more feedback. Well, maybe that’s just because they tend to be chattier, or maybe it’s because they really actually need that feedback a little bit more, the people who are on one-building teams. If that were the case, then even after the offices close, that would still persist, whereas if this is something really coming from being in person with your colleagues, then that gap would close. And that’s exactly what we find.

Demsas: So there are 11.5 percent more people commenting on engineers’ work if they’re in one-building teams than if they’re in the multi-building teams, right? So there are a lot more people commenting on your work if you’re in a one-building team. So what is happening there? Why is it that someone who’s in a one-building team is seeing more comments?

Emanuel: We look at this in terms of the exact type of comments. So part of this is they’re just getting more comments on the initial go, but then also they’re asking more follow-up questions and then getting more replies to the follow-up questions. And so we’re seeing the depth of conversation is partly driving this. We additionally see that this is happening in terms of speed—that they’re getting faster feedback, as well. And so there are many dimensions here.

I would also put a small asterisk here, which is that we’re measuring this in terms of the digital comments that they’re getting. But people who are in person, it is much easier to just turn to your neighbor and say, Hey, can we just talk about this for a quick second? And so if we think that that’s happening more among the people who are sitting next to each other, then the estimates that we’re getting are actually lower bounds.

Demsas: And so what’s the effect of all this? What’s the effect of getting more comments?

Emanuel: There are a number. The first is that, as you might imagine, if they’re working on building skills and responding to these comments, their actual output is a little bit lower, so they’re producing fewer programs overall. And, accordingly, because they are producing fewer programs, they also are less likely to get a pay raise.

But once the office is closed and that level of mentorship has now equalized, the people who have been working on building their skills, they’re actually more likely to be getting pay raises. And they’re actually twice as likely to be quitting to go to a higher-paying job or a job at a higher-paying company.

And so, it really depends on the time frame that you’re thinking about this. In the short run, it looks a little painful because they’re not doing as well. But in the long run, you’re seeing the fruits of their labor.

Demsas: I find this really interesting because what it indicates is that there’s this investment that happens early on in someone’s career, and then when they go remote, the people who had that kind of investment are able to still capitalize on it. But in time, they’re going to look less productive than their more remote peers. Those remote peers are just banging through code. They’re not having to respond or engage with their mentors or with the older engineers. It’s a strange finding because it would indicate that managers would really prioritize and see that remote work was doing well in the short term.

Emanuel: Totally. And I think that is consistent with what we saw at Meta, right? Early in the pandemic, Mark Zuckerberg was like, Yeah, this sounds great. People seem to actually be more productive when they’re remote. And then sort of three years in, that’s when Mark Zuckerberg was like, Actually, let’s come back to the office. It seems that people actually are more productive when we have some amount of in-person time. And so it does seem as though it does take a little bit of patience to be able to realize these different effects over different time horizons.

Demsas: Wait, you mentioned Meta. Is this Meta?

Emanuel: So I’m actually not allowed to share what company we’re studying.

Demsas: Okay, great. Well, I will just, in my head, imagine a giant campus in Silicon Valley that has multiple buildings where software engineers work far apart.

Emanuel: That sounds like a perfect thing to imagine.

Demsas: And people can draw their own conclusions.

And so do these findings contradict earlier findings in the space? Existing literature about remote work and productivity, as I’ve mentioned before, it’s kind of mixed. But there’s the seminal 2015 study from Nicholas Bloom where he looks at a 16,000-employee company in China. And the study design there, it’s employees that volunteer. They then randomly assign those to either be work from home or in the office. And they find that work from home leads to a 13-percent performance increase in productivity, so both more minutes per shift and more calls per—it’s a call center—so it’s more minutes per shift that they’re making calls and also more calls per minute. And so that feels very different than what you’re finding here.

Emanuel: Yeah, so first of all, I think that it is totally possible to have different findings in different settings. One of the things that makes Nick’s study particularly interesting is there it was, as you mentioned, all volunteers. Right? These were existing workers who had been at the company already, and they volunteered to go remote. So that’s not necessarily the case when we’re thinking about the pandemic. Not everybody volunteered to be remote.

Also, in that context, everybody had to have their own room to work in as a specific workspace, as separate from people who are working on their bed. And so that also could change it. And so you do see potentially different outcomes there.

Also at a travel agency, that is pretty siloed work, whereas as software engineers, they do need to understand what this code base is doing, how people have been thinking about that particular function already. And so there is a little bit more of a collaborative nature there.

Demsas: Mm-hmm.

Emanuel: The other thing I would note is that, eventually, remote work unraveled in that context because there were fewer promotions happening among the remote workers. And so people ended up wanting to come back to the office because that’s where they got the visibility to be able to get the promotions that that higher performance really warranted.

Demsas: And so they weren’t getting promotions, because they were doing worse work? Or they weren’t doing promotions, because managers had this attitude that people who are in person, who they’re talking to in the office—those people are just more worthy of promotions?

Emanuel: Well, I wouldn’t say that they were doing worse work. According to Nick’s paper, it seemed as though they were actually doing better work.

They were overall more productive. But it does seem as though there is a disconnect between pure productivity metrics and the human component of promotions.

Demsas: And so you have a 2023 study where you look at a call center. It’s a U.S.-based call center, and I’m not sure how else it may differ from Bloom’s study. But you find that pre-COVID, remote workers were answering 12 percent fewer calls per hour, and that feels like there’s something going on that’s stably less productive about remote work, even in the same work context. So what’s going on in understanding the differences in your findings versus Nick Bloom’s?

Emanuel: Yeah, so in our study, we were finding that before the pandemic, the people who elected to work remotely, at least in this company—which, again, as you mentioned, we were thinking about a Fortune 500 company and their customer-service workers—and there we found that the people who chose to work remotely tended to have lower productivity, on average, than the people who chose to be in person. And so that’s what economists would call negative selection.

But that is also consistent with, if you anticipate that the people who are going to get promotions are those who have closer connections to the managers and are those who are going to be in person and that you might be, not to use a horrible pun, but you might be phoning it in a little bit—

Demsas: (Laughs.)

Emanuel: Then that would make sense that you would be more willing to be remote. Now, of course, I have no idea what was in each individual person’s mind, but that is consistent with understanding that there is a promotion penalty to being remote.

Demsas: Okay. So returning to your original new study also about remote work, but I think the thing that’s really interesting about the research you find is this junior-versus-senior benefits to remote work, right?

So I really want to talk about how different it is if you’re an early-career software engineer versus a late-career software engineer. What happens to people early career versus late career when it comes to remote work? How does that affect their productivity? How does it affect how they do their jobs, what research they’re getting, and their long-term outcomes?

Emanuel: In general, it’s the people who are most junior who have the most to learn and are getting the most comments and therefore having to do the most learning. And who’s giving this feedback? Well, that’s the more senior people. Those are the people who have been with the firm a lot longer.

We see that the hit to productivity is actually happening both among junior people, but then particularly it is concentrated among the senior people who then have to be really understanding somebody else’s code and thinking deeply about it and giving them feedback to try to think, Oh, how can I help this person grow? And how can I help make sure that this code is doing well?

And so that meant that for the senior people, there was a cost in their productivity from being in person and providing all of that feedback. And so that means when they go remote, particularly the senior people’s productivity actually increased. And so again, for them, you could see a boost in productivity right at the beginning of remote work. And then from the firm’s perspective, you could imagine that that might not persist forever if you're then getting your junior engineers who aren’t getting as upskilled as you might hope.

Demsas: So senior folks are just like, Thank God I don’t have to answer all these comments all the time. I can just do my job, and that benefits them. I wonder though—I think this is really interesting, right? Because popularly understood is that people who are young really want to work remote and that older people are more willing to come back to the office for whatever reason.

Why is there this disconnect if it is the case that young people are really missing out on this both productivity-enhancing but also, as you said, wage-enhancing and promotion-enhancing benefit of learning from senior engineers? Why aren’t they clamoring to get back in the office?

Emanuel: One hypothesis is that they simply don’t know, right? Maybe they are not aware of the benefits of mentorship from being in the office. Maybe they’re not aware about how that mentorship and the skill building actually translates into future jobs, future earnings. So that’s one possibility.

Another possibility is: Maybe they have a different value system, right? Maybe they’re willing to say, Look, my job is not the top priority for me, and it’s much more important for me that I am spending time with my roommates, my neighbor, my friends, my loved ones. That’s a possibility.

I think another possibility, and there our paper gives a little bit of evidence, is that if you have even one colleague who is remote, that yields about 30 percent of the loss from having everyone be remote.

Demsas: Wait, so if just one person on your team goes remote, you lose all of that benefit of being in person?

Emanuel: Well, a third of it, yeah.

Demsas: A third of it. That’s huge!

Emanuel: Right. It’s huge, from just one person.

Demsas: Does it scale up? If it’s a second person, did you find anything there?

Emanuel: We didn’t actually look at that. But it is a huge impact. Really, in some ways, that’s validating. It means every single person really matters.

But if it’s the case that when they come into the office, not everybody is there, and so they’re still doing some remote Teams meetings or Webex or whatever it is while in the office, then it’s possible that they’re not actually getting the whole benefit of being in the office. And so, perfectly rationally, they’re saying, Maybe it’s not so much. Maybe I’m not getting all of this mentorship.

And so there you go: three hypotheses.

Demsas: I am partial to the last two things you said. I don’t really buy hypotheses, usually, where someone’s just being dumb and they’re doing something that’s bad for them. I usually buy that they either are prioritizing something else—like, not everyone wants to be a productivity-maximizing machine. They may want to just not have a commute. They may want to live near their family. Whatever it is.

And I think also this last thing that you said is really important, too. Because The Atlantic offices are open, but there’s a lot of hybrid work, and so you’re coming in on a day where there might be 10 people on your team, and then coming in on a day where you’re like, Wow, I’m the only person on my team here. And those are very different days, and they are very different things you might get out of that. So that hits stronger for me.

Emanuel: One of the things that’s pretty interesting is that we find even when you’re in a building with colleagues who are not on your team, we still find a bump in the mentorship and the feedback that one gets. And it’s not from your teammates, then, of course. It’s from the non-teammates. But there still is an element of enhanced mentorship, feedback, collaboration simply by being around people.

Demsas: We’re going to take a quick break, but more with Natalia Emanuel when we get back.

[Break]

Demsas: I think that probably the most interesting angle in your piece is the angle on gender. Can you tell us a little about this? What is different about how women in this firm receive feedback on their code?

Emanuel: Yeah, so before the pandemic, we find that female engineers are receiving about 40 percent more comments on their code than our male engineers, giving us an effect that’s roughly twice the size as it is for male engineers, overall. And so we’re finding that this mentorship is particularly important for female engineers. And to unpack where that’s coming from, we find that the female engineers are much more likely to ask questions when they are in person.

Demsas: So, when I first heard this, I was just like, Okay, are they getting more feedback because people are just nitpicking women’s code? How did you decide whether or not this was actually actionable feedback or if it’s just people being sexist?

Emanuel: Yeah, this was one of our first concerns. One of the first people we presented to said, Are we sure this isn’t mansplaining? And so what we did is we took a subset of the code, of the comments, and we gave them anonymized to other engineers and said, Is this comment helpful? Is it actionable? Is it rude? And we then took their reviews back, and we found that they are equally actionable, not differentially nitpicky for female engineers. And so it does really seem as though these are substantive, meaningful comments but not simply mansplaining—and interestingly, not differentially rude, either.

Demsas: That’s great to hear, actually. And, sorry, these external reviewers, they were blind to gender when they were looking at the code, right?

Emanuel: They were blind to gender. They were blind to seniority. They were blind to whether you were proximate or not proximate to your colleagues. All they saw was the comment.

Demsas: And what that raises for me, though, is this question: If women are disproportionately getting actionable feedback, is the claim that women’s code is just worse than men’s?

Emanuel: So we don’t actually see the code itself, but we can see that we’re not finding they’re more problematic overall. It’s not as though we’re seeing, Oh, there’s bigger issues brought up in the comments, or sort of, They will always break, or something like that.

Demsas: I find this interesting. And I also think it’s interesting because this is not the only plane on which women are affected differently than men in your study. You have this finding that junior women are receiving a lot more code and a lot more actionable feedback, and it’s benefiting them potentially down the line. But you’re also finding that the people who are giving them all that feedback tend to be senior women engineers who, for themselves, as you said before, giving all that feedback takes time. That’s something that hurts your productivity, so that cost seems disproportionately borne by senior women.

Emanuel: Yeah, I think you said it exactly right, that the feedback that’s going to both female and male junior engineers, a lot of that is coming from female senior engineers. And so the giving of the mentorship is also coming from female engineers. And so we see a lot of exaggerated effects on both the benefit sides for females, so junior women are getting the benefits, but also senior women are paying the price.

Demsas: And so when they go remote, do senior women get more productive?

Emanuel: Mm-hmm. Yeah.

Demsas: That’s really weird, right? Because I feel like the dominant frame for the pandemic and gender was mostly around this idea that women, when they were going remote, were being now doubly burdened, right? So you go home, and if you’re a mother, you have to do more child care. Often, you’re finding you have to share space with your male partner, in a lot of cases. And it was the sense that potentially women are now having to be doubly burdened by the responsibilities of home and the responsibilities of work. Obviously, it’s not contradicted by your evidence, but were you surprised by this finding?

Emanuel: I would make one technical point and then one overall comment. The first technical point is that this is why it’s really, really helpful to have a control group, right? Because in both of our groups—both the people who are working in one-building teams beforehand and the people who are in multi-building teams and therefore a little remote beforehand—both of them would be similarly burdened by the pandemic. And so we can difference out the impact of the pandemic and really just zero in on the effect that’s only coming from working remotely. So that’s one component there.

The other piece that I would mention is that in our sample of engineers, only 16 percent are parents, so that doesn’t seem to be the main component here. And in some ways, I think that, while not helpful in terms of thinking about the impact of the pandemic, it’s potentially helpful in terms of thinking about remote work long term. When we’re thinking about remote work post-pandemic, we’re not really thinking about Oh, but you will also be trying to supervise your fifth grader’s language-arts exam.

Demsas: It’s hard for me to know how generalizable these findings are. And basically every major study I see on remote work is mainly done in the context of software engineers or call-center employees. And those are just two very specific types of jobs and are not maybe similar to a lot of other jobs that are potentially work remote, whether you’re working in HR or you’re working in media or you’re working as a lawyer or anywhere in the legal profession. It’s hard for me to know how much you can take away from this and apply to other contexts. How do you think about that?

Emanuel: Yes, you are totally right that the existing literature feels as though it really focuses on sales, call center, and software engineers, partly because those are places where we have really good measures of productivity. I would love to be able to think about this for other occupations, but I do think that we have a bit of a quantification problem.

As I mentioned earlier, I think one of the things that’s useful in our context is to think that software engineering is probably most amenable to remote work, and that other contexts don’t have these established ways of giving each other feedback online, don’t have very structured systems for how to meet. Software engineers often work on the agile system of meeting, where they have daily standup meetings that happen regardless of whether you’re in person or not. They have very structured ways of exactly when they are going to be doing a sprint on exactly what type of work, and they have a lot of coordination around who’s doing what when. And so for occupations that don’t have either of those things—digital means of giving feedback and that meeting structure—you can imagine remote work is likely to work less well for them.

Demsas: That feels like something that a lot of different industries could innovate on, right? One of the things that I’ve heard pointed out is how many more patents there are now on remote-work technologies. Not even just those technologies that help make it possible for a lot more firms to work at home, but also just the cultural technology: the fact that you can just ping someone on Slack, the fact that you can just huddle quickly—clearly, I use Slack way too much—or you can figure out a way to have a standup with your manager. In a media environment, you usually just walk over in a newsroom, but people now have standing meetings that they will just have with their manager. So how much of that is not portable to other workplaces?

Emanuel: Oh, I totally think many of these are portable. And I do think that we’re going to have some growing pains as people realize, Oh, I could just have a standing meeting, and then realizing that, Oh, but now I have a standing meeting with 15 people, and it’s taking up half of my Friday. And so I do think there will be some growing pains, but that there is quite a lot to learn from other organizations that have already done remote work pretty effectively.

Demsas: And so, zooming out a bit, Adam Ozimek—he’s also a labor economist, and he’s also a longtime booster of remote work—he once half-jokingly said that skeptics of remote work could basically be described as either extroverts, urbanists, workers in obviously non-remote occupations, and downtown office-building owners.

And a Venn diagram of labor economists and urbanists has significant overlap, and so I wanted to ask you if you think your background as a labor economist biases you against remote work or thinking that it’s positive. Do you feel that you’re coming into the work feeling like it’s not going to go well? Or how do you think about that?

Emanuel: Well, I’m definitely not an extrovert, so we can cross out that one. I would not say I had strong priors going into this. It was one of those topics that I was genuinely extremely excited to see whatever the results would be and could totally have spun a story that it could go in either direction.

Demsas: But, I mean, do you think that you would be surprised if long-term remote work was viable at a large scale across these firms? Even what you said at the beginning, when we started chatting, about your ability to meet Emma, your co-author, and work with her—I mean, those kinds of findings are often really strong underlying belief systems for labor economists.

Emanuel: I do think there’s totally a world in which remote work really takes off and we can have massive productivity gains. I think that this comes with a lot of growing pains that we were discussing, of trying to figure out exactly how we can still make sure that we form deep connections, have a lot of mentorship.

And I think we see a lot of firms doing some incredibly creative things, whether that’s quarterly offsites or teams coming in at regular intervals and trying to do sort of a round-robin of who's meeting with what. And so I do think we’re in a period of experimentation while we’re trying to learn how this is going to work. But yes, I would definitely say that there is a world in which this does work and that we have to figure out exactly how it's going to work.

Demsas: So, we’ve talked a lot about productivity here, but life isn’t just about productivity. There are lots of reasons why someone may or may not want to work remote. What’s your sense of the impact of remote work on individual well-being?

Emanuel: This is the question in many ways. On the one hand, maybe it allows folks to live close to their family, their community, and so there’s a really wonderful gain in terms of people’s well-being because they have these strong social connections. On the other hand, in many decades past, a lot of people found their friends at work, and many enduring friendships, many marriages originated in work. And so if people are not making those connections at work, there has to be some other way that they are going to be able to make those social connections that are going to sort of fulfill their needs.

Maybe that substitution is happening. I don’t think we have a great idea yet. And so I think you, again, could imagine it going either way, and I am extremely excited to see research coming out that can give us insight as to which one we’ll weigh more strongly.

Demsas: I’m a little bit pessimistic about it and, in part, I am because I feel like the trend of work technology has been to just eat into more and more of our leisure hours. Email gets invented, and all of a sudden you leave the office, and it doesn’t mean that you’ve left the office. And Slack gets invented. Now you have to be instantly available; even if you’re in the bathroom, you know that your boss has messaged you.

And then there was a 2021 paper that looked at GitHub activity and found that users were more likely to work on weekends and outside 9-to-6 hours when they went remote. And it feels to me that this is just another step in the machine of, Okay, remote work means now that there aren’t even defined hours. And in some sense, theoretically, that could mean flexibility, but in another sense can mean your entire life is now work.

Emanuel: I think that’s totally possible. I would say that there’s a world in which that GitHub finding that you mentioned is actually a really good thing, right? So imagine the world in which I know exactly what my hours of output have to be. I know the product that I need to create. But I actually want to stop work at 3 p.m. so I can pick up my kids from school, hang out with them until, you know, 7:30 or 8, when they go to sleep. And then I want to put in my extra two hours that, you know, would have happened between 3 and 5 but now can happen after bedtime.

So maybe that extra flexibility is actually welfare enhancing, and the people they’re studying are actually really happy about that. And so I think simply based on that statistic, it’s not obvious to me whether we think of this as a good thing or a bad thing.

I do think work creeping and taking over one’s entire life so that there’s nothing else there and there’s no time for anything else—I think that’s almost certainly a bad thing. But again, I’m not sure exactly how to think about the welfare implications there.

Demsas: Before we close things out, our last question: What’s an idea that you’ve had that was good on paper?

Emanuel: So I sew a lot. I’ve sewn 17 quilts, several wedding dresses, only one of which was for me. And so one idea that I think tends to look good on paper is the home sewing machine that is computerized.

Demsas: Oh. What is that?

Emanuel: It’s just a sewing machine that has a screen on it and that you can say, Oh, do this embroidery pattern, and it’ll output that. And, I would say, for the type of sewing that I was doing, it was 100 percent useless. It meant that it was much harder to maintain, much harder to troubleshoot. You can’t do your own oiling and maintenance in the same way that you could for a mechanical sewing machine.

At one point, the sewing machine actually just decided to only run in reverse. And rather like driving in New York City in reverse, it’s possible, but it’s a little anxiety inducing—not the world’s safest thing. So I ended up reverting back to the sewing machine that’s fully mechanical, was made in 1910 by Singer sewing machine, is actually foot powered, hadn’t been used in the entirety of my lifetime but with a little bit of elbow grease was totally great. So it was one of those things that, in the abstract, seemed great and, in real life, was not.

Demsas: Well, this feels like a metaphor, a productivity-enhancing machine that actually reduced your output. On that note, well, thank you so much for coming on the show, Natalia.

Emanuel: Thank you so much for having me.

1299f6ac0f,The New York Times,The Mystery of the Disappearing Breast Pocket - The New York Times,"What is going on with breast pockets on shirts? Where did they go on men’s shirts? And why do they still exist on women’s? How does any of this make any sense? — Kristine, Boston

Pockets are one of those seemingly small details that provoke an outsize amount of opinions and unexpectedly strong feelings — whether about the fact that women’s clothing doesn’t have more of them or the incredible disappearing breast pocket.

Because, yes, the breast pocket has been falling out of favor for a while now, at least when it comes to the case of dress shirts, where it has become a victim of both fashion and technology.

On J. Crew’s website, only two styles on the three pages of men’s dress shirts come with a breast pocket, while at Suitsupply, none of the classic shirts have breast pockets. Even at Brooks Brothers, purveyor of men’s wear tradition, which says it sells over four million shirts a year, according to Arthur Wayne, a spokesman, 40 percent of shirts are now sold without a breast pocket, a number that has been increasing over time.

A largely midcentury invention, the breast pocket became popular as vests fell out of fashion because men, who didn’t carry handbags, needed more places to store their stuff. If a wallet could be slipped into suit pants or jackets, the breast pocket turned out to be the perfect place to carry pens and stow eyeglasses.

Since the turn of the millennium, however, as writing implements have become less and less important and phones have replaced pocket protectors, which themselves started getting a not-entirely-appealing nerd rep, breast pockets have had a similarly diminished reason for being (that is, bulkier phones are more easily stashed in a pants pocket).

At the same time, slim-line silhouettes became more and more popular. As Michael Bastian, the creative director of Brooks Brothers, said when I asked, “For me, on a classic dress suit, no pocket feels more polished.” This is especially true if the shirt is worn under a jacket.

When it comes to women’s wear, however, as with many items that have been appropriated from a man’s wardrobe for a woman’s, and because the button-up shirt functions as a symbol as much as an actual item, the breast pocket serves to underscore the semiology of its origins — which may be why it remains. In this sense, its purpose is less practical than political.

Indeed, said Jeffrey Kalinsky, the designer for Theory, “pockets on a women’s shirt should be there to reflect a reference, such as military or safari, or to suggest a feeling.” Like, say, “boss.”

But given the general trend, he added, “I think the most important piece a woman can have in her closet right now is a very classic, slightly oversize men’s wear white poplin shirt with no pockets.” Of all the Theory women’s shirts, only one — a cropped camp style — has a pocket.

All of which means what? As with much of fashion now, including jeans and hem lengths, “there really isn’t a rule,” Mr. Bastian said. It’s up to the individual, which can be both liberating (yay, personal choice!) and confusing (so many options to sift through).

Still, you can take comfort in the fact that when it comes to shirts and pockets, Mr. Kalinsky believes there remains one immutable law: “Chambray shirts need breast pockets for all genders.”

c0c7a2db7a,CNN,Why UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called an election he’s expected to lose - CNN,"When British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced on Wednesday that the United Kingdom would hold a general election on July 4, many observers wondered: why now?

More specifically, why has the PM called an election that is almost certain to lose? For months, polls have placed Sunak’s Conservative Party way behind the opposition Labour Party and, as things stand, Labour leader Keir Starmer is set to not only win power but have a massive parliamentary majority.

The answer to that question is simple: it’s very unlikely there will be a better time. Almost everything Sunak tries seems to backfire, and it’s not implausible that his favorability with the public will get even worse before the end of the year.

The past couple of days have been relatively good for Sunak. The economy does seem to be recovering, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) updating the UK’s growth forecast and inflation finally returning to something resembling a normal level.

Nothing went catastrophically wrong in the last week or so ahead of calling the election. It’s a low bar, but since his time in office, right now he probably has the most stable base to launch a campaign that he’s ever had or ever will have.

As one key adviser to Sunak told CNN:

“The PM came into office facing a series a key challenges: inflation, no growth, migration. And he saw dealing with those as his primary mission. And he’s made genuine and significant progress on that. On Tuesday, the IMF upgraded our growth forecasts, yesterday we saw inflation back to normal levels, today we see migration falling as a result of our reforms.

“So we’ve got a solid foundation to say that things are going in the right direction, and the view was that now was the best time to go to the country and say ‘here’s what we’ve done, our plan is working, now who do you think has the plan and the capacity to take the bold action to move this country forwards towards a more secure future.’”

Sunak had to call the election before the end of this year, constitutionally speaking. The fact he hadn’t until this week allowed his opponents to paint him as a coward, terrified of facing the public.

It didn’t help that the country has felt in need of an election for quite a long time, nor that the Conservative Party has looked from the outside like a basket case for a number of years.

Their time in office didn’t begin formidably. In 2010, after 13 years of Labour rule, David Cameron won the general election but didn’t win a majority in parliament. He was forced to make a coalition government with the centrist Liberal Democrats.

Cameron, against the odds, kept the coalition together until the 2015 election, at which he won a surprise majority and secured the first fully Conservative government since 1997.

The celebrations didn’t last long. Holding the 2016 Brexit referendum split his party in two and made governing nearly impossible for his four (yes, four) successors. First up was Theresa May.

A botched snap election and the inability to pass her Brexit deal because her party hated it ended May’s tenure, and she was replaced by Boris Johnson in 2019. Johnson blew his own majority when he became so weighed down by scandal – including the notorious illegal parties in Downing Street during the Covid-19 pandemic – he had to resign in 2022.

Liz Truss took over for 45 days, in which time she managed to cause sufficient economic havoc that the pound sank to its lowest ever level against the dollar, interest rates spiked and inflation ballooned. Eventually, the Conservative Party had enough of the chaos and put Sunak in charge as a safe pair of hands.

Whether or not he has been that is up for debate. Despite what Conservative sources might say about his record in office, his dire poll ratings cannot be denied.

His flagship immigration policy, which would see illegal migrants sent to Rwanda to have their asylum claims processed, has already cost millions despite the fact only one person – voluntarily and given money to do so – has made the trip.

His world-leading smoking ban, which caused Sunak major embarrassment when his own MPs didn’t approve it, has been shelved due to the election.

These are just two recent examples of how things seem to go wrong for Sunak. But the most damaging issue around him is the general sense that he is a bit of a loser and that his own party has so little faith in him. No amount of facts, figures or soundbites can change that he has an undeniable stench of failure around him. The sense that something is inevitable is powerful in politics, and for Sunak, defeat seems inevitable.

Of course, it isn’t. There is a chance that the polls are misleading us, and there is a chance that the Conservative campaign will work.

They are making it personal: a clear choice between Labour leader Starmer and Sunak. Conservatives claim Starmer cannot be trusted on national security, is a shameless opportunist with no principles and has no plan.

Right now is probably the best time to hammer that message home. Labour will have to rush out its manifesto, which will inevitably be picked apart by commentators. The longer Sunak held off, the more time Labour had to get its house in order.

Sunak inherited a mess, no one can deny that. It currently seems unlikely that he has cleaned up that mess enough to earn the Conservatives another term in office. But given the size of the task ahead of him, it makes sense that he seize on this rare period of good news and hope for the best.","A man in a suit and tie stands in the rain, with a microphone in front of him, in front of a black door with a gold-colored handle.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA4C4B5E0>,2024-05-24 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/24/uk/prime-minister-rishi-sunak-election-intl/index.html,['Politics' 'International'],[0.95 0.75],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/c0c7a2db7a.png
070017c058,The New York Times,Tracey Tully - Page 7 - The New York Times,"Tracey Tully

I’m a reporter for The New York Times who covers New Jersey.

What I Cover

I’m a regional reporter, which means I cover a range of news within a geographic boundary. If it happens in New Jersey, or affects the 9.3 million people who live here, I pay attention. Much of my time is spent focused on breaking news, criminal justice initiatives and state governance, including legislation, lawmakers and people who run for office to represent New Jersey in Trenton or Washington. I often cover events in person, and I spend a lot of time in my car, crisscrossing the state. I am drawn to the odd and the whimsical and am in awe of the vast trove of public documents that are available through open records requests and targeted web searches.

Don’t believe everything you think you know about New Jersey. It’s an endlessly fascinating state filled with plenty of unpaved surfaces and well-meaning public servants.

My Background

I have worked as both a reporter and an editor in New Jersey and New York for more than 30 years. My first journalism job, in 1991, involved covering the tiny township of Weehawken, N.J., and the state’s second-largest community, Jersey City. I went on to cover crime, the court system and New York State government, from Albany, N.Y., and City Hall in New York City.

I was born in Elizabeth, N.J., but raised in upstate New York. Since 2000, when the first of my three children was born, my husband and I have lived in New Jersey. I joined The Times in 2018 as an editor; in late 2019, I asked to return to reporting and was thrilled to be told “Yes.”

I’m a graduate of Boston College and I taught third grade in the Bronx after college. I was horrible, the kids were spectacular and it was the best two-year graduate education I could ever imagine.

Journalistic Ethics

My true north as a journalist is to be fair. To me, this means providing readers with necessary context and listening well to the individuals who trust me enough to share their most painful moments or deeply held beliefs with the entire world. I think readers should be invited to enter a story from multiple points of view. And I believe doing that requires me to be aggressively curious.

My kids tell me I’m a rule-follower, and I’m grateful that The Times lays out its ethical expectations for its employees clearly, in a handbook. When I make a mistake, tell me. I strive to be accurate, and I believe in admitting error. I make no campaign contributions, and I choose not to register with either major political party, though The Times does not forbid that. I’ll accept a cup of coffee from a potential source, but nothing else, and only if you let me buy you one, too.","A black and white image of a person with short hair, wearing a patterned top, with a blurred face.",<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x117 at 0x7D6BA260C8E0>,NaT,https://www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/by/tracey-tully?page=7,['Local/Regional' 'Politics'],[0.95 0.85],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/070017c058.png
e57bc60f1b,The Associated Press,Co-owner John Mara wants to see progress from Giants in 2024 after disappointing 2023 season - The Associated Press,"HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) — New York Giants co-owner John Mara and his family have been around the NFL long enough to know not to label an upcoming season make-or-break for the front office and coaching staff.

The Giants’ 100th season in the league is still more than a month away and everyone involved knows he and the fans are not happy with the 6-11 record in 2023.

It was disappointing, especially coming off the unexpected success coach Brian Daboll and general manager Joe Schoen had in their first season when New York went 9-7-1 and made the playoffs for the first time since 2016.

“I obviously want to show significant improvement over last year, but I’m not going to make any specific guarantees or demands or anything like that,” Mara said Thursday after a joint news conference with Hackensack Meridian Health.

“They know what I want to see,” Mara said 100 years to the day his grandfather, Tim, founded the Giants for a $500 investment.

“I have a lot of confidence in this particular team (Daboll and Schoen). Their communication is great. I think we’ve added some good pieces. Now it’s time to show everybody.”

There is a lot of optimism heading into this season. The Giants have revamped an offensive line that allowed a franchise-record 85 sacks last season and hired a new line coach in Carmen Bricillo. The receiving group is deep and talented, especially with first-round draft pick Malik Nabers and second-year pro Jalin Hyatt making big plays every practice.

Quarterback Daniel Jones has recovered quickly from an ACL injury in November. Running back Devin Singletary has looked good taking over for Saquon Barkley, who signed with the Eagles as a free agent.

There are more questions on the defense but the front seven looks good with Pro Bowl tackle Dexter Lawrence in the middle with bookend edge rushers Kayvon Thibodeaux and Brian Burns. Leading tackler and inside linebacker Bobby Okereke is back.

Mara has a competitive side. He’s like the fans of his team. They want a title and so does he. The Giants won their fourth Super Bowl in franchise history in February 2012.

It’s difficult to say how he will react if the Giants make the playoffs, but they still seem far away from a title.

“I don’t know how to quantify that,” Mara said of that possibility. “I want to walk off the field at the end of the season feeling like we are moving in the right direction, (like) we’ve got a great foundation here and there’s every reason to be optimistic moving forward.”

Mara spoke on a number of topics after a team mural commemorating the 100th season was unveiled on a wall outside the hospital. He said he had no regrets giving Jones a $160 million deal after the 2022 season.

“I thought he played really well for us in ’22,” Mara said of Jones. “Last year he got hurt. Now, let’s be honest, when he was playing we weren’t blocking anybody. So let’s give him a chance with a better offensive line with some weapons.”

Mara said he thought the team’s recent appearance on “Hard Knocks” went as well as could be expected. He added he was reluctant to appear on the show but eventually gave in.

He also said he left the decision on whether to re-sign Barkley up to Schoen, although he had long said the No. 2 overall pick in the 2018 draft was one of his favorite players, as well as a fan favorite.

Looking around the league, Mara said he was a bit surprised Bill Belichick was not hired after his run with the Patriots ended.

“I was very surprised, very surprised by that,” Mara said of the Giants defensive coordinator under Bill Parcells during the ’86 Super Bowl season. “You’re surprised every year by things that happen in the National Football League.”

a4cd81ee3d,The Guardian,Stakes high for European Union after arrest of Telegram co-founder - The Guardian,"The surprise arrest of the Russian-born co-founder of Telegram, Pavel Durov, after he stepped off his private jet in Paris last Saturday night, has brought the one-time fringe social network under the glare of the spotlight like never before.

Durov’s arrest – after an investigation by the Paris prosecutor into organised crime, child sex abuse images, fraud and money laundering on the platform – also raises the stakes for the European Union, which has adopted the world’s most ambitious laws to police the internet, notably the Digital Services Act (DSA). Coming into force in November 2022, the DSA targets online platforms “too big to care” – in the words of the EU commissioner, Thierry Breton – putting demands on internet firms to remove illegal content, protect children, tackle disinformation and other online harms.

The European Commission has kept its distance from the French investigation into Durov. “It is purely a criminal investigation at national level, carried out by the French authorities … based on French criminal law,” a spokesperson said. “It has nothing to do with the DSA.”

But the charges laid out against the 39-year-old tech billionaire increase pressure on the commission and Belgium, the member state responsible for regulating Telegram on behalf of the bloc. “If there is such a big problem with content moderation that it is actually criminally relevant … why hasn’t that been addressed under the DSA yet?” said Jan Penfrat at the European Digital Rights group (EDRi), a coalition of NGOs. “One possible answer is, of course, the DSA is new … but still it does create a kind of pressure on the authorities.”

The hybrid messaging service/social network, which has groups of users up to 200,000-strong, has worried European politicians for months. While Telegram has been favoured by pro-democracy activists in Russia, Hong Kong and Iran, it has also become a haven for extremists, criminals, conspiracy theorists and pro-Kremlin propagandists. In Lithuania, police have set up special units to monitor Telegram and other platforms in a bid to curb drug trafficking, while Dutch police told the country’s public broadcaster that it had had little cooperation from the platform after NOS journalists found 2.5m messages offering drugs on the site in 2023.

Based in the United Arab Emirates, Telegram has mushroomed to nearly a billion users worldwide while under limited regulation. But despite claiming only 41m active monthly users in the EU, it now faces new demands under European law.

Enforcement of the law could be a weak link in the chain. Belgium – along with five other EU member states – is subject to ongoing EU legal proceedings for failure to empower its “digital services coordinator”, the organisation responsible for enforcing the DSA. While the Belgian government has charged the Belgian Institute for Postal Services and Telecommunications to enforce the DSA, the agency lacks sufficient powers, meaning it is unable to launch investigations into Telegram.

Telegram, however, may come under direct purview of the EU executive. Until now it has not been subject to strictest regulation that only applies to the largest platforms, such as Meta’s Facebook and X, formerly known as Twitter. Under EU law only platforms with more than 45m monthly active users are “very large online platforms” [VLOPs] subject to the most stringent requirements, and direct supervision by the commission.

Senior EU officials are not convinced by Telegram’s claim to be just under the threshold, with 41m active monthly users in the EU. “Telegram is an issue,” Vĕra Jourová, a European Commission vice-president told Bloomberg in May. “We are now checking whether the figure is right,” she said, adding that “even the smallest platforms can do a very dangerous job in several member states”, referring to Telegram’s popularity in eastern EU countries with large Russian-speaking minorities.

The commission spokesperson said on Tuesday that it was “carefully analysing” Telegram’s figures, adding: “Once we will come to a clear conclusion, we will indeed not hesitate – if they meet the threshold – to designate Telegram [as a VLOP].”

Separate to these ongoing talks between the commission and Telegram, the platform must publish its latest monthly user data in the EU by the end of this month.

Telegram did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But after Durov’s arrest the company said it “abides by EU laws, including the Digital Services Act”.

Digital campaigners say Telegram needs to be much more transparent. “An online platform of that importance with that large user base, even if it isn’t officially designated a VLOP, is just way too important in order to operate with that level of opaqueness,” said Penfrat at EDRi.

“The public needs to know what’s going on and obviously regulators need to know in order to be able to do their job.”","A man stands on a stage with a microphone, wearing a black suit, with a blue background and the logo of 'The Guardian' visible.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BCA72D510>,2024-08-28 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/28/european-union-arrest-telegram-pavel-durov-law-analysis,['Technology' 'Politics' 'International'],[0.9  0.85 0.7 ],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/a4cd81ee3d.png
b8a08e3df9,The Associated Press,Lower your risk of falling as you get older with these simple steps - The Associated Press,"One in four older adults in the U.S. will fall each year, putting them at risk of injury, broken bones and even death.

Falls are a growing public health concern as the country’s population sees record numbers of people turn 65 — now and in the future. But common as falls may be, they are not inevitable.

“The more work we do, the more we realize that that healthy aging doesn’t have to include falling,” said Cara McDermott, who researches falls at Duke University School of Medicine.

Here are some recommendations on how to reduce your risk of falling.

Fall-proof your home

Start with how your house is set up: Consider removing small area rugs, change out dim lighting and don’t put pots and pans in hard-to-reach places.

Then, aim for providing extra stability in places where its easier to lose your balance. Install railings on both sides of the stairs, a grab bar in a bathroom and no-slip strips on wood or tile floors.

It’s also important to keep your home clean: Don’t leave items on the floor, and clean up spills before they dry up and become harder to deal with.

Consider using a walker or cane to keep you stable, but make sure it’s right for your height and that you know how to use it properly.

The National Institute on Aging has a full guide on its website with tips on how to fall-proof your home, room by room.

Exercise to build strength and balance

Go back to the basics with Newton’s first law: A body in motion stays in motion. That is, staying active can help prevent future issues — even if you’ve fallen before and are worried that it might happen again.

Many exercises that can help prevent falls, even if you have limited mobility, like chair yoga, tai chi and walking.

“It doesn’t mean that you have to go out and start running marathons or anything like that, but simply (do) functional exercises,” McDermott, said.

Make exercising fun and social by doing it with others in a group setting or playing with grandchildren.

The key: Know your limits and do what your doctor says is right for you.

Medications may increase your risk

Many medications can have side effects like light-headedness, sleepiness or other things that impair your balance.

McDermott said older adults should talk to their primary care doctor about all of the medications they are on — and how they may work in combination. A primary care doctor or pharmacist can see the whole picture and help find alternative medications that won’t throw you off balance.

But, she added, “I would never, ever recommend that somebody discontinue a medication without talking to their prescriber first.”

Stay on top of screenings

Changes in hearing, vision and other senses are common as you age and can contribute to falls. Make sure to have your hearing and vision tested regularly.

Bone health matters, too.

The Mayo Clinic estimates 10 million Americans have osteoporosis, which weakens the bones and makes it more likely to break something when you fall.

Taking Vitamin D and calcium can help improve bone health, and if needed, your doctor can test your bone density and recommend treatment.

Falls aren’t usually caused by one thing

Knowing that falls might be a combination of causes, do some of the previous suggestions to lower your risk.

And, if you do fall, let your doctor know — even if it seems minor. A fall can have wide-reaching implications and you’ll want to address the root cause to keep it from becoming a pattern.

“Maybe it is a one-time thing, but get it checked out anyway,” McDermott said.

c38eb14403,The Globe and Mail,Trudeau to tell allies to stay resolute as Ukraine to take centre of NATO summit - The Globe and Mail,"Canada will be reassuring allies of its commitment to the western alliance as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau travels to Washington this week to take part in the NATO leaders’ summit at a critical time for war-ravaged Ukraine.

The 32 NATO countries are set to mark the alliance’s 75th anniversary in the same city where the initial treaty was signed. Mr. Trudeau will be attending a dinner with NATO leaders at the White House hosted by Joe Biden as the age and mental acuity of the U.S. President is expected to cast a shadow over the historic meeting.

“All eyes are peering down into the U.S.,” said Ferry de Kerckhove, a former high-ranking Canadian diplomat.

The world will be watching to see how Mr. Biden handles the three-day summit after a widely panned performance during the recent presidential debate.

The upcoming election and the possibility of a second Donald Trump administration are looming concerns for the long-running defensive alliance. Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed he would not defend NATO members that don’t meet defence-spending targets.

Canada is one of those members but has defended itself repeatedly for not hitting the target.

Defence Minister Bill Blair points to NATO figures that show Canada’s defence spending grew 67 per cent between 2014 and 2021, and that, relative to its economy, that increased spending from 1 per cent of GDP to almost 1.4 per cent.

Canada is expected to spend 1.37 per cent this year, well below the target, but Mr. Blair has said that he expects spending to climb to at least 1.75 per cent by 2029 with additional spending for a new submarine fleet and integrated air defence and missile systems likely pushing the figure past 2 per cent.

The promises may not reassure Canada’s allies among worrying tensions with Russia, North Korea and China.

“Can we actually convince the people around the table and the Americans that we are going to chime in at the right time?” Mr. de Kerckhove said.

The continuing war in Ukraine will be front and centre and bilateral security agreements are expected to be signed. But the summit is unlikely to go as far as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hopes, said Aurel Braun, a professor of international relations and political science at the University of Toronto.

“This summit … could be an inflection point for Ukraine: What is NATO going to do?” Prof. Braun said.

A Canadian government official speaking on background said that Mr. Trudeau, who will be accompanied by Mr. Blair and Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly, will be making forceful comments about the need to stay resolute in backing Ukraine, as doubts about continuing the fight are growing in Europe and the United States.

NATO member countries have been spending the equivalent of $59-billion a year on military equipment for Ukraine since the war began in February, 2022. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Friday he expects heads of state and government will agree to a substantial package for Ukraine that will “constitute a bridge to NATO membership.”

Members have overwhelmingly provided support to Ukraine but are cautious not to be drawn into a wider conflict with Russia.

Hungary made an agreement last month not to veto NATO efforts at the coming summit to support Ukraine, as long as the region is not forced to help out.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban faced condemnation from Kyiv and some European leaders after a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow Friday where he said they discussed peace proposals for Ukraine.

Prof. Braun, who is also an associate with the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University, said he will be looking for more details on the promise from last year’s summit when NATO leaders agreed to fast-track Ukraine’s membership process. It is unlikely to become a reality for many years and Prof. Braun said Ukraine’s membership prospects may be linked to concessions that Mr. Zelensky may not be happy about.

“Are they offering a bridge or are they selling a bridge?” Prof. Braun asked.

Mr. Trudeau will also be using his time in Washington for other meetings in the city to bolster Team Canada efforts ahead of the U.S. election to ensure the government is prepared for any outcome. He will be meeting with Republican and Democrat politicians, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Mr. Trudeau, whose Liberals came to power in October, 2015, was criticized for being unprepared for the first Trump presidency after the 2016 U.S. election, and their relationship was notably rocky throughout the Republican leader’s four-year tenure.

Experts say meeting defence-funding targets will go a long way to strengthening the relationship with Canada’s largest trading partner.","A man in a suit walks past a podium with the NATO logo and a Canadian flag, with a blue background and multiple NATO logos.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x182 at 0x7D6BA58D4220>,2024-07-07 11:53:14.690000+00:00,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-trudeau-to-tell-allies-to-stay-resolute-as-ukraine-to-at-centre-of/,['Politics' 'International'],[0.9 0.9],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/c38eb14403.png

Points mean prizes

A stronger European Commission president, barricading the EU’s external borders, and taking over the agriculture portfolio. These are among the items on the wish list of the European People’s party (EPP), the victor of the EU elections, write Alice Hancock and Andy Bounds.

Context: The EPP won the largest share of the vote in the European parliament which will start sitting in mid-July. The centre-right group increased its number of seats by 10 to 186, with party officials expecting more will be added to its ranks in the coming days, as national parties decide which European political groups to join.

“We are the kingmaker,” EPP group chair lead Manfred Weber told the FT yesterday, after a meeting with leaders of the Socialists and Democrats, and the liberal Renew group. “To either left or right, there is no alternative option than to work with EPP”.

That would mean meeting key promises in the EPP’s manifesto, for example raising the number of Frontex officers to 30,000 to police the bloc’s external borders, and more “physical infrastructure” to halt migration.

But it would also mean a rethinking of the bloc’s landmark Green Deal climate policies. Weber promised that there would be “no step back” from its ambition of reaching net zero carbon emissions by mid-century, before adding: “We have to be pragmatic in the implementation.”

That could include reviewing an effective ban on combustion car engines from 2035 and giving polluting industries more leeway in the bloc’s emissions trading scheme.

On what jobs the EPP wants to secure, Weber was clear: “I would strengthen Ursula von der Leyen’s role as commission president.”

He added the EPP has “certain expectations” regarding the new commission. “I would not accept that the commissioner for agriculture goes to another party,” Weber said.

But before von der Leyen can choose her new commissioners, she needs to be appointed by EU leaders and then approved by the European parliament.

“From our side it’s clear,” Weber said. “We presented our candidate beforehand. We won the elections with our programme . . . now I simply ask the other democratic parties to accept this and to create stability for the next five years.”

Chart du jour: Crash test

Brussels is expected to announce tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles today after a surge in imports allegedly supported by unfair subsidies.

Defrosting

As G7 leaders begin to arrive in Puglia tonight, one topic on the agenda is agreeing further financial aid for Kyiv. But the EU is struggling to agree with a planned US-backed loan, and has instead come up with an alternative proposal to mobilise up to $50bn for Kyiv, writes Paola Tamma.

Context: The US proposed to issue a loan to Ukraine to be repaid from profits arising from Russian frozen assets, largely held in the EU. Given EU sanctions guaranteeing those profits need to be renewed every six months, the US plan would require the EU to indefinitely extend them, a change that would require unanimity. That’s something the EU isn’t prepared to do.

“To pay back the loans you would need the immobilised assets to remain immobilised . . . that’s not something that we can guarantee forever,” said an EU official.

Instead, EU officials are discussing an alternative scheme whereby each G7 member would issue a bilateral loan to Ukraine, reaching a combined amount of $50bn. The EU would be responsible for the largest portion of that — yet to be calculated — and would guarantee it with “headroom” from the EU budget, that is, the difference between what EU countries committed to pay and planned expenditure.

EU officials believe this circumvents, both the requirement for approval from national parliaments, as well as a unanimous decision by the 27 member states.

“The solution will be EU-centred because the Russian assets are immobilised in Europe,” said the EU official. “The model we are working on might not require unanimity when it comes to contracting a loan.”

911ee18154,CNN,US sues to split up Ticketmaster and Live Nation in a groundbreaking monopoly lawsuit - CNN,"In a groundbreaking antitrust lawsuit that threatens to upend the way concertgoers pay for tickets, the US government and dozens of states sued Live Nation on Thursday, alleging that for years the parent company of Ticketmaster abused its industry dominance to harm fans nationwide.

The long-expected suit, filed in New York by the Justice Department and 30 state and district attorneys general, challenges the country’s biggest ticketing website and concert promoter, which regulators allege was the mastermind of a plan to stifle competition. The governments are seeking a jury trial and a breakup of the company.

If successful, the case could lead to sweeping changes in the market for live events – an industry that came under intense scrutiny in 2022 after glitches at Ticketmaster blocked millions from purchasing tickets for Taylor Swift’s “Eras” tour.

For many critics of Live Nation, the Swift debacle revealed how a lack of competition has led to harms ranging from poor customer service to confusing pricing to expensive ticketing fees to restrictions on ticket resales — amounting to what many consumers complain of as death by a thousand cuts.

But fans hoping to save money aren’t yet out of the woods, as the suit will likely take years to make its way through the court system. Meanwhile, the exorbitant fees they know all too well aren’t likely to be dramatically affected.

In a statement, Live Nation called the DOJ’s allegations “baseless.”

“The DOJ’s lawsuit won’t solve the issues fans care about relating to ticket prices, service fees, and access to in-demand shows,” Live Nation said in a statement. “Calling Ticketmaster a monopoly may be a PR win for the DOJ in the short term, but it will lose in court because it ignores the basic economics of live entertainment.”

Unlike some of the other businesses DOJ has sued, Live Nation does not reap enormous profits from its market position, the company added.

“Live Nation’s net profit margin last fiscal year was 1.4% - nowhere near other DOJ targets in the tech sector,” the company said in a statement, noting Apple and Google – both subjects of the Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuits, have margins north of 24%.

Shares of Live Nation (LYV) fell 5% on the news.

Not just frustrating … it’s illegal, DOJ says

Attorney General Merrick Garland in a press conference Thursday rattled off a seemingly endless list of fees Ticketmaster charges customers. “Those include: ticketing fees, service fees, convenience fees, platinum fees, per-order fees, handling fees and payment processing fees, among others.”

But Garland noted the annoyance isn’t why the Justice Department sued.

“We’re here not because Ticketmaster’s conduct is inconvenient or frustrating … we’re here because it’s illegal,” Garland said.

Prosecutors allege that Live Nation’s end game was to monopolize the ticketing and live events industry by cutting exclusive deals with the country’s largest venues, ensuring that all their future events were ticketed through the company’s platform.

According to the lawsuit, Live Nation directly manages more than 400 artists, controls around 60% of concert promotions at major concert venues across the country, and controls more than 265 concert venues in North America. And through Ticketmaster, the suit says, Live Nation controls roughly 80% or more of major concert venues’ primary ticketing for concerts.

“We allege that Live Nation relies on unlawful, anticompetitive conduct to exercise its monopolistic control over the live events industry in the United States at the cost of fans, artists, smaller promoters, and venue operators,” said Garland in a statement. “The result is that fans pay more in fees, artists have fewer opportunities to play concerts, smaller promoters get squeezed out, and venues have fewer real choices for ticketing services. It is time to break up Live Nation-Ticketmaster.”

Bad blood

Musicians, too, have complained of Live Nation’s tightly integrated operation, which combines event ticketing services with control of roughly 200 popular US venues, a linkage that critics say allows the company to dictate terms and fees to artists.

Reacting in 2022 to the Ticketmaster fiasco that enraged her fans, Swift wrote on Instagram that the situation was “excruciating for me” and “pisses me off.”

The company also has bad blood with several other artists who have taken aim at Live Nation’s practices, including The Cure front man Robert Smith, who said he was “sickened” by Ticketmaster’s fees, and country singer Zach Bryan, who in 2022 released a collection of live performances entitled “All My Homies Hate Ticketmaster (Live at Red Rocks).”

Garland in his press conference talked about his personal experience going to a Bonnie Raitt concert in high school and seeing Bruce Springsteen as a warmup act.

“We all knew we had just seen the future of rock and roll,” he mused. “The Justice Department filed this lawsuit for fans who should be able to go to concerts without a monopoly standing in their way.”

Ticketmaster competitors were pleased by the lawsuit.

“For nearly fifteen years, the Ticketmaster and Live Nation monopoly has ignored the fan experience: fans have been limited to a singular platform only to suffer through a consumer experience that fails them repeatedly,” StubHub said in a statement. “We hope it creates a healthier ticketing market, one that empowers competition, drives innovation, and places the fan experience at the forefront.”

An unpopular merger

Now, the US government is opposing Live Nation’s economic power for the first time since the company merged with Ticketmaster in 2010. Regulators chose to tolerate it at the time; rather than sue to block the deal, they imposed certain obligations on the company meant to anticipate potential harms that the merger might cause.

The lawsuit will likely be cheered by antitrust advocates who say they knew the Live Nation-Ticketmaster merger was trouble from the start. Among the deal’s critics are US lawmakers including Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who as far back as 2019 were calling on the Justice Department to investigate Live Nation for not living up to its commitments. Klobuchar, Blumenthal and a number of other senators including Texas Republican Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz have proposed numerous bills to regulate the ticketing industry.

“The Justice Department is doing the right thing today by seeking to break up this monopoly that has long harmed fans, artists, and venues,” Klobuchar said in a statement. “In addition to holding Live Nation accountable, I’ve also fought to create common sense guardrails to promote healthy competition in the ticketing market, and I will continue to work towards passing my bipartisan legislation that would do just that.”

The lawsuit highlights how regulators now believe, more than a decade on, that the behavioral modifications Live Nation agreed to have failed. Those claims dovetail with a wider push by the Biden administration ramping up antitrust enforcement across the entire economy, with officials blaming decades of lax enforcement for a wave of consolidation and a reduction in consumer power.

The request for a jury trial is unusual: Recent antitrust lawsuits have asked for a judge to rule, because they can be long and get into complicated law.

The list of states and districts participating in Thursday’s suit includes Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming and the District of Columbia, according to the court docket in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York.

“For too long, Live Nation and Ticketmaster have unfairly and illegally run the world of live events, abusing their dominance to overcharge fans, bully venues, and limit artists,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James in a statement. “Everybody agrees, Live Nation and Ticketmaster are the problem and it’s time for a new era.”

f93bb2ea59,The Globe and Mail,Simone Biles makes her Olympic return in Paris in powerful form - The Globe and Mail,"For a nerve-racking moment, it looked as though Simone Biles’s triumphant return to Olympic competition was over before it began.

After delivering a stunning beam routine at Bercy Arena on Sunday in the women’s gymnastics qualifying event, Biles appeared to tweak her left lower calf muscle during the floor warm-up.

Team USA’s medical staff taped up her leg and ankle, but Biles could still be seen gently limping and hopping – even briefly crawling off the vault runway. (Cécile Landi, one of Biles’s coaches, later told reporters it was an injury Biles felt a couple of weeks ago.)

But to those who worried about a repeat of the Tokyo Games, when Biles was forced to withdraw during a vault routine after suffering a case of the “twisties” – a phenomenon in which an athlete loses their sense of where they are in the air – the GOAT revealed she had other plans.

Biles delivered a powerful but not-quite-perfect floor routine, which still earned the high score of the night. She then followed it up with an electrifying “Biles II” vault that garnered an astronomical 15.8 score. This double pike manoeuvre is the sport’s most difficult vault and it’s named after her, as Biles is the only woman to have performed it in international competition.

The 27-year-old, who already has five eponymous skills, was hoping to add a sixth at this Games, but when the time came during her uneven-bars portion, Biles played it safe.

Still, the international crowd jumped to its feet as one of the most accomplished athletes in the world completed her Olympic return.

Biles, who is a four-time Olympic gold medalist – and also holds 23 world titles – comfortably led the women’s group with a total score of 59.566. She will advance to the all-around competition, and in three of the four apparatuses; she just missed the uneven bars qualifier.

Meanwhile, Team Canada achieved one of its major Olympic goals in qualifying for the team event, which will be held on Tuesday, after placing sixth with a score of 161.563. The Canadian women’s team hasn’t competed in the team final in 12 years.

The United States finished first with 172.296, more than five points ahead of second-place Italy.

Team veteran Ellie Black will be advancing to the individual all-around competition with her teammate Ava Stewart, 18, of Bowmanville, Ont. Black also qualified to advance in the vault apparatus alongside Shallon Olsen, a 24-year-old from Surrey, B.C.

This is Black’s fourth Games and with that experience, the 28-year-old Halifax native has been acting as a mentor to her younger teammates, two of whom – Cassie Lee of Toronto and Aurélie Tran of Repentigny, Que. – are making their Olympic debut.

“Before they went out today, though, they had a little moment in the back room and I could literally see the sparkle in their eyes about being at the Olympic Games. That was heartwarming to me because that’s what it’s all about,” Black said. “It’s about being here, reaching that goal, and there are only five girls in Canada who get to do that.”

It was a packed house at Bercy Arena on Sunday, with celebrities such as Lady Gaga, Snoop Dogg and Tom Cruise showing up to cheer on Biles.

Even the International Olympic Committee recognized that Sunday was all about Simone Biles, who is arguably this Games’ biggest star. At the daily media briefing, officials acknowledged that the day marked her return and they wished her well – a fitting moment given that the bulk of the IOC’s presentation centred on its efforts to properly elevate women and women’s sport.

Paris has styled itself as the first Olympic Games to achieve parity between men and women.

“Gender equality has been mainstreamed throughout everything,” said Marie Sallois, who runs the IOC’s sustainability strategy.

From the symbolic moments – such as having two flag bearers, a man and woman, light the cauldron – to the hard numbers, officials said there is gender parity among volunteers, Games’ staff and executives, and the number of competitive spots allocated for male and female athletes. (The IOC said it can’t yet give the exact breakdown of men to women athletes, because of “variables in the qualification systems” with different federations and national Olympic committees.)

Even the schedule has been created through a gender lens. In the past, in a team sport final, the women’s team has gone first, while the men get the finale, said Yiannis Exarchos, the Olympic executive who deals with broadcasting rights. At the Paris Games, organizers will be mixing it up.

It’s a policy that is long overdue, he said, and it comes at a time when some of the biggest storylines in sport centre on women athletes.

For 11-year-old Nyla Easterling, who came to Paris from Texas with her parents Adrian and Latori to cheer on Team USA, there are no bigger stars than Biles and her teammates.

“I’m a Level 7 gymnast and I love to watch Simone and [American gymnast] Jordan Chiles,” she said.

Easterling and her parents were bedecked in matching custom T-shirts that had been emblazoned with images of Team USA, with Biles, of course, positioned front and centre.","A gymnast in a silver leotard performs a mid-air flip, with her left leg extended and arms outstretched.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BCA81CD60>,2024-07-29 00:09:53.542000+00:00,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/olympics/article-simone-biles-makes-her-olympic-return-in-paris-in-powerful-form/,['Sports' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Unlikely,Likely,sample_review/images/f93bb2ea59.png
da6a805499,Financial Times,Why the ECB is more focused on risks than recovery - Financial Times,"Good morning. News to start: Brussels is drawing up plans to impose customs duties on cheap goods ordered from Chinese retailers including Temu and Shein, in an effort to stem a surge in substandard items flooding Europe’s mailboxes.

Today, our man at the ECB’s away days in Portugal takes the temperature of the EU’s economy. And I explain why Ursula von der Leyen is skipping next week’s Nato summit to bolster support for her re-election.

Frank Sintra

At this week’s annual conference of the European Central Bank in Sintra, president Christine Lagarde played golf with US Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell and the governors of the German and Canadian central banks. Canada’s Tiff Macklem won thanks to his long drive but Powell gave him a good run; Lagarde was surprisingly sharp around the greens.

And the chatter at the luxury resort in the south of Portugal was not just about the hazards on the golf course — ECB officials were clear about the many risks that lurk on the horizon, writes Martin Arnold.

Context: Eurozone inflation fell from 2.6 per cent in May to 2.5 per cent, data from Eurostat showed yesterday, supporting the ECB decision to cut interest rates last month based on forecasts that price growth will fall to its 2 per cent target next year.

The Eurozone economy expanded 0.3 per cent in the first quarter — ending almost a year of stagnation — and unemployment remained at an all-time low of 6.4 per cent in May.

One of the biggest risks looming is that the world economy is heading for a period of protectionism, especially if Donald Trump wins November’s US presidential election.

Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius gave a presentation spelling out how Trump’s promise to increase tariffs on imports from the EU by 10 per cent would hit the Eurozone economy disproportionately hard — predicting it would knock 1 per cent off GDP in the bloc, while shaving only 0.1 per cent off US GDP.

Another worry for Eurozone rate-setters is fiscal policy, particularly the risk that the French election produces a far-right government which embarks on a spending spree that puts it on a collision course with investors, destroys credibility in the EU’s recently revamped fiscal rules and pushes up inflation.

“Fiscal matters enormously,” ECB president Christine Lagarde told delegates yesterday, adding that rate-setters were “very concerned” about the need for governments to bring their deficits in line with the EU’s 3 per cent limit.

The final worry is that inflation is yet to be completely tamed because wages are still rising at about 5 per cent a year, pushing up costs for labour intensive services companies that are passing this on to consumers via higher prices.

“We have to look what is behind it, which is a lot of labour costs,” Lagarde said.

Chart du jour: Endgame

Almost two and a half years since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Europeans have widely diverging views on how the conflict will — or should — end, according to a survey by the European Council on Foreign Relations published today.

Whip it real good

Ursula von der Leyen will skip next week’s Nato summit to instead convince a maximum number of lawmakers to vote for her in the European parliament, amid nerves inside her camp about her coalition’s solidity.

Context: Von der Leyen wants a second term as European Commission president. She won support of EU leaders last week. Now she needs 361 votes in the parliament, with a vote scheduled for July 18.

Von der Leyen’s European People’s party (EPP) and her coalition partners, the Socialists and Democrats (S&D) and liberal Renew, boast 399 MEPs. But defections are historically high in the secret ballot.

Party officials are confident they have struck a deal with French EPP members who had previously threatened to withhold their votes. On Monday, von der Leyen also met with the Green party (54 seats) to discuss potential external support.

But skipping the Nato gathering is seen as necessary to expand the list of trusty backers. European Commission spokesman Eric Mamer said von der Leyen would instead be focusing “on her work to build a majority for a strong Europe in the European parliament”.

“The 13th floor is tied up 24/7 hitting the phones,” said one commission official, referring to the top floor of the Berlaymont building where von der Leyen’s office is based.

“Some people might say to your face that they will vote for you, but you can’t be sure,” said one person briefed on the negotiations. “You want to make sure that there’s a buffer. Nobody wants to lose by three votes.”

Von der Leyen attended the last two Nato summits in Vilnius and Madrid, as a guest of the alliance. EU Council president Charles Michel and chief diplomat Josep Borrell will represent the bloc next week.

a83dfefab7,CNN,Stakes are high for prosecutors to rescue Cohen testimony as Trump trial enters endgame - CNN,"The biggest questions as Donald Trump’s first criminal trial resumes Monday are whether his attorneys have destroyed the credibility of star witness Michael Cohen — and how much of the damage prosecutors can fix.

The presumptive GOP presidential nominee is due back in court amid clear signs the hush money trial is drawing toward a close — unless he takes the risky decision to testify in his own defense, a step that would lengthen and complicate the proceedings.

Defense lawyers say they expect to complete their bruising cross-examination of Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer and enforcer, on Monday morning. Prosecutors will then use their second chance to question Cohen to try to patch up any doubts the ex-president’s team may have sown in the minds of jurors about his version of events.

New York state prosecutors allege Trump broke the law by falsifying financial records to cover up a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. This, they say, was to deceive voters in 2016 in an early example of election interference. Trump denies having an affair with Daniels and has pleaded not guilty.

In dramatic testimony, Cohen last week directly implicated Trump in the alleged scheme, saying the former president directed him to hand over $130,000 to Daniels and promised him reimbursement. “Just do it,” Cohen said in describing his boss’s alleged order to make the payment — insisting that Trump was worried the story could doom his campaign.

But in a critical moment under cross-examination, Cohen appeared to trip up over an account of a call he’d previously said under oath was to discuss the payment. But the call, at least to begin with, appeared to be about another matter entirely.

Trump attorney Todd Blanche produced a text from before the call that Cohen sent to bodyguard Keith Schiller, who was with Trump at the time, in which Cohen said he wanted help dealing with a 14-year-old who was prank calling him. He didn’t mention Daniels in the text despite later testifying that the purpose of the call was to discuss the situation surrounding her. “That was a lie!” Blanche declared, leading Cohen to insist: “I believe I also spoke to President Trump and told him everything regarding the Stormy Daniels matter was being worked on and it’s going to be resolved.”

The defense is also trying to portray Cohen as being obsessed with bringing Trump down and has brought up a stream of insults he flung the ex-president’s way on social media and television, including when he called Trump a “Cheeto-dusted cartoon villain.”

Cohen has long been seen as a potentially problematic witness, given his record of falsehoods and his own conviction — for events related to the hush money payment and for other offenses including lying to Congress. The prosecution, therefore, built a structure of testimony before he took the stand, including from former associates of the ex-president, to try to corroborate what he would say. But they apparently did not foresee everything, including the text exchange with Schiller.

In their redirect examination, therefore, prosecutors are likely to try to mitigate Cohen’s testimony about the call. But if jurors think Cohen lied about the content of the call with Schiller and about whether he spoke to Trump, they could begin to doubt other aspects of his testimony. “That is exactly what the judge will instruct the jury: ‘If you find anything that a witness said to be untrue, to be incredible, to be a lie, feel free to disregard the entirety of that witness’s testimony,’” Randy Zelin, a trial attorney and adjunct professor at Cornell Law School, said on “CNN News Central” on Friday.

Trump’s lawyers need to create reasonable doubt in the minds of just one juror to open the possibility of a hung jury or an acquittal.

Questions mount over scope of defense case

Scrutiny of Cohen’s testimony was the latest twist in the presumptive Republican nominee’s multifront legal saga, which includes three other criminal indictments and has meant the path to the 2024 election has run more through the courts than the campaign trail. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him — in two cases related to his attempt to overturn the 2020 election and one over his hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort. And he’s rooted his bid to reclaim the White House in claims of political persecution.

There is no evidence that Trump is the victim of a coordinated attempt by President Joe Biden to weaponize the justice system against his rival, despite such claims by a parade of Republican lawmakers flocking to the Manhattan court in recent days. The most prominent visitor was House Speaker Mike Johnson, who brought the symbolism of his office to bear in an extraordinary attack on the judge and the case. The Louisiana Republican also attempted to discredit Cohen, joining fellow Republicans in bolstering Trump’s own attacks after the judge threatened the ex-president with jail if he continued to infringe on a limited gag order.

With the end of Cohen’s testimony looming, there is uncertainty over the extent of Trump’s defense case. His attorneys have said they may call at least one witness — Bradley Smith, a former commissioner of the Federal Election Commission. Judge Juan Merchan indicated Thursday that he was reluctant to change limits he has already placed on the scope of any such testimony. Merchan has ruled Smith could discuss the role and function of the FEC and define certain terms related to campaign finance but cannot say whether the law was violated in this case.

The greatest unknown — apart from the verdict — is whether Trump will take the stand

There are many reasons why testimony from the accused is often viewed as risky for the defense in any case. But when the defendant is as difficult to control and prone to assaulting the truth as the former president, the stakes are even higher. Trump initially said he would testify — as he often threatens to do in his legal dramas — but then appeared to backtrack by falsely claiming a gag order in the case designed to protect witnesses and court staff meant he could not.

Blanche referred to the possibility of Trump’s testimony on Thursday, the last day the court was in session. “That’s another decision that we need to think through,” Blanche said. After days on the defensive, Trump’s attorneys may have finally succeeded in making the credibility of Cohen an important factor in the trial last week. But an appearance by Trump could be a massive distraction from Cohen’s problems. It could also open up the former president to being probed on inconsistencies in his own story. And Trump may be asked about details of the alleged liaison with Daniels in Lake Tahoe in 2006 that he denies took place.

Trump has often left no doubt that he considers himself his own best advocate. Throughout his business career and political life, he has been notoriously impossible for subordinates to control. During this trial, he has used breaks in courtroom action to address reporters to shape public perceptions of the case because there are no television cameras in court. The temptation to take the most critical turn in his own trial — and to try to create even more of a political circus than he has already — may be irresistible.

Trump did take the stand in a civil fraud case against him, his adult sons, and his business organization in November. The judge in that trial, Arthur Engoron, tried initially to keep Trump under control, but the testimony soon turned into a replica of the ex-president’s unchained campaign trial rhetoric, much to the judge’s frustration. And Trump’s histrionics appear to have harmed him as Engoron wrote in a civil judgment against Trump worth nearly half a billion dollars that the ex-president and his sons showed a complete lack of contrition and remorse for massive frauds that bordered on the “pathological.” The critical difference in the hush money criminal case is that it will be adjudicated by a jury and not a judge.

After the defense case wraps up, the prosecution has a chance to put on its own rebuttal. Next come the summations of the case from prosecutors and the defense — a process Merchan said he hopes to begin as early as Tuesday.

Then, the lawyers leave the stage, and the judge instructs members of the jury on the law they must apply in their deliberations. It is at that point, when the jurors retire to consider their verdict, that the country will be in suspense, waiting for the unprecedented moment when it will learn whether, for the first time, a former president will be convicted of a crime.","A painting of Donald Trump and a man in a suit, with a striped background, possibly representing a courtroom scene.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA0E35C30>,2024-05-20 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/20/politics/michael-cohen-testimony-trump-trial/index.html,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.9 ],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/a83dfefab7.png
f16668b9a7,CBS News,"University of Michigan didn't suitably gauge if Israel-Hamas war protests made campus hostile, US says - CBS News","The University of Michigan did not adequately investigate if campus protests in response to the Israel-Hamas war and other incidents created a hostile environment for students, faculty and staff, according to the results of investigations by the U.S. Education Department announced Monday.

The agreements are the first investigations to reach a conclusion among dozens launched by the Education Department since Oct. 7, the day Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel. The agency also found similar issues with how the City University of New York handled protests on their grounds.

The department's Office of Civil Rights investigated 75 instances of alleged discrimination and harassment at the University of Michigan based on shared Jewish ancestry and shared Palestinian or Muslim ancestry. The investigation found that the university's responses did not meet its Title VI requirements to remedy the hostile environment.

In one instance, when a Jewish student reported being called out for viewing a graduate student instructor's social media post about pro-Palestinian topics, the university told the student that ""formal conflict resolution is not a path forward at this time,"" because the incident occurred on social media.

In another instance, when a student who participated in a pro-Palestinian protest was called a ""terrorist,"" the university said it held ""restorative circles"" to address the incident but did not take further action.

In its resolution agreement, the University of Michigan agreed to administer a climate assessment, implement additional training and revise its policies as necessary. It also agreed to monitoring by the Office of Civil Rights through the end of the 2026 school year, reporting its responses to future incidents of discrimination to the department.

A number of other incidents were reported on and around campus late in the school year. In mid-May, university officials said the student groups who had organized an encampment on campus took responsibility for protesting at Board of Regents members' homes, leaving fake body bags painted with what appeared to be fake blood.

At one of the university's graduation ceremonies, dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters briefly interrupted the proceedings. The protesters were wearing kaffiyeh and graduation caps, and unfurled Palestinian flags and posters as they walked through the aisles. They marched toward the stage chanting: ""Regents, regents, you can't hide! You are funding genocide!"" A plane was also spotted flying over the ceremony with a banner that said: ""Divest from Israel now! Free Palestine.""

Neither the University of Michigan nor CUNY immediately responded to requests for comment on the investigations' results on Monday.

Protests rocked many campuses in final weeks of the school year

Complaints of antisemitism and Islamophobia have led to inquiries at more than 100 universities and school districts, including Harvard and Yale, community colleges and public schools from Los Angeles to suburban Minneapolis.

The complaints vary widely but all accuse schools of violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national origin. Colleges and schools are required to protect students from discrimination, and when they don't, the Education Department can invoke penalties up to termination of federal money.

Protests over the Israel-Hamas war upended the final weeks of the school year at many campuses across the country, with some cancelling graduation ceremonies or moving classes online after Pro-Palestinian protesters set up encampments in campus spaces.

The protests have tested schools as they aim to balance free speech rights and the safety of students. The Education Department has issued guidance detailing schools' responsibilities around Title VI, but the results of the agency's investigations could provide a clearer line showing where political speech crosses into harassment.

Finding that boundary has been a struggle for colleges as they grapple with rhetoric that has different meaning to different people. Some chants commonly used by pro-Palestinian activists are seen by some as antisemitic, including ""from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"" and ""intifada revolution.""

Meanwhile, some complaints say Arab and Muslim students have faced abuses only to be ignored by campus officials. At Harvard, the Education Department is investigating separate complaints, one over alleged antisemitism and the other over alleged Islamophobia.

""Hate has no place on our college campuses — ever,"" Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in a statement. ""Sadly, we have witnessed a series of deeply concerning incidents in recent months. There's no question that this is a challenging moment for school communities across the country.""

More investigations are expected to be resolved in the coming weeks, but Cardona said his agency is struggling to keep up with the influx of cases.

Republicans have rejected requests to increase money for the Office for Civil Rights in recent years, while the average case load increased to 42 per investigator in 2023. Without more money, that figure could increase to more than 70 cases per investigator, Cardona has said.

""We are desperately in need of additional support to make sure we can investigate the cases that we have in front of us,"" Cardona told members of the House in May.

On average, cases take about six to eight months to resolve. The vast majority of the agency's civil rights investigations end with voluntary resolutions. Schools usually promise to resolve any lingering problems and take steps to protect students in the future.

While the Education Department investigates, several colleges and school districts have separately been called before Congress to answer allegations of antisemitism. Republicans have held a series of hearings on the issue, grilling leaders accused of tolerating antisemitism.","A large crowd of graduates in caps and gowns, some holding a Palestinian flag, at a graduation ceremony with a banner reading 'M COMMISSIONING OF ROTC M' in the background.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BDA730940>,2024-06-17 16:29:51+00:00,https://www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/university-michigan-protests-israel-hamas-war-hostile-campus-education-department/,['Politics' 'National' 'Other'],[0.85 0.75 0.6 ],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/f16668b9a7.png
7d34cda8b9,Newsmax,Social Conservatives Push Trump on Federal Role for Abortion - Newsmax,"A leading anti-abortion group on Tuesday warned Republican presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump not to water down language in the party platform on abortion ahead of the Republican National Convention.

The statement by Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America president Marjorie Dannenfelser comes as party members head to Milwaukee to draft the platform, which serves as a statement of policy principles, ahead of what is intended to be a national show of unity at the party's convention this month.

For weeks, anti-abortion activists have been expressing concerns that the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee would work to weaken language in the platform by eliminating any reference to a federal role in restricting abortion.

Trump has said the issue should be left solely to state legislatures in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2022 that gutted constitutional protection for the procedure. He has argued that is a more politically tenable position, with polls showing a majority of Americans broadly backing abortion rights.

In a statement on Tuesday, Dannenfelser said the longtime, battle-tested alliance between the grassroots anti-abortion movement and the Republican, or GOP, Party was in jeopardy.

""If the Trump campaign decides to remove national protections for the unborn in the GOP platform, it would be a miscalculation that would hurt party unity and destroy pro-life enthusiasm between now and the election,"" Dannenfelser said.

Members of the Republican Party's platform committee are scheduled to meet privately in Milwaukee ahead of the July 15-18 convention, where Trump will be formally tapped as the party's presidential nominee for the Nov. 5 election against President Joe Biden, a Democrat who is campaigning in favor of abortion rights.

In her statement, Dannenfelser suggested that anti-abortion groups were being shut out of the process of crafting the platform.

""We are now just two business days away from the platform committee meeting and no assurances have been made,"" she said. ""Instead, every indication is that the campaign will muscle through changes behind closed doors.""

Danielle Alvarez, a spokesperson for the Trump campaign, said no definitive decisions had been made on the platform's contents.

""The platform committee has yet to convene to discuss what language should be in the final document,"" Alvarez said. She did not respond to questions about whether the anti-abortion groups have a say in the process.

EVANGELICAL PRESSURE

Last month, a bevy of anti-abortion advocates, including prominent evangelical Christians such as Ralph Reed and Tony Perkins, sent a letter to Trump sharing concerns similar to Dannenfelser's.

They called on the campaign to ensure that language be retained in the platform that explicitly says a fetus has a ""fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed."" They have also urged passage of federal legislation to grant protection to fetuses under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which outlines the rights of U.S. citizens, and want a further so-called ""human life amendment"" added to the Constitution.

Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council who served as an evangelical adviser to Trump's administration, has launched an online ""platform integrity project"" to apply grassroots pressure to Trump and party leaders to keep the current abortion language.

A member of the RNC platform committee, Perkins sent a letter to RNC Chair Michael Whatley on Monday complaining that advocates and the media would be shut out of the platform deliberations under a ""gag rule"" imposed by the party.

""The RNC Gag Rule heightens speculation that the GOP platform will be watered down to a few pages of meaningless, poll-tested talking points,"" Perkins wrote.

The Trump campaign in a memo last month to the platform committee urged that it boil down the document to a statement of basic tenets absent of ""Washington jargon"" and the ""shackles of lobbyist influence.""

While Trump relied on strong support from evangelicals during the Republican nominating contest, he has consistently maintained that an extreme stance on abortion hurts the party's electoral chances and has frowned upon six-week bans like those passed by states such as Florida.

He has argued that his appointment of three Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn the seminal abortion case Roe v. Wade stands as proof of his anti-abortion bona fides.","A woman stands at a podium with a microphone, wearing a brown blazer and a necklace, with a blue background featuring the 'Advancing America' logo.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x187 at 0x7D6BA2F8B820>,2024-07-02 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.newsmax.com,https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/sba-dannenfelser-perkins/2024/07/02/id/1171039/,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/7d34cda8b9.png
bcf9606404,Newsweek,Ted Cruz Faces Second Investigation in Less Than a Year - Newsweek,"Texas Senator Ted Cruz faces a second investigation in less than a year as two advocacy groups called on the Federal Election Commission (FEC) on Tuesday to investigate Cruz for more than $630,000 in advertising revenue that has gone from his podcast to a super PAC backing his reelection. Concerns have been raised over iHeartMedia, the broadcaster of the Verdict With Ted Cruz podcast, paying $630,850 to the Truth and Courage PAC which supports the Republican Senator. The complaint comes as Cruz is expected to face a tough election challenge in November from Democrat Colin Allred, a former NFL player who currently serves in the House of Representatives. In 2018, Cruz only narrowly defeated Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke by less than three percent of the vote, and his seat is widely regarded as competitive in 2024. Data from the FEC shows iHeartMedia has donated a total of $630,850 to Truth and Courage PAC since March 2023, constituting around a third of its revenue since the beginning of that year. Critics are calling on Senate and federal election authorities to investigate this as a possible ethics violation while Cruz's team has said he has done nothing wrong. On Tuesday, the Campaign Legal Center and End Citizens United filed a FEC complaint that focuses on campaign finance rules as it alleges Cruz may have improperly directed iHeartMedia to send over $630,000 to the Truth and Courage PAC.

""By soliciting or directing $630,850.08 of iHeartMedia's corporate funds to or on behalf of TCP in connection with his 2024 election, Cruz appears to have brazenly violated these federal campaign finance laws,"" the complaint reads. While the terms of iHeartMedia's payments are unclear as the company's agreement with Cruz for distributing his podcast is not public, Cruz and iHeart have previously said the senator volunteers to host the podcast three times a week and is not compensated. The Cruz campaign has previously said the attention to the podcast's financial arrangements is ""lazy attacks"" by news outlets and Democrats trying to shut down the podcast in an election year. Cruz previously faced a similar investigation when in September 2023 the FEC found Cruz did not violate the law prohibiting the use of campaign funds for personal gain when his campaign bought Facebook ads in 2020 to tout his book. The decision came after in April 2023, the FEC found ""reason to believe"" that Cruz used $13,900 in campaign funds for his personal benefit by purchasing ads to promote his book. However, three weeks later Cruz's attorneys provided the commission with an affidavit stating that the senator did not benefit financially from any sales those ads may have generated. Cruz started hosting the podcast during former President Donald Trump's first impeachment trial in early 2020. The senator announced iHeart's backing in 2022, saying at the time that it was a ""big damn deal"" to partner with the radio programmer.","A man in a dark suit stands at a podium with a microphone, speaking into it.

19813b0bd1,Financial Times,Labour’s public sector pay deals were a no-brainer but come with risks - Financial Times,"Good morning. As some of you pointed out, there were some glaring omissions in yesterday’s newsletter: £9.4bn to be precise. That’s the amount that Rachel Reeves has opted to spend on honouring the recommendations of the independent pay review bodies, the biggest single unfunded pressure in the previous government’s spending plans, which I did not mention.

I did that for a reason: I think the policy and politics of public sector pay are a sufficiently big deal that they need to be considered on their own, which is why they are the topic of today’s note.

Pay in blood

The Labour government has opted to make two expensive choices when it comes to public sector pay. The first is to offer junior doctors a salary rise of 22 per cent over two years to end the strikes. As there are not that many junior doctors, this is not that expensive: about £1bn. The second is to accept the recommendation of the independent pay review bodies to hand public sector workers a pay increase of 5 to 6 per cent. This is much more expensive, coming in at £9.4bn this year, though they are of course linked, in that the offer made to junior doctors shapes expectations about what you pay elsewhere.

In policy terms, this is not hard to defend. One of the things that the NHS does well compared with other healthcare systems is suppress the wages of the people who work in it. Because the NHS is a near-monopsony, it is able to suppress pay claims for pretty long periods.

That’s a big part of why public sector pay in the UK since the Conservatives took office looks like this:

I don’t want to insult our readers who work as teachers, but this is nuts! A maths teacher needs to be fluent in whatever language they teach in, be it English, French, Spanish or whatever. Your surgeon doesn’t. Doctors are geographically mobile and they have many more options. It is frankly remarkable that the UK has been able to oversee such significant reductions in the pay of doctors, both compared with other public sector workers in the UK but also to clinicians across the world for such a long time without the NHS facing greater pressures than it already does.

That’s the backdrop to the strikes that have marred the NHS in recent years, and the big retention problems that the UK’s healthcare system has experienced, too. Doctors are voting with their feet, particularly junior doctors who have done particularly poorly out of recent pay settlements, and are working abroad, particularly but not exclusively within the English speaking world.

Rishi Sunak’s failure to settle the strikes is a big part of why he lost — at least 8 per cent of people across the UK were waiting for an NHS operation at the time of the election. The single biggest thing within the control of the government that will shape the next election is whether the NHS waiting list has gone down, and you obviously can’t achieve that while there are ongoing strikes.

So, politically, settling the junior doctors dispute was a non-negotiable for the Labour government. That’s part of why Keir Starmer set Wes Streeting the deadline of reaching an agreement acceptable to both the Treasury and the BMA before the end of the parliamentary session, something he did with two days to spare.

But if you are doing that, you can’t then take the rare step of ignoring the independent pay review bodies for everyone else. So, in policy terms, finding the £9.4bn is a no-brainer. Sunak had tested the alternative to destruction and Starmer was not going to repeat the experiment.

Politically it comes with plenty of risks attached. It means that the government has given up an awful lot of its fiscal firepower not just this year but throughout the parliament.

Starmer and Reeves are betting that spending a pretty large chunk of their headroom against their fiscal rule on pay will ease the recruitment and retention challenges the government is facing across the public realm, and that the reform programmes of the various spending departments will help to deliver further improvements in outcomes on top.

If ministers succeed, then they will be able to go into the next election pointing to improved public services, with the electoral support of a good-sized chunk of grateful public sector workers. If they don’t, then the opposition will be able to argue that if the Labour government had held out longer it would have had more money for tax cuts or to spend elsewhere.

Now try this

I have just finished Slay the Princess, a brilliant and gory “visual novel” (this is what arthouse pseuds like myself call video games to make ourselves seem flashier) that tells the story of an unnamed hero sent to kill a princess who threatens to destroy the world. What results is a brilliantly bloody and funny love story. Or perhaps it is a horror story. Or something else entirely. Regardless, I can’t recommend it enough. It plays on essentially all computers and there is a version coming to games consoles in the autumn.

e0d299b81c,CNN,Jennifer Aniston criticizes JD Vance for ‘childless cat ladies’ remarks: ‘I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children’ - CNN,"Jennifer Aniston is criticizing JD Vance for comments he made in his past about women without children.

Aniston shared a screenshot of Vance’s appearance on her Instagram stories, and wrote, “I truly can’t believe this is coming from a potential VP of The United States.”

In a 2021 appearance on Tucker Carlson’s former Fox News show, Vance, who was then a candidate for the Ohio Senate, told Carlson that the United States was being run by “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.”

In the resurfaced clip, which re-gained traction this week on social media, Vance said, “It’s just a basic fact — you look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC — the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it?”

Aniston — who typically keeps her personal life private, but has publicly spoken about her fertility journey — also wrote about Vance’s far-right stance on reproductive rights.

“All I can say is… Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day,” Aniston wrote in her post. “I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.”

Reproductive health will be a key issue in November’s election. Many women in Hollywood have spoken out about reproductive rights and will align with Harris, who has been the Biden administration’s leading voice on abortion and female health care.

Lindsay Lewis, Vance’s sister, said in a statement that her brother was not only “raised by some of the strongest women” she knows but also married “an incredibly strong woman in Usha.”

“JD is a testament to the women in his life, and the attacks from the media and Democrats that assume anything otherwise is vile,” Lewis said.

Aniston’s remarks about Vance’s comments come from a personal place. Throughout her career, she has been subjected to excessive tabloid coverage, which has repeatedly prodded into her relationships over the years and questioned why she does not have children.

In 2022, Aniston gave rare comments in an Allure cover story, sharing for the first time that she struggled with her fertility and underwent IVF.

“I was trying to get pregnant. It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road,” Aniston said, reflecting on her 30s and 40s. “All the years and years and years of speculation… It was really hard. I was going through IVF, drinking Chinese teas, you name it. I was throwing everything at it. I would’ve given anything if someone had said to me, ‘Freeze your eggs. Do yourself a favor.’ You just don’t think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed.”

In her Allure interview, Aniston said the media’s narrative that she “was just selfish” and “just cared about my career” was painful.

“God forbid a woman is successful and doesn’t have a child,” she said in 2022. “And the reason my husband left me, why we broke up and ended our marriage, was because I wouldn’t give him a kid. It was absolute lies.”

On Wednesday, Aniston also appeared to give her endorsement to Harris by reposting a 2018 video of Harris pushing then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on abortion rights. (The video Aniston reposted was shared by actress Allison Janney.)

CNN has reached out to Aniston’s representative for further comment on her post about Vance and her apparent endorsement of Harris.

b074c5dca0,ABC News,"What Haley donors, voters think about her saying she'll vote for Trump in November - ABC News","Former Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley's supporters are still split after she said she will be voting for former President Donald Trump, some seeing it as a ""greenlight"" for them to vote for Trump as well, while others are still not convinced.

After Haley suspended her campaign in March, Trump immediately became the presumptive GOP nominee but was faced with the task of bringing back Haley's supporters and reuniting the Republican Party without her endorsement, especially after months of bitter rivalry.

Haley's announcement on Wednesday that she will be voting for Trump appeared to soften the lingering animosity between the two, with Trump himself saying during media interviews on Thursday that he appreciated Haley's comment – even saying he thinks she's ""going to be on our team,"" while not specifying what he meant by ""our team.""

The latest comments from the two is a move that could unite their support base, especially for Haley's donors after earlier this year Trump ""permanently barred"" them from his MAGA movement, saying, ""We don't want them, and will not accept them,"" as the rivalry between the two escalated in the primaries.

""Anybody that makes a 'Contribution' to Birdbrain, from this moment forth, will be permanently barred from the MAGA camp,"" Trump wrote on his social media platform in January. ""We don't want them, and will not accept them ...""

Eric Levine, a New York-based Haley fundraiser who had vowed not to vote for Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol but had recently announced he would be voting for Trump, said: ""What was her alternative?""

He told ABC News voting for Biden instead of Trump is not an option right now when the United States needs to ""support Israel, confront our enemies and support our allies."" Levine also said that Haley's public comment -- even if it's not a full endorsement -- could persuade a lot of her supporters who felt ""lost"" inch toward Trump.

""I think this gives a lot of people permission to not just not vote for Joe Biden, but to vote for Donald Trump,"" Levine said. ""I think this is a very important statement that she made.""

Longtime Haley ally David Wilkins, a former U.S. ambassador to Canada under the Bush administration, also praised Haley's announcement as ""a good move,"" saying, ""Republicans need to be united as best we can.""

Ozzie Palomo, a lobbyist and prominent GOP bundler who raised money for Haley, echoed that sentiment, saying, ""I think it's the right call.""

""All the statements she made about Trump was during the primary; primaries are over and I think the world has dramatically changed, probably faster and more significantly than anyone anticipated over the last five, six months,"" Palomo said, criticizing the Biden administration.

""Her saying she plans to vote for him probably gives cover to a significant portion of those that remain on the fence to feel comfortable enough to do the same,"" Palomo said while acknowledging there are still likely people who will not support Trump.

Palomo said her comment that she will vote for Trump is ""about as close to a full-out endorsement as you're gonna get from her at least in the near term.""

""She could have easily said I'm not voting for Biden and left that open ended,"" Palomo said. ""However, she took the opportunity in a very public format to stress the fact that based on geopolitical matters and other policies like immigration, the economic mess, she's comfortable to pick one over the other in a clear binary choice.""

Palomo stressed it's still ""incumbent on the former presidential reach out to her supporters and try to lure them back,"" but noted the Trump campaign and the Republican Party's recent fundraising success is a sign that many are already moving toward Trump's direction — adding he himself has begun supporting Team Trump's high-dollar joint fundraising operation with the Republican National Committee.

However, another major Haley donor, who spoke under the condition of anonymity to talk freely, told ABC News that Haley's decision to vote for Trump did not change her mind about writing in her name in November instead of voting for the former president.

""I'm not voting for him -- I'll just tell you that,"" the donor said. ""I know it's a binary choice, and I bravo and brava to those who take the binary choice seriously. I'll be writing in Nikki Haley.""

The donor said the only way she's voting for Trump is if Haley is picked as his running mate, but the donor said she doesn't see that happening.

Earlier this month, Trump quickly shut down rumors about his team considering Haley as his running mate, writing on his social media platform, ""Nikki Haley is not under consideration for the V.P. slot, but I wish her well!""

""I'm surprised how many of the bigger donors are coming to the same conclusion that Nikki has,"" the donor said, later adding, ""Clearly, I'm a minority in the GOP.""

Criticizing Biden's policies, the donor said she feels Biden's team's effort to court Haley's support base has not been enough, adding at the end of the day, Haley is ""more at odds with Joe Biden than she is with Donald Trump.""

Following Haley's withdrawal from the presidential race, the Biden campaign said there is room in their coalition for Haley supporters and has continued to reach out to the Haley Coalition.

Most recently, Biden's reelection campaign held a call with a group of supporters of former presidential candidate Nikki Haley on Wednesday night—after Haley said she would vote for former President Donald Trump in November. On the call, voters shared policy issues that were important to them heading into November, with much of the focus on the border and immigration.

""Does this help her? Does it hurt her? Maybe both,"" the donor said of how Haley's comment that she plans to vote for Trump could affect her future political aspirations.

""Some people that thought she was going to be the avatar of beating up Trump until he's in the grave are probably not coming back for more spoonfuls, so I think that is a potential loss,"" the donor said. ""But there are a lot of Republicans that are 'real Republican' … That is support whoever the nominee is — then you're not a team player.""

Those who voted for Haley in the GOP primary also reacted to her saying she'll vote for the former president, many of whom said that they didn't see her intent to vote for him as a complete endorsement.

Eli Raykinstein, a student at Michigan State University, told ABC News he thought it was inevitable that Haley would say she would be voting for Trump, but he also added that he doesn't see it as a complete endorsement of the former president.

""I've already begun leaning more towards Trump, and I agree with Nikki when she says that Biden has been a complete catastrophe,"" Raykinstein said. ""I'm also looking to see who Trump chooses as his running-mate for 2024 cause I'm sure that will skew my thinking on the race, too.""

Alissa Baker, a voter in Virginia who supported Haley, told ABC News that she felt relief when Haley said she would vote for Trump because now we can move on from anticipating who she would vote for in November.

Baker also shared Raykinstein's thoughts -- that Haley is not endorsing Trump and added that this won't impact her decision on who she'll vote for in November.

""This was a personal decision of a private citizen, not an endorsement. Nikki has told her voters to vote their conscience and in November, that's exactly what I will do,"" Baker said.","A woman stands in front of two American flags, speaking into a microphone.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA24D9D20>,2024-05-24 19:33:00+00:00,https://abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/haley-donors-voters-shell-vote-trump-november/story?id=110533607,['Politics' 'National'],[0.9 0.8],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/b074c5dca0.png

And he couldn’t have been happier.

“I feel like I run better under heavy pressure,” Briscoe said. “I love the Game 7, pressure-heavy moment.”

He made a dramatic, three-wide, late-race pass and held on to win the Southern 500 and qualify for the playoffs, giving Stewart-Haas Racing a final chance to add to its championship legacy before it shuts down after the season.

Briscoe and his team head to the postseason reveling in that pressure in the final days of the program that won NASCAR titles with Tony Stewart in 2011 and Kevin Harvick in 2014.

Story continues below advertisement

Briscoe got a call from Stewart, his owner, and drivers came up to congratulate him on the win.

Briscoe took the lead with the three-wide pass over Kyle Larson and Ross Chastain for the lead, then outran two-time series champion Kyle Busch at the end.

Briscoe pulled away on a final restart with 17 laps and held off Busch, who like Briscoe needed a victory to reach the postseason.

“We just won the Southern 500!” an emotional Briscoe said on the car radio.

Briscoe is prepared for more milestones with Stewart-Haas.

“Yeah, this group, the day we found out that the team wasn’t going to exist anymore, we went over to the shop board, looked at each other and said, ‘We’re in this to the end,’” Briscoe said. “I was saying all week, `We’ve got one bullet left in the chamber.’ That bullet hit.”

Joe Gibbs Racing drivers Ty Gibbs and Martin Truex Jr. got the final two postseason spots on points, while Bubba Wallace and Chastain, both within 27 points of the cutoff line when the race began, came up short.

Briscoe’s dramatic move spoiled another dominant Darlington run by Kyle Larson, who led 263 laps but was not the same after getting passed by the winner. Larson was trying to overtake Tyler Reddick for the regular-season points title — and the 15 bonus points the leader receives — but came up a point short.

Christopher Bell was third, followed by Larson, Chastain, Denny Hamlin, Joey Logano, Corey LaJoie and Reddick.

Truex, racing his last season before retirement, just needed a solid, problem-free run at the track “Too Tough To Tame” to advance. Instead, he left his fate in others’ hands when he crashed out on Lap 3 as his car slid up and hit defending NASCAR champion Ryan Blaney.

Story continues below advertisement

But following Larson’s victory in the second stage — he also won the first stage — NASCAR announced that Truex had wrapped up a spot in the 16-driver playoff field.

Bubba Wallace entered the weekend as the first-man out of the playoffs and got a boost when he won his first Darlington pole Saturday. But with 23XI co-owner Michael Jordan in his pit box to watch, Wallace got caught up in a six-car wreck 24 laps from the finish.

Jordan, wearing a headset and watching intently, threw his hands up and bowed his head when he saw Wallace involved in the wreck.

“Wasn’t good enough for 16th this year, hate that,” Wallace said. “Stinks saying that, but wasn’t for a lack of effort.”

Busch came up short a second straight week, losing to a fellow winless driver this season. He was beaten by Harrison Burton last week at Daytona.

“Hate it for our guys,” said Busch, who won titles in 2015 and 2019. “Something to build on and get better for. We just missed a lot early in the year, the middle part of the year to be in this spot, on the outside looking in.”

Reddick's race

Tyler Reddick worked through a stomach illness as he held off Larson to win the regular season. He said his son was ill last week at Daytona and, as most parents know, that left Reddick susceptible to getting sick.

Reddick felt it coming on midday Friday and thought it had cleared up earlier Sunday. Then it came on in full force once the race began. Reddick thanked his crew, who kept him medicated and hydrated to make it through.

“At one point, I was just waiting to puke all over myself,” he said. “Thankfully, they kept that from happening.”

Playoff field

Reddick won the regular-season title, with Larson in second. The rest of the playoff field is: Chase Elliott, followed by Christopher Bell, William Byron, Blaney, Denny Hamlin, Brad Keselowski, Joey Logano, Austin Cindric, Daniel Suarez, Alex Bowman, Briscoe, Gibbs and Truex.

The first round starts in Atlanta, then goes to Watkins Glen and Bristol before the field is cut to 12.

Honoring Cale

Cale Yarborough , the Hall of Famer driver who died at age 84 on New Year’s Eve, was remembered at his hometown track as Dale Jarrett drove the 1977 Oldsmobile Cutlass that Yarborough used to win his third straight Cup Series title in 1978 during pace laps. Yarborough won five of the Labor Day weekend crown jewel races , second to Jeff Gordon’s six, at Darlington after growing up there a few miles away.

Up next

The playoffs start next week at Atlanta on Sunday, with the first round continuing at Watkins Glen and Bristol the following two weeks.

Monday's theme was the economy, so several of the statements checked relate to U.S. economic concerns. Former President Donald Trump made a surprise appearance at the convention Monday night.

But the claim is not true if viewed through the prism of many of these common metrics used to judge economic performance:

GDP growth has been higher under Mr. Biden and was also higher at times in the 1990s, 1960s, and 1950 ( World Bank).

Stock market: Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Dwight Eisenhower also had higher percentage gains in the S&P 500 during their first terms than Trump did (S&P).

Homeownership increased by 2.1 points under Trump, rising to 65.8%. However, the highest level of homeownership was in 2004, when it hit 69.1%. (U.S. Census Bureau quarterly seasonally adjusted rates (table 14a))

The national deficit was the largest it had been in over two decades under the Trump administration, according to data from the U.S. Treasury. The deficit peaked in fiscal year 2020 at $3.13 trillion, and declined to $1.7 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2023.

Federal debt increased by 50% during Trump's term, in part due to spending on COVID aid packages, according to data from the Treasury Department. By comparison, federal debt increased by 8% under President Bill Clinton and by 25% under President Joe Biden so far.

However, during Trump's presidency, wages went up and inflation remained low. Real wage growth under Trump was the best in recent history. (federal data analyzed by Texas A&M University)

But Trump did preside over very low unemployment, February 2020's rate of 3.5% was the lowest since 1969, but not the lowest ever. (Bureau of Labor Statistics).

Fact check on Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin's claim that women and minorities saw record low unemployment under Trump: Partially true, needs context

Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin: ""Women, Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans all saw record low unemployment under President Donald J. Trump.""

Details: Across all of these demographics, the unemployment rate has been comparable during both President Biden and former President Trump's administrations.

Unemployment for women was at a record low in the 1950s. There have been more periods of lower unemployment for women under Mr. Biden than under Trump, and this is true for Black Americans, too. For Hispanic and Latino Americans, unemployment reached a low of 3.9% during both administrations. Asian Americans saw their lowest unemployment rate under Trump, 2% in May 2018.

Here are the unemployment levels for each of these groups, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics

Fact check on Youngkin's claim that Trump's presidency had high growth and low inflation, and Biden's presidency has low growth and high inflation: Misleading, needs context

Youngkin: ""Under President Trump, America had high growth and low inflation. Under Joe Biden, America has low growth and high inflation.""

Details: It's true that inflation remained low during Trump's presidency, with year-over-year inflation peaking at 2.9% in July 2018. Inflation has been much higher under Mr. Biden, with year-over-year inflation peaking at 9.1% in June 2022. But year-over-year inflation under Mr. Biden has since cooled to about 3%.

But there has also been stronger economic growth during Mr. Biden's presidency: Annual GDP growth is averaging 3.4%, according to figures from the World Bank. If the 2020 pandemic is excluded, growth after inflation under Trump's average of 2.6% was lower.

By Laura Doan

Fact check on Sen. Marsha Blackburn's claim that Biden would let Trump's 2017 tax cuts expire, leading to biggest tax increase in U.S. history: Misleading

GOP Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee: ""If Joe and Kamala are reelected they say they'll let [Trump's 2017 tax cuts] expire. That will be the biggest tax increase in American history.""

Details: The Biden administration has proposed extending Trump-era tax cuts for families earning under $400,000 annually, instead of letting them expire in 2025. White House budget plans show Mr. Biden wants to raise taxes on corporations and high-income earners.

By Laura Doan

Fact check on Youngkin's claim that 2.4 million Americans were lifted out of poverty under Trump: True

Youngkin: ""Under President Trump 2.4 million Americans were lifted out of poverty.""

Details: Youngkin's number may have been a little low. According to a Bureau of Labor Statistics analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data, there were 40.6 million living in poverty in 2016 and 37.9 million in 2021. That's a difference of 2.7 million people living in poverty by the end of Trump's term, rather than 2.4 million.

By Joseph Enoch

Blackburn's claim that Biden hired 85,000 IRS agents to harass working Americans: False

Blackburn: ""Joe and Kamala couldn't help themselves. They hired 85,000 new IRS agents to harass hard-working Americans.""

Details: The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 provided a 10-year, $80 billion investment in the IRS. A 2021 Treasury report showed that the IRS could add nearly 87,000 full-time employees over the following 10 years. The figure doesn't specify how many of those hires would be employed as auditors, versus other roles. It's a potential number, not a net number. Over a decade, the agency will see people retire or leave. President Biden has touted the increased funding as a way to help the IRS go after tax cheats, not ""hard-working Americans.""

bbfba38f9e,Financial Times,Uncovering Hong Kong’s vibrant street-art scene - Financial Times,"This article is part of a guide to Hong Kong from FT Globetrotter

When Berlin native Alexandra Unrein moved to Hong Kong several years ago, she quickly fell for the city’s dynamic street art. So much so that she began running dedicated tours. Her Wanderlust Walks snake through the alleys to reveal giant, abstract graphics, plastered across entire façades, as well as the subtle glyphs and symbols that blend into the clutter of the city.

“In comparison to the western world, street art all around Asia is still incredibly underrated and often goes unnoticed,” says the former flight attendant. “Hong Kong is, unfortunately, no exception.”

Unrein aims to remedy this. When I visited in March, I took a tour that begins in the Sheung Wan area on Lower Lascar Row. In a quiet courtyard under a bloom of bougainvillea — and the shadows of dozens of floors of high-rise housing — we encounter two striking figures embracing in a flurry of heart-shaped, green and red leaves. “Stories in the Wind” (2023) is the work of Italian artist Marco Zedone, better known as Zed1. Inspired by both the surrounding foliage and the colours of the city as a whole, his Pop-Surrealist image broaches the question of chance meetings and relationships, the winds of fate buffeting the characters about like the leaves — real and painted — around them.

Central boasts the city’s richest mix of outdoor artwork (although Kowloon and the New Territories also have their fair share). On nearby Water Lane, one of Algerian-born Ceet Fouad’s Pop Art chickens offers a playful critique of the modern world’s homogeneity. A few metres away (and also around the corner on the façade of 36 Sai Street), we find works by Portuguese artist Alexandre Farto, aka Vhils, whose faces etched into the render of the building are part of his Scratching the Surface project. Taking on the role of an “urban archaeologist”, Farto sifts through the colours and textures of a building’s surfaces to lend an organic depth to his compositions.

Farto’s artworks were part of the 2016 edition of HKwalls, the annual festival of street art that has unfolded across the city since 2014. If you visit in March, the proliferation of paint pots and bamboo scaffolding on the pavements heralds the event’s arrival. While city and its galleries teem with tens of thousands of visitors to the Art Basel fair, artists from around the world leave their mark on the urban canvas.

This year, 32 artists — from Hong Kong and mainland China as well as further afield — added new layers to the city’s public spaces. “When we [first] knocked on doors to ask for walls, not a lot of people knew what street art was,” says Maria Wong, the festival’s managing director. Ten years later, owners of homes, shops and offices are eagerly signing up for their walls to be stencilled and sprayed.

“People are generally very happy to see new works popping up around the city,” says Wong. “[They] brighten up the neighbourhood, and add colour and life.”

Unrein leads us to Square Street, where, for HKwalls 2023, Los Angeles-based Lauren YS (Squid Licker) combined the concept of taijitu — the yin-yang symbol — with Taoist temple aesthetics, traditional operatic costumes and vibrant portraits in “Mind Temple”. Against a pink-blue sunset, a tiger-dragon hybrid hurtles along the wall, representing darkness and light.

With its constant contrast between wide avenues and tight alleys, Hong Kong’s theatrical scale lends itself to painting. “To me, the city feels almost stereotypically urban,” says Unrein. “Street art feels like the cool tattoos on her skin, making her even more beautiful and unique.”

This is certainly the case at the junction of Peel Street and Hollywood Road, home to Uma Nota — the city’s first Brazilian-Japanese street food joint. We’re not here for the frango assado, though; as of last year, the restaurant has another draw, in the form of a mural by Hong Kong-based French artist Elsa Jeandedieu. The scene of smiling black-and-white faces, alongside multicoloured burst of birds and flowers from Brazil and Japan, is a vibrant tribute to the coming together of different cultures — and cuisines.

Many of the artists that contribute to the city’s street art scene are international but there is no shortage of local talent to track down, either. Unrein cites Kristopher Ho, Uncle, Zoie Lam and Bao Ho as just a few of the names to look out for. In turn, Bao shouts out Devil and Boms.

That said, if you can’t find a specific work, it’s not necessarily your map reading that’s at fault; more likely it has simply been painted over or updated. Wong estimates that most murals hang around for five years at most, with a couple dating back as far as 2016. “Street art is a transient thing,” she says. The ephemerality is part of the fun.

Should You Enroll in a GIS Certificate Online Program?

Pro Tip

If you’re trying to get hired ASAP, some GIS certificate programs may help you find an internship. Successful internships could lead to a job offer or important professional connection.

If you want to learn on your terms, online college may offer the flexibility you need. But before committing to an online certificate program, make sure you have the tools to succeed in a distance learning environment.

Start by evaluating your personal learning style. Because you won’t have the structure of a traditional classroom or the accountability of in-person classmates, you’ll need stellar self-discipline and organizational skills to stay on top of your online coursework. If that’s not you, you might prioritize in-person and hybrid programs instead.

However, if you enjoy independent learning and you know how to motivate yourself, online college might be the right choice for you.

Accreditation for Online GIS Certificate Programs

One critical factor in choosing a GIS certificate program is accreditation. There are two important forms of college accreditation: institutional and programmatic.

Institutional accreditation concerns an entire college or university. It demonstrates that the school isn’t a diploma mill; instead, it maintains solid business practices, financial management, student outcomes and faculty members. This distinction is also important because you can only receive federal financial aid if you attend an accredited institution.

The U.S. Department of Education and the Council of Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) oversee accrediting organizations. If in doubt, you can search CHEA’s directory to learn whether a school is institutionally accredited.

Programmatic accreditation is a more precise form of quality assurance that refers to academic programs or departments. This isn’t as common in GIS as in other fields. However, the U.S. Geospatial Intelligence Foundation specifically accredits GEOINT certificate programs.

Additionally, some programs design their curriculum to meet professional certification requirements. For example, the GIS Certification Institute maintains the GIS Professional (GISP®) standard. Credits from an accredited institution can count toward earning that distinction.

How To Find the Right Online GIS Certificate Program for You

Pro Tip

Some schools don’t offer financial aid to students in certificate programs. Evaluate your budget and financing options before committing to a program.

While you can work in GIS without a certificate, having one can give you an edge in the job market and add to your earning potential. Still, it’s important to choose the right program. Take the following factors into consideration.

Consider Your Future Goals

First, establish why you might pursue a GIS certificate instead of a full degree. What are your academic goals? Do you see yourself eventually earning a four-year degree? Some GIS jobs require a bachelor’s. If you want to leave the possibility open, make sure you attend an accredited college that offers transferable credits.

Next, consider your career goals. This is especially important with GIS because, as this list shows, you can pursue specialized GIS certificates. If you plan to earn professional certification, look for a program that counts toward its requirements and prepares you to pass the exam.

Know Your Budget and Financing Options

In general, an academic certificate is far less expensive than a full bachelor’s degree. On the other hand, certificates offer a much narrower scope than a full four-year degree. As such, they won’t open as many doors post-graduation. Still, a short, focused program can help you start earning money as a GIS professional, with the option of pursuing an advanced degree later on.

Per-credit tuition for programs on this list ranges from $105 to $505. Certificates required 12 to 25 credits. In total, these certificates cost $1,890 to $8,080.

If that seems like a lot, compare it to the average cost of one year at a public university: $9,750, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. The average cost of tuition at a private nonprofit institution, meanwhile, is $38,400.

Another factor to consider is financing. Your options include student loans, scholarships, payment plans, veterans benefits and grants. Start by filling out your Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA®. And remember, some schools don’t offer financial aid to “non-degree seeking students,” a term that includes students pursuing certificates.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Online GIS Certificate Programs

Can I learn GIS online?

Yes. You can pick up a GIS credential without setting foot in a classroom. Many programs feature practicum hours for students to get hands-on experience working with GIS technologies.

What does a GIS certificate do?

GIS stands for geographic information system and a GIS certificate is an education credential that teaches students to analyze spatial data and use of geographic mapping software, among other skills. A GIS certificate entitles you to work in entry-level positions in the GIS field.

Do you need a GIS degree to work in GIS?

No, you can work some entry-level positions with only a GIS certificate. However, completing a related associate or bachelor’s degree will lead to more job opportunities.","An aerial view of a coastal area with varying shades of blue and green, indicating different depths or types of water bodies.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BE1DCF4F0>,2024-06-06 15:15:58+00:00,https://www.forbes.com,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/education/certifications/best-gis-certificates-online/,['Business and Finance' 'Other'],[0.95 0.7 ],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/ba4455ddc2.png

Taylor Wilson:

Good morning. I'm Taylor Wilson and today is Saturday, August 10th, 2024. This is The Excerpt. Today, an Illinois sheriff will retire amid criticism over the killing of Sonya Massey, plus the latest from Brazil after a devastating plane crash, and it's the final weekend of the Olympics in Paris.

♦

Sangamon County Sheriff, Jack Campbell says he will retire amid criticism over the killing of Sonya Massey in Illinois. The head of the agency since 2018 said in a statement that he will retire no later than the end of this month. The July 6th killing of Massey in her own home has sparked national outcry over police brutality and led to demonstrations and a federal probe by the Justice Department. Former Deputy, Sean P. Grayson has been charged with three counts of first degree murder in connection with Massey's death. Grayson claims he fired his gun after fearing Massey would throw boiling liquid at him, according to a sheriff's office report released to the public. Noted civil rights attorney, Ben Crump, who represents the Massey family, said in a statement yesterday evening that Campbell's impending retirement marks a turning point in the Massey case. For more, tune into Monday's show when I speak with USA Today National Correspondent, Trevor Hughes, about his reporting on the ground in Springfield, talking with members of Sonya Massey's family pressing for accountability.

A regional plane carrying 61 people crashed yesterday in a residential neighborhood in Brazil, killing everyone on board, according to the airline. In a social media post, Voepass, a regional airline based in Sao Paulo State, confirmed the crash of its flight and said 57 passengers and four crew members were on board, all carrying Brazil-issued documents. Brazil's UOL news channel reported at least three passengers were refused entry to the plane before it took off. Marcelo Moreno, who leads Brazil's Aviation Incident Investigation Center, cautioned in a news briefing that it was still too early to determine the cause of the crash, but said that it appeared the aircraft did not reach out to traffic control reporting an emergency.

Do you need 1,000 bucks to cover an unexpected expense? Starting this year, you may be able to withdraw the money from your 401(k) with relative ease. I spoke with USA Today Personal Finance Reporter, Daniel De Vise to learn more. Daniel, always great having you on. Thanks for making the time.

Daniel De Vise:

It's a pleasure.

Taylor Wilson:

So Daniel, what do these new rules allow when it comes to withdrawing from a 401(k) for an emergency?

Daniel De Vise:

Yeah, as I understand it, starting this year, you can take basically a quick $1,000 out of your 401(k) for an emergency that you define yourself. If you think you have an emergency, you can say so and you can get the money, and the Wall Street Journal in a headline said it was like turning your retirement account into an emergency ATM.

Taylor Wilson:

And how do taxes apply on this?

Daniel De Vise:

I'm actually asking the IRS because this is complicated. If you use this new emergency withdrawal provision, you can take up to 1,000 bucks and you can do it once a year, and I think that you end up having to pay regular income tax, but I'm reading it from some sources that you may be able to avoid the income tax if you pay the money back. It's not clear to me exactly how you'd pay it back, but that's something I'm actually asking the IRS folks to answer.

The important thing is that you avoid the penalty, which I think is a 10% penalty that you would normally pay if you take money early out of a 401(k). So in other words, if you or I just went and raided our 401(k) account right now, without explanation, you'd pay income tax and you'd pay a whopping 10% penalty on the money.

Taylor Wilson:

Yeah, so then is that the big difference from other withdrawal possibilities from retirement accounts?

Daniel De Vise:

That's right, and that's what makes this maybe a more attractive thing for maybe a lower income family that's more struggling to open a 401(k). It's kind of a drawback to the 401(k). You can't easily get the money out if you need it, right? But with this emergency withdrawal provision, let's say you have a car repair that comes up or a really big air conditioning bill and you just don't have the funds in your salary, you can take a few 100 bucks or even 1,000 bucks out with very minimal consequences to your taxes. It makes the money feel more available to you. Not quite like an emergency savings account, but close, right?

Taylor Wilson:

Yeah. So as you say, minimal tax consequences, Daniel. So should folks take advantage of these rules? What do experts say here?

Daniel De Vise:

Well, this is a very difficult question because it's retirement money. You're not supposed to raid your retirement savings until you retire. My source from Vanguard was telling me, ""You're better off, of course, if you have a savings account, an emergency savings account."" You put $1,000 in there, $5,000, $10,000. I've heard estimates as high as $20,000 or 30,000. That's hard to do, but if you can do it, use that money to pay for the car repair, use that money to pay for the emergency dental extraction. Don't take money out of your retirement.

The reason is if you take money out of your 401(k), even if you eventually put it back, you're missing out on a lot of the interest that that money would've earned. And if you keep doing it, if you keep going back to the well year after year and taking out $1,000 here and $1,000 there, you'll ultimately sap your retirement savings, and then you won't have the money when you retire.

Taylor Wilson:

Yep, great point. Great insight as always. Daniel De Vise covers personal finance for USA Today. Thank you, sir.

Daniel De Vise:

Thank you.

Americans are overwhelmingly in favor of reforming the Supreme Court along lines proposed by President Joe Biden, even as approval for the high court is marked by a political divide, that's according to a new USA Today Ipsos poll. 76% of Americans support a binding code of conduct for the Supreme Court, according to the poll. The result comes after more than a year of revelations that Justice Clarence Thomas failed to disclose receiving millions of dollars worth of free luxury trips and other gifts. On the question of whether the Justices make decisions based on the law or their partisan political views, 65% of Democrats said politics drove the court, while 51% of independents and just 26% of Republicans agreed. Meanwhile, some 66% of Republicans had a very favorable or somewhat favorable view of the court, while 71% of Democrats had a very unfavorable or somewhat unfavorable opinion. The court has a conservative majority. You can read more of the poll's findings with a link in today's show notes.

As the Olympics wrap up this weekend, the men's and women's marathons will be held today and tomorrow respectively, but in-between, there's an Olympic first, as some 20,000 amateur athletes get set to run in a marathon of their own tonight. I spoke with USA Today World Affairs Correspondent, Kim Hjelmgaard, for more from Paris. Kim, thanks for making the time.

Kim Hjelmgaard:

Thanks for having me.

Taylor Wilson:

So Kim, tell us about this Olympic first, amateur athletes in a marathon? What is this?

Kim Hjelmgaard:

Yeah, it's right. It's an initiative that the Paris organizers have decided to do this year. It's never happened before, and basically, about 400,000 or 500,000 people around the world applied to take part in one of two events. One is a marathon and another is a 10K race, but it's not as straightforward as that. The courses are the exact same courses that the Olympic athletes are using, so they do it within the same security perimeter. They do it, they get medals. There's lots of fanfare associated with it. So it's like an opportunity basically for, ""Ordinary people,"" to follow in the footsteps of Olympians, to try to have some sort of experience of what it's like to compete in the Games even though they're not actually competing.

Taylor Wilson:

Right. So what was the qualifying process or the criteria like for these folks to get involved?

Kim Hjelmgaard:

Most marathons, competitive ones, you've got to qualify with a certain time. In this case, there's no qualifying time because they wanted to try to keep it, what the organizers say is, as inclusive as possible. Instead, they set people these different challenges. You had to download an app, you had to get a Garmin style sports watch. They'd throw out these challenges each week that you could do or not. A typical challenge, for example, would be they'd ask you to run for a couple of hours to check your stamina and fitness and all the rest of that. Once you've done a certain amount of these challenges over the course of... I believe it was like six months or a year, you accumulated points and you needed to get 100,000 points. And once you got 100,000 points, they basically entered you into a lottery because it was far more people that wanted to do it than they could actually accommodate. There's 20,000 people running in the marathon, 20,000 people running in the 10K.

One of the things that they tried to engineer, similar to what they've tried to do on the field of play more generally, is complete gender parity. So same amount of men and women running in both of these races.

Taylor Wilson:

Yeah. So Kim, I want to hear about some of the participants here. You spoke with an American woman named Sue. What's her story and how did she get involved?

Kim Hjelmgaard:

Yeah, she was super cool. Sue was basically one day in her house outside Washington DC. She was watching the Tour de France with her daughter and it flashed up that the Olympics were going to be in Paris the next year. And not only that, but it flashed up that people could participate in this public marathon and she's an avid marathoner. She's run 28 of them. She's also, like a lot of people, super into the Olympics. And so it was a dream come true for her to be able to apply for this thing and go through the challenges. And she lucked out. She got chosen, but basically, she has a bit of a money backstory because the anecdote she told me is that she'd always tell her husband that she had to go running because she was trying for the Olympics. And of course, that is true in one sense because yes, she's coming to Paris, but she's not quite doing it in the same way that Olympians did it.

Taylor Wilson:

I also have to hear a little bit about this, Kim. You wrote about China's so-called fastest delivery man who is participating. What can you tell us about him?

Kim Hjelmgaard:

He seems like he's quite a character. He's a delivery guy, has been doing it for almost a decade. He's also a runner, and one of the things that he would do to train while he was working is he would attach some sandbag weights to his legs. It would make it even harder while he was doing his job, and he's over here now in Paris. By all accounts, he's like a super-fast runner, so I think he's got a good chance.

Taylor Wilson:

I'm also just curious about the logistics here. The marathon route is a bit atypical, and also, just running at night, Kim, what are some of these things present in terms of challenges for the participants?

Kim Hjelmgaard:

I should put all my cards on the table. I've never run a marathon. I can't really relate to the stamina and the skillset involved. However, what I've been told by people who are doing it and have done it is that it's quite unusual to do it at night. It changes the rhythm of it. It changes what your body's expecting to consume at night. They're starting it at... Depends on the 10K or the marathon, but they're starting it between 9:00 and 11:00 PM, and then they have to finish by 4:30 AM because they're doing it ahead of the women's marathon, which is on the last day.

The marathon course is going to snake through... There'll be a backdrop of all the landmarks and monuments that you might expect as a visitor to Paris, whether that's the Eiffel Tower or the Louvre Museum, and it's going to finish in Versailles, which has its own historical resonances for various different reasons to do with signing peace treaties there. It was also the seat of French political power in the 17th 18th centuries. And there's also a component of this marathon and our general theme of the Olympics. The International Olympic Committee has tried to roll out in various different ways, as I was saying before, gender parity. And Versailles also has some connective tissue to that concept because around the time the French Revolution, the start of the French Revolution, there was a 6,000-strong march that included a lot of women who were protesting about rising prices.

Taylor Wilson:

Kim Hjelmgaard joining us from out on the street in Paris. Thank you, Kim.

Kim Hjelmgaard:

Thanks for having me.

d322255c7f,The New York Times,Trump and Biden Surrogates Go Toe-to-Toe on Sunday Shows - The New York Times,"After two news-filled weeks in American politics — with former President Donald J. Trump convicted of 34 felonies, and President Biden issuing the most restrictive border policy of any modern Democrat — surrogates for the two campaigns flooded the morning news shows on Sunday to promote their candidates.

Republicans defended Mr. Trump against what they insisted was an unfair trial in New York. And discussion of Mr. Biden’s executive order resembled a fun-house mirror, with Republicans criticizing a policy they had backed under Mr. Trump and Democrats backing one they had condemned.

Noem recommended a woman as Trump’s running mate — and again defended killing her dog.

Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, who was campaigning for Mr. Trump in Wisconsin, said it “would be beneficial” for him to choose a woman as his running mate. His campaign’s shortlist, according to people briefed on the process, consists of seven men and only one woman, Representative Elise Stefanik of New York.

“All the polls tell him in these swing states that a woman on the ticket helps him win,” Ms. Noem said on CNN. She added, “I have spent the majority of my time here in Wisconsin talking to women and talking to those people that are independent and on the fringe, and they’re leaning towards Donald Trump, but they also want to know that their perspective is going to be at the table when decisions are made.”

Ms. Noem was once seen as a potential running mate herself, but her stock fell when she published a book in which she described shooting her 14-month-old dog, Cricket, after it disrupted a hunt and killed a neighbor’s chickens. She defended herself again on Sunday, saying she had “protected my children from a vicious animal.”

Abbott denounced Biden’s executive order …

Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican who has sought to set his own border policies, condemned the executive order Mr. Biden issued last week to close the border to asylum seekers when crossings surge — a measure similar to one Mr. Trump tried to enact in 2018.

“What Biden has done is not doing anything to actually secure the border,” Mr. Abbott said on Fox News, arguing that the restrictions were not being sufficiently enforced.

He then made a questionable claim that — because Mr. Biden’s executive order closes the border to asylum seekers only when illegal crossings reach a seven-day daily average of 2,500, which they have regularly done — Mr. Biden was “actually authorizing more people to cross the border illegally.”

… while Coons praised it.

Senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat and co-chairman of Mr. Biden’s re-election campaign, opposed asylum restrictions when Mr. Trump enacted them. But on Sunday, he defended Mr. Biden’s similar restrictions because, he said, their motivations were different.

“There’s a stark difference in the values that President Biden and former President Trump bring to trying to address the issue of border security and immigration,” Mr. Coons said on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” noting Mr. Trump’s ban on people entering the United States from several majority-Muslim countries and his separation of children from their parents, as well as his opposition to a bipartisan border-security deal that Mr. Biden supported.

“Former President Trump actually wants a problem to solve through his election rather than a solution that a bipartisan group of senators stood behind,” he said. “President Biden is moving ahead with forceful leadership at securing our border. President Trump is simply making a political issue of this.”

Whitmer said contraception was “very much at risk” under Republicans.

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, a Democrat, dismissed many Republicans’ assertions that they supported unfettered access to contraception.

“When the U.S. Senate puts forth policy to ensure that they have an opportunity to enshrine access to contraception, and Republicans vote against it and kill that bill, it is very much at risk here in this moment,” she said on CNN, referring to legislation that Republicans blocked last week. “I think that what we’re seeing out of the Republicans, saying that they want to protect this, is disingenuous at best and an outright lie at worst.”

In response to a question about the trial of Mr. Biden’s son Hunter, she praised the president for affirming that he would accept the verdict and would not pardon his son.

“There is a stark choice in front of us between a president who respects the rule of law and a former president who is a convicted felon, who wants to use the implements of government to go after his enemies,” she said.

Cotton said Biden wasn’t supporting Israel and Ukraine enough.

Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who is on the Trump campaign’s list of possible running mates, said on “Fox News Sunday” that Mr. Biden wasn’t sending enough aid to Ukraine, a claim that ignored the fact that his fellow Republicans for months blocked aid Mr. Biden had supported.

Mr. Cotton also accused the president of insufficiently backing Israel. Mr. Biden, while increasingly criticizing Israel’s actions in Gaza, has supplied billions of dollars worth of weapons to support them, alienating opponents of the war whom Mr. Cotton said the president was “catering to.”

Vance recast Trump as a champion of veterans.

Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, another possible running mate to Mr. Trump, criticized Mr. Biden for his trip to Normandy to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day, and for an ad from his campaign that featured veterans denouncing Mr. Trump.

“Joe Biden is trying to cover himself in the glory of the Greatest Generation, despite trying to destroy everything that they fought for,” Mr. Vance said on Fox News. “So he’s made up these ridiculous accusations that Donald Trump doesn’t respect veterans.”","Two men in suits with American flags in the background, one with a yellow tie and the other with a blue tie, both speaking into microphones.",<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x117 at 0x7D6B7E665960>,2024-06-09 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/us/politics/trump-biden-immigration-kristi-noem.html,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/d322255c7f.png
09afba4214,The Guardian,Home Office faces fallout from Rwanda roundup as asylum seekers hide or flee - The Guardian,"The Home Office is dealing with growing fallout from the high-profile roundups of asylum seekers it wants to send to Rwanda, as some have gone into hiding while others have fled across the border to Ireland.

Officials began rounding up asylum seekers to detain them for the Rwanda scheme a week ago, with at least one now on hunger strike and another threatening suicide.

While the government has disseminated its message widely about detaining people for Rwanda, it is not clear whether officials had anticipated that some asylum seekers would go into hiding and others would go to Ireland.

Lou Calvey, the director of the charity Asylum Matters, said: “Frontline asylum charities report people leaving their asylum accommodation in order to avoid arrest. They are raising the alarm about the increasing risks of destitution and exploitation.”

Asylum seekers who have attended regular reporting sessions at centres around the UK have said that they had never seen things so quiet.

“I walked right in and didn’t have to queue at all. In all the years I’ve been reporting I’ve never seen it so deserted,” said one man from Belarus who has been in the UK for more than a decade but is fearful the Home Office could arrest him even though he is not in scope for the first cohort of returns – those who arrived between January 2022 and June 2023.

Another asylum seeker who has received a notice of intent for Rwanda but has not so far been detained said he had received several calls from friends in his community urging him to go into hiding.

A Syrian refugee said he was urging asylum seeker friends at risk of being sent to Rwanda to hide.

“I was an asylum seeker in 2020 when the Home Office was trying to deport as many asylum seekers as possible to European countries they had passed through before Brexit started. Some asylum seekers went into hiding then and I can see that it is happening again because of Rwanda.”

The first week of roundups of asylum seekers for Rwanda has not acted as the deterrent the government hoped for small boat crossings, with 1,420 people crossing in the last seven days up to Sunday. The figure includes the highest daily total so far this year with 711 crossing last Wednesday.

Meanwhile, in Ireland, just days after the authorities removed a tent city of asylum seekers in the heart of Dublin outside the International Protection Accommodation Services centre, the tents have returned close to where they were before.

Both sides of the city’s Grand Canal are lined by about 70 blue tarpaulin tents provided by charities for asylum seekers from countries including Nigeria and Afghanistan.

Last week the new Irish prime minister, Simon Harris, told the Dáil that “We do not want to live in a country where makeshift shantytowns are allowed to just develop.”

The authorities in Dublin are expected to provide more accommodation later this week to deal with the unprecedented numbers seeking international protection, some arriving from the UK.

Ireland’s justice minister, Helen McEntee, recently said 80% of those arrivals had crossed the border from Northern Ireland. Later in the week Dublin estimated the figure to be about 90%.

The Northern Ireland justice minister, Naomi Long, later said: “Those are figures we in Northern Ireland don’t recognise.”

At a quiet Home Office reporting centre a few days ago, one Ethiopian asylum seeker who is in scope for removal to Rwanda because of his date of arrival in the UK said he was “very worried” about being detained when he went inside the centre to report.

He said: “My feelings are not good. Everything’s not good.”

An Iranian Kurdish man who came to the UK 14 years ago said he did not understand how refugees could be sent to a country they did not come from.

“Originally I’m not coming from Rwanda. How can you send me to Rwanda? I don’t want to go to Rwanda,” he said. “Tell me how, what’s the reason?”

A Home Office spokesperson said:“The unacceptable number of people who continue to cross the Channel demonstrates exactly why we must get flights to Rwanda off the ground as soon as possible.

“Many of those in scope to be relocated are also staying in Home Office accommodation. For those that aren’t, we have robust procedures in place to prevent absconding and we remain in contact with those in scope for relocation to Rwanda through a number of means, including face-to-face and digital reporting.”",A group of immigration enforcement officers in dark uniforms are seen approaching a white van with a partially open door.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BA1167700>,2024-05-07 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/may/07/asylum-seekers-hide-or-flee-to-ireland-to-avoid-uk-rwanda-detentions,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/09afba4214.png
5cdf7eb3fb,The Guardian,My crippling fear of conflict is causing me to withdraw from life - The Guardian,"I have been afflicted by shame and guilt, leading to anxiety and very low self-esteem, all my life. Whenever I find myself in conflict initiated by another person, I am so overcome by guilt and the feeling that I must be in the wrong, that I cannot think clearly. This prevents me being able to work out at the time, whether I have actually done something wrong that requires me to address the issue, or that the other person is being unreasonable. It is not until I have had time to process what has happened, that I can understand what has occurred. By then, the moment has gone.

If I do try to raise an issue of potential conflict with another person, I almost always do it in writing. I find that this way I can take time to express myself clearly. But where conflict arises on the spot, this is not an option.

Because I try to avoid conflict, the situation does not often arise. However, this is often due to the fact that I let issues that I should address go. I find my inability to manage conflict and my feelings of guilt and shame are causing me to withdraw from life and become reclusive.

So many people tell me they fear conflict but often it’s not so much the conflict on its own that’s feared, but confronting someone you think can’t handle it. In this respect we anticipate trouble. And this usually goes back to a pattern learned very young in life, of having to be hyper vigilant of someone else’s reaction. When you layer in guilt and shame, it becomes “very, very paralysing” says psychotherapist, director of the Oxford Process and a specialist in conflict resolution, Gabrielle Rifkind.

“We all,” says Rifkind “have these inner demons that are blaming and shaming us. What we need to do is make sense of where they came from.”

You may be experiencing this, points out Rifkind, because “significant people told you that you weren’t good enough and were to blame and now this comes up every time there’s a conflict”. I wonder if you could try to work out who these significant people might be? “If you could identify who some of these voices were,” says Rifkind, “they might not have the same power or control over you.”

Rifkind and I both liked that you know you communicate best by email. This is sensible and absolutely nothing to feel ashamed of. Many people find it better to reflect and have control over what is said. That one-way “conversation” can also feel safer because you only have to take responsibility for what you say, and not the other person’s reaction, which I think is the thing you may be susceptible to. So email has its place but it can’t be a substitute for all human interaction.

“Conflict is very normal,” says Rifkind, “but many people have difficulty with it and often avoid it or make it worse, by rubbing salt in the wound. We can usually progress, when we have time to think and find a language to communicate that the other person can hear.”

So we think that finding the root of this “shame and guilt” and fear of conflict is a really good idea to help you move forward. But in the moment here are some tips.

Rifkind suggested some tactics to try next time this happens: “You could say something like ‘I’m not sure if I’m comfortable with this, can we talk about it later?’”, to give you time to reflect on what’s happening and calm your nervous system down so you’re not as reactive.

Small silences are a great tool in confrontation. Don’t be afraid to use them to buy yourself some thinking time. Also, a great phrase is “what do you mean by that?” which can encourage both of you to think cognitively rather than reactively.

We often want to lash out, or run away, if we find conflict uncomfortable. With time, you could try to work out what’s your stuff and what’s theirs: you can only take responsibility for your own behaviour and not anyone else’s.

3f2c57a80c,Breitbart,ESPN’s Kirk Herbstreit is ‘Done Giving Any Sh*ts’ Over Criticism of His Stance Against Trans Athletes - Breitbart,"ESPN College GameDay host Kirk Herbstreit says he is done worrying about those who would criticize him over his comments that men should not play in women’s sports.

During a visit with Outkick’s Don’t @ Me! with Dan Dakich, the sports host, said he had spent years staying quiet on the topic, but now he is “done giving any shits” what the critics say.

“I didn’t give a shit, though. I don’t really give a shit at all. Like, I’m done giving any shits at all about any of it,” Herbstreit said about the social media attacks he suffered after criticizing trans athletes in women’s sports.

“It’s almost like there are two different sets of rules, and if you have a view that’s a little bit more traditional — I’m a Christian guy — it’s like there’s a different set of rules for that viewpoint, and it’s hard to just turn the other cheek time after time after time. I didn’t really care,” he continued.

“So, yeah, I didn’t really care, and I don’t care at all, which is a good thing,” he continued. “I think it’s good and healthy to get to that place, compared to, ‘Oh, gosh, I don’t want to get canceled. I don’t want to get people upset.’ I don’t give a s–t. I’m just going to say certain things.”

His remarks caused controversy after he said it was a “ridiculous question” to ask whether men belong in women’s sports.

But he has added that he has already remained quiet on this question for too long.

“I’ve been biting my tongue on a lot of topics for three years,” he told Outkick. “I was just like, I’m just going to give a quick answer, ‘Ridiculous question, of course not.’ I didn’t dwell on it. I didn’t give a like a long answer — that was it, and I didn’t realize it would be way more positive than negative.”

Herbstreit acknowledged that some may be triggered by his comment, saying, “I’m sure people are upset about it. I think it’s kind of a no-brainer. I don’t have a daughter; I have four sons. If I had a daughter, I’d probably be way more outspoken about the discussion on the topic.”

“I’ve tried to stay on the sidelines for a lot of that, but you know, you can only take so much until you want to start to speak up a little bit and actually say what you think. When I retire … I’ll be able to say what I think a lot more,” he insisted.

The question is more relevant than ever after two boxers who reportedly tested with male XY chromosomes were allowed to fight as women in Olympics boxing in Paris and unsurprisingly tore through all the natural-born women to win top honors at the 2024 Games.","A man in a suit stands in front of a blurred background, possibly a sports arena.",<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x117 at 0x7D6BA274A8C0>,2024-08-14 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.breitbart.com,https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2024/08/14/espns-kirk-herbstreit-is-done-giving-any-shts-over-criticism-his-stance-against-trans-athletes/,['Sports' 'Politics'],[0.85 0.7 ],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/3f2c57a80c.png
a2825aab2a,USA TODAY,Diddy's key to New York City rescinded after Cassie Ventura assault video - USA TODAY,"Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' key to New York City has officially been rescinded less than a year after it was issued.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams' office confirmed to USA TODAY on Sunday that the key bestowed upon Diddy in September has been revoked after surveillance footage surfaced that shows the embattled rapper assaulting his then-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, in a hotel hallway in 2016.

In a letter sent to Diddy dated June 4, Adams said he was ""deeply disturbed"" by the video footage and asked him to immediately return the key.

""I strongly condemn these actions and stand in solidarity with all survivors of domestic and gender-based violence,"" the mayor wrote in the letter, which was shared with USA TODAY. ""Our city has worked tirelessly to make sure survivors are heard and seen by our administration.""

The key to New York City is described as ""a beloved symbol of civic recognition and gratitude reserved for individuals whose service to the public and the common good rises to the highest level of achievement.""

But Adams said a committee recommended revoking the key from the music mogul, who since last year has faced multiple allegations of sexual assault.

According to Fabien Levy, deputy mayor for communications, Adams' office received the key back on June 10.

Sean 'Diddy' Combs' legal issues:A timeline of allegations and the rapper's life, career

Diddy, 54, was honored with the key to New York City in a ceremony held in Times Square on Sept. 15. ""I'm a New York boy, and I just got to key to the city, and everything is just a little surreal right now,"" he said at the time.

While introducing Diddy, Adams said that ""the bad boy of entertainment is getting the key to the city from the bad boy of politics.""

Two months later, Ventura sued Diddy for alleged rape, abuse and sex trafficking, and the Bad Boy Records founder subsequently faced additional sexual abuse allegations. Ventura's suit was settled one day after being filed. Diddy's homes were later raided by law enforcement.

In May, surveillance video obtained by CNN showed Diddy assaulting Ventura at a hotel. After the footage's release, Diddy issued an apology without mentioning Ventura's name.

""My behavior on that video is inexcusable,"" he said. ""I take full responsibility for my actions ... I'm disgusted. I was disgusted then when I did it, (and) I'm disgusted now.""

Earlier this month, Howard University rescinded an honorary degree that was presented to Diddy in 2014.

“Mr. Combs' behavior as captured in a recently released video is so fundamentally incompatible with Howard University's core values and beliefs that he is deemed no longer worthy to hold the institution’s highest honor,"" a Howard spokesperson said. ""The university is unwavering in its opposition to all acts of interpersonal violence.""

3ce3d81e3c,Financial Times,Cryptofinance: chasing an AI dream - Financial Times,"Hello and welcome to the FT Cryptofinance newsletter. This week we’re taking a look at a rare industry merger.

We’ve all heard of a merger between companies, but how about a merger of cryptocurrencies? Like its corporate cousin, such a deal comes with an attractive-sounding story about the potential benefits but carries plenty of risks.

The digital asset deal in question is an ambitious three-way combination of the tokens for app platform Fetch.ai, artificial intelligence model provider SingularityNet and data provider Ocean Protocol.

Together they will form the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI) token and its market capitalisation of $6bn would catapult it into the top 20 largest cryptocurrencies.

Behind it is an ambitious plan to create “the AI industry’s largest open-source, decentralised network”, or more simply a play on a convergence between AI and crypto technology.

This is a rather frothy corner of a frothy market. “The intersection of AI and crypto is going to be even bigger than people imagine,” wrote Juan Leon, an analyst at Bitwise. He predicted AI combined with crypto would add $20tn to global GDP by 2030.

But this merger shows how messy reality can be. The plan to go live on Thursday was pushed back a month. Fetch.ai, which is driving the initiative, said it was because exchanges and users needed more time to prepare.

The deal marks a reboot for Fetch.ai, which is run by Humayun Sheikh, a UK entrepreneur and founding investor of DeepMind, the AI lab owned by Google. At the end of last year Fetch.ai ran into financial difficulties and was sold to another Sheikh entity, Assembl.ai. It has since relocated to Dubai.

The thinking behind AI tokens is that blockchains are a way to challenge the handful of Silicon Valley companies already hoovering up resources such as employees, chips and storage, and dominating the market.

This touches on a key investment theme advanced by one of the biggest crypto venture capital firms, Andreessen Horowitz. The thesis is that blockchains can be the platforms to break the grip that big technology companies exert over our personal data (and even our emotions) as they monetise content. As a narrative, it has echoes of bitcoin’s creation as a counter to the financial industry.

Combining crypto and AI, the thinking goes, lets people pool unused processing power or cloud storage and earn a reward for lending it to others. A blockchain can validate AI data, its models and output and make it harder for one entity to wield control over programs.

Fetch.ai’s Sheikh said the deal would give it scale, raising its profile and clout. “If we need to raise funds, we need to get attention, we need to commercialise something, we become much stronger in terms of having that ability,” he said.

But this is a vision with pitfalls, and it is not easy to will a market into existence. Perhaps, as Lenin concluded, grassroots revolutions sometimes need to be led by a vanguard.

It “is a bit of a dilemma we have always been struggling with”, Sheikh admitted. “Once you get the momentum of the developers, it becomes easier to start pushing through.”

Another is that crypto technology may not be a superior offering. In terms of efficiency, the enormous computing power needed for AI can only come from big clusters of centralised data centres. Moreover, large cloud providers have a 20-year head start in developing their service. Decentralised services may not have the size of storage, quality of service or security that a large cloud provider offers users.

The hype may already be fading. A CCData benchmark of similar AI-related coins, including Bittensor, Render and Akash, has returned 65 per cent this year. Even so, that is well down from a return of as much as 226 per cent in March. Better than bitcoin (up 55 per cent) but not as good as Nvidia (171 per cent).

But the thorniest issue overhanging a large merger like this is regulation. Another reason for a delay, Sheikh said, was because ASI had also been seeking clarity from regulators in Singapore.

The merger will be led by the Artificial Superintelligence Foundation, whose main task is to manage and distribute the tokens to the market.

Foundations in IT are not-for-profit organisations that support projects and communities through education or organisation of conferences. For example, the Linux and Apache Foundations promote open source software.

In crypto, foundations usually support particular blockchains. But blockchains come with a native token, an asset of value that could be defined as a security.

ASI’s caution is a further indication that regulators are taking a closer look at the links between foundations and the blockchains they promote.

In March the Swiss-based Ethereum Foundation said it received a confidential inquiry from a state authority. Bloomberg reported that the agency making the request was the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

One executive, speaking anonymously, told me that a few crypto foundations genuinely supported their protocols, but others looked like artificial constructs to get around US definitions of a security.

But not even the regulators are sure and it remains a grey area, another corner of the crypto market that regulators are slowly working their way through.

Weekly highlights

Terraform Labs, the company behind the $40bn collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin in 2022, agreed to pay $4.47bn in a case brought by the SEC.

Swiss regulators opened bankruptcy proceedings against FlowBank, the crypto-friendly Swiss bank.

Final approval by the SEC for exchange traded funds that invest in Ether could come during the summer, Bloomberg reported, citing SEC chair Gary Gensler.

Soundbite of the week:

Donald Trump has been making a play in recent weeks of being the “pro crypto” election candidate, even accepting donations in some coins.

Wiley Nickel, a pro-crypto Democrat, told a conference in New York on Thursday he was having none of it. Via my colleague Nikou Asgari.

“He’s trying to politicise any issue he can that can get him votes . . . He didn’t care about the issue when he was President.”

And finally:

Friday marks the start of the European football championships in Germany. It’s one of my favourite tournaments because an unfancied team is frequently the winner, from the Netherlands (1988), Denmark (1992), Greece (2004) and Portugal (2016). The solid, sensible-as-a-German-footballer’s-haircut choice would be France, but I’m going for Portugal.

4e45a0e474,The New York Times,Boeing Gives F.A.A. Plan to Address Systemic Quality-Control Issues - The New York Times,"Boeing’s top executives delivered a plan to improve quality and safety to the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday, vowing to address systemic issues that have damaged the company’s reputation and put the aircraft manufacturer at the center of several federal investigations.

Boeing detailed these and other steps during a three-hour meeting with the F.A.A.’s administrator, Mike Whitaker, where the company submitted a “comprehensive action plan” that the regulator ordered in February.

Mr. Whitaker had given Boeing 90 days to develop a plan to make sweeping safety improvements after a midcabin panel known as a door plug blew out of a 737 Max 9 jet flying at about 16,000 feet on Jan. 5. No one was seriously injured during the flight.

The F.A.A. said in a statement on Thursday that “senior” leaders from the agency would “meet with Boeing weekly to review their performance metrics, progress and any challenges they’re facing in implementing the changes.”

Boeing was also required to address findings, from an expert panel convened by the F.A.A. last year, that revealed persistent issues with the company’s safety culture. Mr. Whitaker said Boeing had accepted all of the recommendations the panel made in the report.

“We need to see a strong and unwavering commitment to safety and quality that endures over time,” Mr. Whitaker said during a news conference on Thursday. “This is about systemic change, and there’s a lot of work to be done.”

In a statement, Boeing said the action plan it delivered to the F.A.A. was based on feedback it received from employees and through conversations with the regulator. Boeing provided some additional detail on the actions it was taking to improve quality but did not make the safety plan public.

In an email to employees, Stephanie Pope, the head of Boeing’s commercial plane unit and the company’s chief operating officer, said the company is investing in training, simplifying plans and processes, eliminating defects and improving quality and safety.

The company has made some changes, including expanding training for new hires to 14 weeks from 10 weeks; helping managers spend more time on the factory floor and less time in meetings; increasing inspections at Boeing and at a top supplier, and ordering more tools and equipment.

“Many of these actions are underway and our team is committed to executing on each element of the plan,” David Calhoun, Boeing’s chief executive, said in a statement. “It is through this continuous learning and improvement process that our industry has made commercial aviation the safest mode of transportation. The actions we are taking today will further strengthen that foundation.”

The company has also conducted more than 20 meetings at sites around the world, pausing work to gather employee feedback on improving quality. More than 70,000 Boeing workers have participated, providing tens of thousands of comments, the company has said.

Mr. Whitaker, who met on Thursday with Mr. Calhoun, said he planned to continue to meet weekly with Boeing to make sure the actions were executed correctly and in a timely manner. Mr. Whitaker will meet with Boeing’s chief executive in September. Mr. Calhoun has said he plans to step down at the end of the year.

There is no timeline for Boeing to carry out the changes, Mr. Whitaker said.

He also said Boeing had developed six measures by which it and the agency would be able to track the company’s progress. The F.A.A. will also maintain heightened inspections of both Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems, a supplier that makes the bodies of the 737 Max jet. Boeing has said it plans to buy Spirit to gain more control over the quality of the parts it produces for the company.

The action plan is the latest in a series of moves by the F.A.A. to push for safety improvements throughout Boeing. The regulator limited Boeing’s monthly production of 737 Max jets and audited its production lines, and is investigating the company’s compliance with federal safety standards.

Mr. Whitaker said the F.A.A. would continue to put limits on Boeing until the agency was satisfied with the company’s progress. The regulator and Boeing have not yet discussed raising the number of Max jets that Boeing can produce in a month beyond 38, he said. Boeing is making the planes at well below that rate, but has said it hopes to accelerate production in the second half of the year.

“We will not approve production increases beyond the current cap until we’re satisfied,” Mr. Whitaker said during the news conference. “Bottom line, we will continue to make sure every airplane that comes off the line is safe and reliable.”

The Justice Department has also opened a criminal investigation into the Jan. 5 episode. A preliminary investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board suggested that the Max 9 plane might have left Boeing’s factory in Renton, Wash., without the panel bolted down.

Boeing also faces potential legal repercussions from crashes involving its planes. The Justice Department said this month that Boeing had violated a 2021 settlement reached after two 737 Max plane crashes killed hundreds in 2018 and 2019, and could be prosecuted on a criminal charge of conspiracy to defraud the F.A.A.

The Justice Department found that Boeing had failed to “design, implement and enforce” a compliance and ethics program that was a condition of the settlement. The company plans to contest the department’s determination.

That 2021 settlement had been criticized for being too lenient on Boeing and for being struck without consulting the families of the 346 people killed in the Max crashes, which were in Indonesia and Ethiopia and led to the grounding of the 737 Max fleet for 20 months. An investigation determined that both crashes involved the mistaken triggering of a maneuvering system designed to help avert stalls in flight.",An airplane with the registration number N704AL is shown with a red staircase leading to the cockpit.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x117 at 0x7D6BA4963B80>,2024-05-30 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/30/us/politics/boeing-faa-quality-control-plan.html,['National' 'Business and Finance'],[0.9 0.8],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/4e45a0e474.png
9c511706ae,National Review,"Chevron Exec: ‘In Texas, We’re Welcome’ - National Review","Chevron, one of the largest U.S. energy companies, announced on August 2 that it would be moving its headquarters from California to Texas. For a company that was once named Standard Oil of California, the move is significant, and emblematic of California’s hostility to the energy industry.

Andy Walz is president of Chevron’s American products group, which covers North, Central, and South America. He spoke to journalists in an online meeting on Thursday about the headquarters move and energy policy more broadly.

“I think California is playing a dangerous game,” Walz said. “I’ve said this many, many times, and I’m going to keep saying it.”

All California businesses face higher taxes than they would in other states, and employees face higher costs of living. But the problems are especially severe for energy companies.

California is on an “energy island,” Walz said. It is isolated from the national pipeline network. “You can’t take a ship from the rest of the U.S. to California because of a thing called Jones Act shipping,” he said. As a result, Californians pay higher prices for energy than residents of other states, and the cost of doing business for energy companies is higher as well.

“Chevron has a proud history in California. We have two big refineries, we have a large retail network,” Walz said. But the shift of the firm’s headquarters from California to Texas has been underway for years. Last week’s announcement made it official.

Walz said Chevron’s strategy for developing leadership within the company involves moving people around to see all angles of the firm’s business. He said he has had probably 15 different roles within the company, and that exposure to the company’s headquarters is always going to be part of that journey.

“We have a lot of people who will not move to California,” Walz said. He cited cost of living and the tax environment as deterrents to employees wanting to live in the state. He said that although Chevron has many lifelong California residents as employees, and will continue to, the company was having a hard time getting employees who did not already live in California to move there.

“In Texas, we’re welcome. Our industry is welcome,” Walz said. “The policies are welcoming of energy companies.” Walz said he has lived in Houston for about a year, and the cost of living there is more appealing to Chevron employees.

“This isn’t politically motivated,” he said of the headquarters move. “We are trying to create better business outcomes.” He pointed to three California policies that have made the state uncompetitive for energy companies: the phased-in ban on internal-combustion-engine cars set to arrive in full in 2035, the windfall profits tax, and cap-and-trade.

“Those three regulations, those three policies, really make it hard for me to want to put more capital into the state of California,” Walz said. “Therefore, I think the business case there is really challenging.”

“California can’t get supply from Houston,” Walz said. It’s easier for California refineries to get oil from Korea, China, or India than it is to get it from elsewhere in the U.S., he said.

Walz said there were 40 refineries in California around 1980. Today there are nine. And the regulatory environment isn’t hostile only to major, dirty projects like refineries. “It’s hard to build a gas station,” Walz said.

“We supply 60 percent of the jet fuel for San Francisco airport from our Richmond refinery,” Walz said. If that were to close in the future, the most likely alternative would be imports from abroad, because of government policy preventing the transportation of American petroleum products from the Gulf Coast to California.

Chevron CEO Mike Wirth has said in the past that he doubts a new refinery will ever be built in the United States. No major ones have been built since the 1970s. Walz echoed Wirth’s sentiment, though he noted that Chevron is investing in improvements on existing refineries in Texas.

That doesn’t mean the oil industry is going away, in Walz’s view. “We see the demand for energy continuing to grow,” he said.

He brushed aside concerns about peak oil demand that some have raised as a deterrent to industry investment. “I’ve been in this for a long time, and I’ve heard people talk about peak oil for a long time, and it just seems to keep getting pushed out,” he said.

“Today there are 2.5 billion people living below the poverty line,” Walz said, speaking of global poverty standards. “Those people are going to want to enjoy the things that you and I enjoy,” he said, and those things require affordable and reliable energy. He also pointed to the increased energy demands from new technologies, such as artificial-intelligence data centers.

On federal policy, Walz said, “We would like consistent policy from both parties that we can rely on. When the policies move around, people get nervous.” He said the length of a presidential term is not enough time for major investments in the energy industry to pay off, so policy can’t shift with each administration.","A Chevron gas station sign with a 'with TECHRON' logo, showing gas prices for regular, plus, and supreme, and an 'Auto Service' sign in front of it.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x131 at 0x7D6BA3BBEF20>,2024-08-08 21:15:58+00:00,https://www.nationalreview.com,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/chevron-exec-in-texas-were-welcome/,['Business and Finance' 'National'],[0.85 0.65],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/9c511706ae.png
77d95eff27,The Washington Post,How the Libertarian Party that turned from Trump came to embrace him - The Washington Post,"Nick Sarwark was worried.

Ahead of the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017, the then-chair of the Libertarian Party was increasingly concerned that a faction of his party supported white supremacy. Sarwark fired off a public letter saying racism didn’t belong in the party and asking others to join in his condemnation of fascism and of the rising popularity of Donald Trump among libertarians.

The letter was eventually signed by more than 400 people and groups, but it set off a firestorm among others.

Outrage over Sarwark’s accusations fueled the rise of a right-wing contingent that eventually took control of the party leadership. Now, that new leadership has invited Trump to their convention stage, ripping open old wounds and angering party members who have not embraced the former president. The division spilled out in public Saturday night, as Trump encountered booing and heckling during his speech despite pleas from the party’s leadership for delegates to behave.

The Trump invitation is the latest battle in a raging, contentious war over the party’s direction. Libertarians have traditionally advocated for less government intervention in people’s lives and more focus on individual freedoms — issues where they at times have found common ground with Republicans. But some of Trump’s actions — including his taking a hard line at the southern border, hiking tariffs that restrict free trade and promoting military hawks — are starkly at odds with the libertarian ethos. Those disagreements fueled chanting from Libertarians who called him a “hypocrite” and “liar” during his speech.

Trump is the presumptive presidential nominee of the Republican Party, and as such, it is highly unusual to have him speaking at a rival party’s national convention. Libertarians plan to choose their own presidential nominee this weekend who will eventually face the former president on the ballot in November. Party leaders have said they will not endorse Trump, but he sought to recruit their members to his camp in Saturday’s speech. He suggested that the party should nominate him “only if you want to win.”

“Maybe you don’t want to win,” Trump said to booing from the audience of mostly Libertarian delegates. There were about 200 Trump supporters who visited the convention to hear Trump speak attempting to drown out the Libertarians with pro-Trump chants. Although much of his speech faced loud criticism from the Libertarian audience, he did lobby the party with major promises, committing to put a Libertarian in his cabinet and pardon Ross Ulbricht, the mastermind behind the online drug market Silk Road, who was sentenced to life in prison in 2015.

“Donald Trump came here because he needs our votes to win,” Sarwark said, adding that Trump didn’t pardon Ulbricht in his first term. “He gave red meat to our delegates, but what he doesn’t realize is we’re libertarians. We know he’s a liar.”

Some members who align more closely with Sarwark are hoping to recall the party’s current administration using similar tactics deployed in the 2022 takeover. But supporters of the ruling faction, the Mises Caucus, say their efforts to bring Trump to the convention will spur newfound interest in the party as it experiences declining membership. The Libertarian Party is the third-largest political party but has a small fraction of the registered voters that the Democratic and Republican parties have.

Whom Libertarians chose as their presidential nominee was a major litmus test of the party’s trajectory, according to interviews with two dozen current and former members of the party. The party on Sunday did not pick the Mises Caucus’s preferred candidate, Michael Rectenwald, a former New York University professor who faced backlash and left his job after he invited controversial far-right commentator Milo Yiannopoulos to speak to his class. While the Mises Caucus has faced criticism, several attendees at the convention Friday said that it was doing well leading the national party despite some disagreements and that they would vote for Rectenwald.

But critics of the Mises Caucus and the decision to invite the former president say that the party’s leaders have grown too cozy with Trump-aligned figures and that Rectenwald has offered Trump-esque proposals, such as shutting the southern border. The Classic Liberal Caucus, a left-leaning faction more closely aligned with Sarwark’s beliefs, endorsed Chase Oliver, a political activist who ran in the 2022 Georgia special Senate election and who won the nomination after numerous rounds of voting.

“I do truly believe we will have a new Libertarian Party in June,” said Mike Coogan, chair of the Harris County, Tex., chapter of the Libertarian Party, who supports Oliver. “I don’t know which way it will swing.”

Where it started

After Charlottesville, Mises Caucus founder Michael Heise began vigorously recruiting for the new caucus — named for the late Austrian-born economist Ludwig von Mises — appealing to Libertarians who had been drawn to the party by Rep. Ron Paul (R-Tex.). Heise has said his interest in new Libertarian leadership stemmed from his objections to Sarwark and other leaders’ decisions, including supporting the 2016 Libertarian presidential ticket of former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson and former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, both former Republicans who had vocally objected to Trump.

Heise and the Mises leadership promised members they could resolve dysfunction that has perpetually plagued the party and recruit more people to join. In 2020, Heise and the Mises Caucus went to the party’s national convention in New Orleans, hoping to gain control of party leadership, but they were unsuccessful.

The growing coronavirus pandemic, however, would prove to be a newly motivating force for them.

The Mises Caucus began to recruit heavily from online groups, signing up former Republicans. One key argument they made for new leadership was dissatisfaction with the party’s stance on the coronavirus, saying libertarians needed to more forcefully push back against public health mandates — an argument that resonated in more conservative and pro-Trump circles.

“The general message was that the current leadership was corrupt and they weren’t real Libertarians,” said John Hudak, a former Mises Caucus member who agreed with their argument that the party should be more libertarian but left over disagreements with far-right personalities leading the caucus. “The fact that they had something to rally against so strongly is what worked.”

But the effort to recruit people fed up with pandemic restrictions also brought backlash. The New Hampshire Libertarian Party’s social media accounts garnered critical headlines over offensive posts, including a 2021 tweet that read “John McCain’s brain tumor saved more lives than Anthony S. Fauci.” Fauci remains a common target of vitriol among Trump supporters who are highly critical of the government’s response to the coronavirus. Trump once called Fauci “a disaster.”

After the tweet, Joe Bishop-Henchman, then the party’s chair, moved to remove the state party’s national recognition — but the motion failed. Bishop-Henchman resigned in the summer of 2021, writing that “toxic people are tolerated” in the party and that he had become “convinced that many in this party want that toxicity.”

Sarwark said he realized the Mises Caucus would soon take over the party when two charter buses rolled up to the Pennsylvania state convention in 2022 and people he didn’t recognize overtook the gathering. Sarwark, who typically brought his two children to libertarian meetings, was aghast when two members got into a fistfight. He pulled his family out and swore to never bring his children to another convention.

But Sarwark was realizing he didn’t fit in at the conventions, either.

What happened in Reno

Some who stayed with the party had hoped for the best. Erik Raudsep, who ran for vice chair in 2022, at the time had heard about new party members recruited through YouTube and Facebook. He had been endorsed by several states’ Mises Caucus chapters, and as he traveled to state conventions, he thought it could be a good thing that he was seeing so many unfamiliar faces. But he realized some of the people he encountered harbored bigoted beliefs — something that felt out of the ordinary. In New Hampshire, he was shocked when he heard some men telling a woman fundraising for the party that she didn’t belong there.

“I personally thought they had a lot of things that they could contribute to the party,” Raudsep said. “But as time progressed, certain individuals got involved in it, and their recruiting practices, which was wildly successful, didn’t bring individuals who understood or espoused libertarian values.”

Still, other states had a more seamless transition of power. Mark Rutherford, who chaired the Indiana state party, said the Mises Caucus that took over his state party has worked well with others. But he said there are national Mises Caucus members who have sowed division, and that’s why he ran to unseat Angela McArdle as chair this convention. Still, McArdle won with 53 percent of the vote.

As delegates descended on the national convention in Reno in 2022, the Mises Caucus representatives came armed with a 70-page packet telling them how to vote, according to a version of the document obtained by The Washington Post.

The caucus also planned to change the party’s platforms, including deleting long-standing planks that “government should be kept out” of abortion and “individuals should not be unreasonably constrained” by borders. The caucus’s delegates also supported the removal of language that said that “we condemn bigotry as irrational and repugnant” and replacing it with “we uphold and defend the rights of every person, regardless of their race, ethnicity and any other aspect of their identity.”

Mises Caucus members were told the bigotry and abortion planks needed to go because “this … will display that there are serious cultural changes in the party that are more representative of” a movement against “wokeness” — a blanket term opponents use to describe topics related to diversity and sexual orientation and other cultural touchpoints — according to the strategy document. Those changes were all indicative of a closer alignment with Trump, who has given varied answers about government intervention into reproductive care and in recent weeks said decisions about abortion should be left to the states. He has also been a vocal proponent of increased enforcement at the southern border and railed against wokeness.

Mises Caucus members eventually successfully voted to remove the abortion, border and bigotry-related planks from the party’s platform.

Since that 2022 convention, the party has faced existential concerns.

In August 2022, the New Mexico Libertarian Party disaffiliated with the national party for behavior that the state’s chair, Chris Luchini, wrote repelled “vast swaths of the American people from ever joining.” Others have since distanced themselves from the party as well.

Declining membership has exacerbated the party’s financial woes. In 2022, the party raised more than $2 million in revenue, but that dropped to $1.1 million last year.

McArdle has assured members that Trump and other speakers will draw attention to the party. She told The Post that the convention’s sales ticked up after the announcement of the former president’s appearance, but she declined to share numbers. After his speech, she credited his attendance with boosting the national recognition of the party. She also referred to his promise to pardon Ulbricht.

“I think that if we accomplished nothing else as libertarians, if that happens, it will be the hugest accomplishment we’ve ever had,” she said Sunday.

Critics say she is only helping Trump, who hopes to gain votes that might otherwise go to a Libertarian candidate in close races. Her critics have specifically pointed to an interview McArdle did after the announcement, in which she said that while her loyalty was to Libertarians, “Donald Trump is a much better person and president than Joe Biden.”","A large gathering of people in a conference room, some standing and some seated, with a man in a blue shirt gesturing towards a table with papers and a laptop.

db717478db,The Guardian,The History of Ideas by David Runciman review – casting around - The Guardian,"When is a book not a book? When it’s the book of a podcast. David Runciman, professor of politics at Cambridge and formerly co-host of Talking Politics (with the excellent Helen Thompson), now issues a podcast called History of Ideas, and this is the second, after 2022’s Confronting Leviathan, in what is promised or threatened to be a “series” of books based on it. “I have tried to retain the conversational style of the original podcasts, though each chapter has been extensively rewritten and adapted,” the author explains in a preface. The result is not just a transcription of a podcast, but nor is it really a book.

A dozen thinkers get a chapter each: Joseph Schumpeter on democracy, John Rawls on justice, Jeremy Bentham on utilitarianism, Friedrich Nietzsche on the genealogy of morals, Simone de Beauvoir on feminism, and so forth. What will most strike the reader hoping to engage with a real book is the almost complete lack of direct quotation from the thinkers discussed. We are simply expected to take on trust that “Hobbes believes that …” or “[Rosa] Luxemburg thought …” The 19th-century former slave and abolitionist Frederick Douglass is described as a “miraculously good” writer, but we don’t get a single example. What about another miraculously good writer, Friedrich Nietzsche? “His two catchphrases are ‘God is dead’ and ‘The will to power’.”

This absence of quotation represents a patrician condescension to the reader, as if Runciman’s imagined readership could not handle reading what these people actually wrote and need it relentlessly paraphrased in CliffsNotes form. It also excuses Runciman himself from ever having to demonstrate, with textual evidence, why he claims a certain writer “thinks” this or that.

Unhappily, too, the refusal to cite the works under discussion sands away all the idiosyncrasies and personal brilliances of their authors: everything is translated into the monotonous murmur of a placid 21st-century liberal speaking down to the kids about Donald Trump, smartphones, Greta Thunberg, or the social network formerly known as Twitter. Such subjects pop up periodically as groovy-uncle attempts to make the philosophers seem pertinent to “our” interests, along with cool references to 1990s alt-rock (“there are a lot of jagged little pills to swallow”).

Runciman panders embarrassingly to an imagined audience of anti-intellectuals. We are reassured patronisingly that Bentham and John Rawls are not “ivory tower” thinkers, but Robert Nozick is “probably too clever by half”. In this discussion of 12 philosophers, we ought not to attach much value to philosophy itself. “Rawls was a professional political philosopher, not simply an intellectual or a writer,” Runciman notes, “and sometimes it feels as though the philosophy took priority over the writing.” No examples of the writing are given.

Helping with this ambition to denigrate the merely intellectual is a style of verbose cliche: one book is “an incredibly wide-ranging, sweeping analysis” (rest assured “there are twists and turns along the way”), another idea “feels like a bigger ask”. At one comical point Runciman castigates Simone de Beauvoir for being insufficiently woke: her view on the difference between men’s and women’s novels is, he laments, “the sort of thing a man would say”.

Despite the relentless – and, some might say, flagrantly unhistorical – attempts to make his subjects seem relevant to modern politics, Runciman neglects one obvious parallel. His earnest defence of Bentham’s utilitarianism – he is, apparently, “a hero for our times” – does not mention its modern transmutation into the school of “effective altruism”, an approach that has of late rather careered off the rails following the giant crypto fraud perpetrated by its notorious adherent Sam Bankman-Fried. Not to mention “longtermism”, meaning, according to some followers, that we ought to privilege the future lives of trillions over the mere billions living today. In the world of History of Ideas, though, nothing is quite so troubling: all is at last calm and frictionless, like the soothing tones of a podcast while you are stacking the dishwasher.","An exhibit featuring a man in a 19th-century outfit seated on a chair, with a sign reading 'Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832)' next to him.

c5814a090e,The New York Times,"Trump Stays Quiet (Relatively), Hoping Biden Stays in the Race - The New York Times","Amid the flurry of Democrats’ questioning whether President Biden should or will remain his party’s presidential nominee, former President Donald J. Trump has stayed unusually quiet on the issue publicly.

Mr. Trump, rarely one to shy away from sharing his opinion, has not been fully silent since last week’s debate, giving a handful of radio interviews and keeping up a steady stream of posts and videos on his social media platform, Truth Social. But Mr. Trump has largely sat back and allowed the Democratic Party to dominate the debate over Mr. Biden’s political future, in a signal of his preferred opponent.

After months of relentlessly attacking Mr. Biden as too physically and mentally weak to lead the country, the former president has been content to let the news coverage of Democrats’ doubting their party’s leader take hold, according to two advisers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategy.

His relative lack of public comments on the issue also to some extent reflects his desire for Mr. Biden to stay in the race and his confidence that he can easily beat the president in November, one of the advisers said.

A New York Times/Siena College poll conducted after the debate and released on Wednesday suggested that some Republican voters agreed: 28 percent of them said they thought Mr. Biden should remain the Democratic nominee, an uptick from 21 percent in a poll conducted before the debate.

On Monday, Mr. Trump publicly dismissed the idea that the president would be replaced on the Democratic ticket.

“If you listen to the professionals that do this stuff, they say it’s very hard for anybody else to come into the race,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with John Reid, a Virginia-based talk radio host.

What you should know. The Times makes a careful decision any time it uses an anonymous source. The information the source supplies must be newsworthy and give readers genuine insight.

And in an echo of a talking point that Mr. Biden’s Democratic allies have long wielded to argue that he is best positioned to beat the former president, Mr. Trump has also argued that polling showed that “Biden does better than the people they’re talking about using to replace him.”

The day after the debate, he argued at a rally in Virginia that Mr. Biden polled better in head-to-head matchups against him than did either Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he said he would “be very happy” to run against, or Michelle Obama, the former first lady.

Two polls released on Tuesday somewhat deflated that claim: A CNN poll found that Ms. Harris polled two percentage points ahead of Mr. Biden in a hypothetical contest against Mr. Trump, though he still defeated her. And an Ipsos/Reuters poll found that Mrs. Obama — a long-shot potential option for Democrats given that she has repeatedly said she has no interest in running — beat Mr. Trump, 50 percent to 39 percent, in a hypothetical matchup.

Mr. Trump did appear to delight in mocking his rival in a raw video first reported by The Daily Beast on Wednesday and later shared by Mr. Trump. It was not clear who originally shot the clip or what day it was filmed. As he golfed on his property in New Jersey, Mr. Trump referred to Mr. Biden as “that old broken down pile of crap” and suggested he would quit the race, according to the video of his comments.

If Mr. Biden stepped aside, Mr. Trump would lose two lines of attack that have been central to his campaign. He has spent years attacking Mr. Biden as “sleepy,” posting videos of Mr. Biden’s stumbles, mocking his speech and performing cartoonish imitations of him, attacks that he could not easily deploy against another opponent.

And for the last several months, Mr. Trump has tried to appeal to undecided voters by directly comparing his time in office with Mr. Biden’s, often in misleading terms. That message would be hamstrung if another candidate replaced Mr. Biden on the ticket.

A new opponent could open up new political challenges. Mr. Trump could face a younger opponent who could appeal to voters worried about both candidates’ ages and looking for fresh alternatives to two men who each have had a shot at a White House term.

“I don’t think anybody in the Trump campaign has ever said they want Biden off the ticket,” said Corey Lewandowski, a longtime Trump adviser who is now an adviser for the Republican Party’s nominating convention. He added that the matchup of “two candidates who America both knows very well and has a record to compare is one that favors us very, very much.”

The Heritage Foundation, a major conservative group, has also been exploring possible legal challenges it could mount that would make it difficult to replace Mr. Biden on the ballot in some states if he withdrew.

Mike Howell, the executive director of Heritage’s Oversight Project, said the group was eyeing key battleground states like Georgia, Nevada and Wisconsin where laws might make it difficult to put a different Democrat on the ballot.

In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Trump’s two campaign managers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, expressed their confidence that Mr. Trump could “beat any Democrat” in November. They accused Democrats now turning on Mr. Biden of being hypocrites, saying that “every one of them has lied about Joe Biden’s cognitive state and supported his disastrous policies over the past four years.”

There have been signs that some people in Mr. Trump’s orbit are preparing more seriously for the possibility, however distant, of a matchup against another Democratic candidate this fall. The Trump campaign and Republican allies have ramped up attacks on Ms. Harris, who has long been a target of the right.

In their statement on Wednesday, Mr. Trump’s campaign managers called her “Cackling Copilot Kamala Harris,” both mocking her mannerisms and directly linking her to Mr. Biden’s policies. During the debate, the campaign ran an ad suggesting that Mr. Biden was incapable of leading the country through a second term and warning that Ms. Harris was waiting in the wings to take over.

On Tuesday morning, Make America Great Again Inc., the leading super PAC supporting Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign, sent out a list of attacks on Ms. Harris that essentially argued that she would be no better than Mr. Biden, particularly on immigration, an issue Mr. Trump has made central to his campaign.

On Wednesday, the campaign committee for House Republicans announced a new digital ad that linked Ms. Harris to Mr. Biden’s border policies. “Vote Republican. Stop Kamala,” a title card at the end of the ad reads.

“Every good campaign looks at every possible contingency,” Mr. Lewandowski said. “The campaign’s strategy isn’t shifting, but it would be a dereliction of duty to not be prepared should Joe Biden drop out of the race.”

In the video clip at his golf club, Mr. Trump nonetheless was already looking past Mr. Biden to Ms. Harris as his likely opponent.","A man in a dark suit and red tie stands on stage with a microphone stand in front of him, with a woman in a black dress to his left and a dark background.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x117 at 0x7D6B7E86E0E0>,2024-07-04 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/04/us/politics/trump-biden-replacement-candidate.html,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/c5814a090e.png
f631f3225d,Fox News,Homemaker influencer defends Harrison Butker after speech backlash: Traditional women aren't 'oppressed' - Fox News,"A popular Arizona online influencer believes stay-at-home mothers are often derided in today's social-media-fixated, me-first culture. So when NFL kicker Harrison Butker's viral commencement address praising homemaking as one of the most important vocations for women caused an uproar, she wasn't surprised.

""I think a lot of people have just been trained, and I was kind of like this too, even growing up, hearing about how important it is for women to have degrees and to have jobs and go compete with men,"" 28-year-old Ivy Van Dusen and ""trad wife"" told Fox News Digital. ""So I think people subconsciously when they hear the word homemaker, or when they hear someone, especially a man, talk about women being mothers, flags go up, and they automatically are upset by it.""

Van Dusen makes videos on social media sharing about her life as a homemaker and stay-at-home mom of two children. On her TikTok account, @ivyoutwest, the young mother shares with her 100,000+ followers why she finds her traditional lifestyle more fulfilling than pursuing a career in the corporate world.

""I genuinely think that they think that we're just dumb, and we don't understand that it's oppressive to be at home and to depend on a man financially and that we should be doing so much more,"" she said. ""I think that's just a misconception, because a lot of stay-at-home moms I know are educated, have had careers … We do it consciously, knowing that it's a lifestyle that's worth it for us.""

Butker's May 11 address at Benedictine College, a small Catholic college in Kansas, has generated considerable debate, support and backlash around the country. Media coverage, which has been largely negative, has focused particularly on his remarks addressed to women graduating that day and how they'd been told ""diabolical lies.""

""Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world. I can tell you that my beautiful wife Isabelle would be the first to say that her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother,"" he said.

""I’m on this stage today and able to be the man I am because I have a wife who leans into her vocation. I’m beyond blessed with the many talents God has given me. But it cannot be overstated, that all of my success is made possible because a girl I met in band class back in middle school would convert to the faith, become my wife and embrace one of the most important titles of all: homemaker.""

Everything from Butker's observance of the Traditional Latin Mass – one ""View"" co-host called it ""cult-like"" – to his position – a Washington Post sports columnist suggested mocking him for being the Kansas City Chiefs placekicker – has come under fire from the left.

A CNN reporter even asked Biden press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre if Butker would be welcome at the White House when the Chiefs came later this year to celebrate their Super Bowl title; she replied the whole team was invited.

The NFL officially distanced itself from him, saying Butker's remarks clashed with the league's on ""inclusion."" Even usually chipper NBC host Hoda Kotb said the speech put her in a bad mood last week on ""Today with Hoda & Jenna.""

DEGREE-HOLDING WOMEN DEFEND CHIEFS KICKER AMID COMMENCEMENT SPEECH BACKLASH: ‘MORE WIVES AND MOTHERS PLEASE'

""Don’t speak for us,"" Kotb said. ""Stop speaking for women out there.""

But many other women, with college degrees, are backing Butker's remarks.

Van Dusen, who was raised in a Mormon family, said she felt pressured by society to pursue a degree, and go compete with men"" in the workforce. While attending Brigham Young University, she met her husband and got married at 19. The couple welcomed their first child just after Van Dusen graduated with her degree in broadcast journalism.

While she loved journalism and wanted to pursue a career in it, she felt it was more important for her to stay home with her son, especially while he was young.

""My husband was really supportive in that,"" she told Fox News Digital.

But it hasn’t always been easy.

""We have had to be extremely frugal, especially those first years … but it's been good,"" she said.

Besides making videos on social media about her family and lifestyle, she is passionate about helping to support other mothers through her blog and her volunteer work with Postpartum Support International. She also competes in beauty pageants and was the 2023 winner of the Mrs. Arizona America pageant for married women, which is the official state preliminary for the Mrs. America Pageant.

Happy about her decision to be a homemaker, Van Dusen works to support other moms regardless of their educational background.

ROBIN ROBERTS HAS AWKWARD EXCHANGE ON ‘GOOD MORNING AMERICA’ WHILE DISCUSSING HARRISON BUTKER'S SPEECH

""It’s socially acceptable to support women and cheer for them when it comes to work and when it comes to careers,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""But it's not really socially acceptable to support them at home. And I think people are just kind of trying to see that as oppressive and degrading, which I just couldn't disagree more with.""

When she first heard about Butker's speech in the media, she thought it had amounted to a jock athlete telling women to ""go back to the kitchen.""

""I actually thought it was awesome,"" she said of his speech. ""I was just seeing negativity about it. It was hard to find the actual speech itself because I would just see clips of it and people reacting to it and news organizations covering it.""

The address on Benedictine's YouTube page has garnered more than 1.6 million views as of Sunday. The portion that has caused the most controversy regarding women and motherhood was ""actually the part that I love the most,"" she said.

""I know that's controversial to say, but for me, it was something that I wish I had heard more of when I was, you know, eight months pregnant, graduating [from college],"" she said.

Butker did not simply address women with his remarks about the importance of parenting and family. He also said he had embraced his own vocation to be a husband and father and encouraged men to be ""unapologetic in your masculinity.""

CHIEFS' HARRISON BUTKER ‘SAID NOTHING WRONG’ DURING FAITH-BASED COMMENCEMENT SPEECH RELIGIOUS GROUP SAYS

Butker also criticized Pride month, which celebrates LGBT pride, and instead encouraged listeners to exhibit ""God-centered pride that is cooperating with the Holy Ghost to glorify Him."" In addition, he criticized President Biden, who is Roman Catholic, for being pro-abortion, calling such identities incompatible.

While Butker has thrust himself into the zeitgeist with his speech, the Georgia native has made a name for himself on the field since joining the league in 2017. Picked in the seventh and final round of the NFL draft by the Carolina Panthers, he was later signed by the Chiefs and has been the starting kicker for three Super Bowl championship teams.

3d301a39ab,The Guardian,The violence was shocking but not surprising: Britain’s economy makes it ripe for far-right thuggery | Larry Elliott - The Guardian,"Rachel Reeves has been in the US this week trying to lure investment into the UK. Good luck with that, chancellor. With racist riots occurring nightly, it is perhaps not the best time to be declaring that Britain is open for business.

Rather, the message likely to be picked up on the other side of the Atlantic is that Britain is awash with thuggery, that xenophobia is rampant and that the country’s economy is broken. The government seems to have been taken by surprise by the far-right violence.

Britain is not remotely close to the “inevitable” civil war Elon Musk has been talking about, but it says something when Nigeria, Australia and Indonesia start cautioning their citizens about the dangers of travelling to the UK. The hatred shown on the streets has been vile and shocking, and threatens to do serious damage to Britain’s international reputation.

Let’s be clear: mass arrests followed by punitive sentences are necessary and justified. Rioters are responsible for their own actions – and what they are doing is criminal, pure and simple. I was a magistrate back in 2011, the last time there was serious widespread disorder, and the message received from on high was that we should crack down hard. A similar message will have gone out this time, with harsh sentences meted out for offences that would normally be treated far more leniently.

A trickier question is whether this is an example of the sort of hooliganism that has led in the past to riotous behaviour when the England football team has been playing abroad or whether it is a symptom of a deeper malaise. If it is the former, tough sentences for the perpetrators may work. If it is the latter, there is a much bigger problem, and banging people up and throwing away the key won’t be enough to restore harmony to the many parts of England where violence has erupted. A clampdown on the social media companies that have been accused of helping the perpetrators orchestrate their actions is also not a silver bullet.

It would be unquestionably easier to decide that this is simply a case of rooting out a few hundred rotten apples, because it avoids the need to address thornier issues such as inequality, the increase in working-age poverty and the impact of immigration on pay and public services. Put simply: is Britain a country where the conditions are ripe to be exploited by the far right? The answer, sadly, is that it probably is.

For years, charities and thinktanks have been warning that this is a country where the gulf between the haves and the have-nots is enormous. Just this week, the Resolution Foundation – a thinktank that focuses on issues affecting those on low and middle incomes – published a report showing that regional inequalities have not narrowed at all in the past 25 years. Poor places have remained poor and rich places rich. As far as child poverty is concerned, things have got worse. In 2014-15, 19 of the 20 child poverty hotspots were in London, but by 2022-23, only three remained in the capital, with the rest split between the north-west and West Midlands.

There has been no rioting in places such as Cambridge, no attacks on asylum seekers in Winchester or St Albans – and it is not hard to see why. These are the parts of the country where people have well-paid jobs and comfortable lives, and where the biggest cause for concern is whether bits of the green belt are going to be developed under Labour’s housebuilding plan. If, by some miracle, Reeves does persuade US entrepreneurs to put their money in the UK, these are the sort of prosperous places where it will go.

It almost certainly won’t go to Rotherham, Middlesbrough, Stoke-on-Trent or Hartlepool – four of the towns where rioting has been the most furious – despite the fact that they are in greater need of the boost that investment provides. These are all classic examples of post-industrial Britain – places that had the heart of their economies ripped out in the 1980s and 90s, and where the factories have been replaced by call centres and distribution warehouses. They have suffered more than most from the austerity imposed after the 2010 election.

Add in a decade or more of flatlining real wages, a cost of living crisis and legal migration reaching a record level in 2022 and you get a highly combustible mixture. These are the towns and cities that voted for Brexit in the expectation that things would change, and they didn’t. They were seduced by Boris Johnson’s idea that he would level up Britain after the 2019 election and were again sold a pup. Faith in the state is at rock-bottom levels. Respect for the police has drained away. Asylum seekers and migrants more generally have become the scapegoats for discontent. More worrying perhaps than the pictures of racists hurling bricks are the bystanders – not actively involved but appearing to be willing them on.

Make no mistake: nothing justifies attacking a mosque or a hotel where asylum seekers are housed – not benefit cuts, nor the loss of a job or longer NHS waiting lists. Yet, as I said back in 2011, we are kidding ourselves if we think a spell under lock and key – even when richly deserved – is going to solve deep-seated problems.

To imagine that economic and social factors play no part in what has happened over the past week or so is to inhabit the farthest shores of fantasy island. To borrow a phrase, the government needs to be tough on riots, tough on the causes of riots.","A crowd of people, one holding a sign that reads 'Can't afford rent?

1c1fee7783,CNN,US and key allies debating what commitment to give on Ukraine joining NATO at upcoming summit - CNN,"The United States and several key allies, including the United Kingdom, are actively debating how strongly to commit to Ukraine’s NATO membership at the alliance’s upcoming 75th anniversary summit in Washington, with the US facing criticism from a variety of European countries for not being willing to go as far as several – especially those close to Russia’s border – would like, according to multiple US and European sources familiar with the discussions.

US and German officials have proposed that the alliance pledge during next month’s summit that Ukraine has a “bridge” to NATO membership, rather than an “irreversible path” as NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in April in language that is favored by the UK and several Eastern and Central European nations, multiple sources familiar with the discussions told CNN.

The eventual language issued by the alliance about Ukraine during July’s summit in Washington is critical. It will be painstakingly debated by the allies in the days leading up and then heavily scrutinized, as it will outline to the world – Russia in particular – what the goals are for Ukraine within NATO.

“At the (Washington) Summit, we’ll be taking concrete steps to bring Ukraine closer to NATO and ensure that there’s a bridge to membership, a bridge that’s strong and well-lit,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a NATO Foreign Ministerial in Prague in late May.

A senior US official said that Biden administration officials do not think the word “irreversible” would get the support of the entire alliance, pointing in particular to Hungary as a likely holdout. The official said the US believes they are close to a resolution with all allies on the language but declined to preview the decision.

Some NATO members are also reluctant to use the word because Ukraine has yet to implement all of the necessary democratic and anti-corruption reforms necessary for membership, a separate US official said.

With the summit about a month away, the topic remains a central point of tension in ongoing conversations.

“Most Central European countries are disappointed by the Biden administration’s ambiguity and procrastination” when it comes to outlining a concrete pathway forward for Ukraine, a Central European diplomat told CNN.

A second European official whose country is more aggressive on Ukraine’s membership than the US said that European allies have been directly lobbying the White House to make Ukraine’s pathway as clear as possible.

“We instinctively feel a new path should be laid out,” the second official said. “Fast tracking [Ukraine’s membership] should be looked at.”

In April, Stoltenberg told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv that “the work we are undertaking now puts you on an irreversible path towards NATO membership, so that when the time is right, Ukraine can become a NATO member straightaway.”

Still, there is a general recognition that NATO’s position out of the summit needs to have advanced from last year’s meeting in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, when the allies declared that “Ukraine’s future is in NATO” but didn’t offer a timeline. Members of the alliance announced at the time that they would remove the requirement for a Membership Action Plan for Ukraine, making it easier for the country to join the alliance, but still declined to offer a timeline on how long that might take.

That was met with fury by Zelensky who posted on X that it was “unprecedented and absurd” not to have been offered a timeline for membership.

Vague commitment in 2008

It was back in 2008 at a NATO summit in Budapest that Ukraine was first offered a vague commitment of an invitation to join in the future. Ukrainians often invoke the lack of clarity dating back 16 years as an argument for deserving more, particularly when under attack by Russia.

“I’m certain that we will also have language expressing that Ukraine will become a member of the alliance,” Stoltenberg said Tuesday at a news conference at the US State Department. “The exact language, exactly what we will agree … are now discussed among allies. But I’m confident we have a good solution, agreement by the summit.”

The Biden administration has trumpeted its newly signed ten-year defense pact with Ukraine, which calls itself “a bridge to Ukraine’s eventual membership in the NATO Alliance.”

But for many Europeans that doesn’t go far enough.

“Of course we’d be for ‘irreversible,’” a third Eastern European official said.

It’s “not a big secret we are eager to get more” than the US, the official added, adding they hope the US administration can remain “flexible” ahead of the formal meetings next month.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week that peace talks would only begin with Ukraine if Kyiv officially gives up on its NATO aspirations.

“As soon as Kyiv declares that it is ready for such a decision,” Putin said on Friday, “an order to cease fire and begin negotiations will immediately follow from our side, literally at the same minute.”

A key component of NATO membership is a mutual defense pact known as Article V that commits NATO allies to defend any member that is attacked. Ukraine has been intensifying its push to join NATO since it was first attacked by Russia in 2014.

Since the war in Ukraine began in 2022, Ukrainian and European officials have accused the US of being too afraid of provoking Putin and escalating the conflict. Ukraine has both been grateful and frustrated as it watched the US offer bigger and bigger weapons packages, but at a slower pace than it has needed.

Last month Stoltenberg indirectly criticized the Biden administration for not allowing Ukraine to use US weapons to fire into Russia, which Ukrainians have said amounts to them fighting with one hand tied behind their back.

“This is a war of aggression by Russia against Ukraine,” Stoltenberg told The Economist. “Ukraine has the right to defend themselves. And that includes striking targets on Russian territory.”

On May 30 the Biden administration announced that Ukraine could fire into Russia but only in a limited way: at military targets across the border from the city of Kharkiv and not with the most formidable US weapons, the long-range ATACMS missile.

London has often been much more forward-leaning than Washington on weaponry for Ukraine and how it’s used. Generally, throughout the conflict, British officials, the closest US allies in NATO, have consistently hoped the White House would take a more aggressive stance.

Officials who CNN spoke with emphasized that when it comes to the NATO communique that no decisions have been made yet and the language is still actively under discussion ahead of the summit.

“When the text is on the table and the countries start to negotiate we can see the full picture,” the Eastern European official said. “We are ready to negotiate; of course we would like to have it be as ambitious as possible.”

80814c0855,Financial Times,Kamala Harris seeks centre-left sweet spot in US election battle - Financial Times,"Kamala Harris is seeking to appeal to moderate voters without alienating the left of her Democratic party as the vice-president tries to find a winning political formula to defeat Donald Trump in the November election.

In her first major decision as presidential nominee, Harris this week chose Minnesota governor Tim Walz as her running mate, presenting the former congressman, who is also a retired Army National Guardsman and geography teacher, as a safe pick who could appeal to rural voters.

But Walz has also championed free school meals for children, and policies to support labour unions, paid family and medical leave, health insurance and driver’s licences for migrants who illegally entered the country. Many Democrat progressives approved of the choice.

The selection of Walz is part of Harris’s effort to find the political sweet spot on the centre left that will maximise her chances of beating Trump in a close election likely to be decided in just a few battleground states.

Since entering the race on July 21, Harris has already galvanised large parts of the Democratic base — including young voters, women and people of colour — that were uninspired by President Joe Biden’s re-election bid.

But she knows this cannot happen at the expense of appealing to a broader audience. “When elected, we will govern on behalf of all Americans,” she said at a rally with Walz in Philadelphia on Tuesday.

Harris and her campaign have also tried to show they have dropped some of the more staunchly leftwing positions she had embraced during her failed bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, when she proposed a progressive wishlist, including a single-payer healthcare programme, a “Green New Deal” and the decriminalisation of illegal entry to the US.

“[2020] was a wildly contested primary, which sadly in the Democratic party tends to lead you to more left of centre positions,” said former US trade representative Ron Kirk, who has known Harris for more than two decades.

“But I think there is nothing like being next to the seat of power and being in the White House and understanding just how brutally difficult these decisions are that the president has to make.”

Harris now calls for more police funding, expanding access to health insurance through the Affordable Care Act and boosting the number of Border Patrol agents.

The shift has been noted by supporters such as investor Bob Pohlad, a megadonor who serves on the boards of PepsiCo and the Minnesota Twins baseball team.

After a Zoom call with donors, he described Harris as “so effective, and so, frankly and honestly, different than I had seen her in the short campaign in 2020 . . . and had seen her since then”.

“She made me feel confident,” he added. “She made me feel enthusiastic.”

Unlike in 2020, Harris has also embraced her past as San Francisco’s district attorney and California’s attorney-general to show her toughness on criminals.

This year, Trump became the first former president to be convicted of a crime after the hush money trial and separately faces massive civil fraud penalties in New York. Harris has pitched the 2024 election as a choice between a prosecutor and a felon.

California lieutenant-governor Eleni Kounalakis said Harris can “really restore a sense of order” in the country compared with “much more chaos with Donald Trump”.

“She is the person who can hold Trump accountable,” she added.

Still, Harris has not insulated herself from political attacks from Republicans, who have been quick to depict Walz as a radical leftist.

Republicans have shared a video of him saying “One person’s socialism is another person’s neighbourliness” and criticised his handling of the 2020 summer riots after a white policeman in Minneapolis murdered George Floyd.

In YouTube videos and Truth Social posts, Trump’s campaign has also blasted Harris for the rise in illegal immigration and over the “defund the police” slogan, which she has discarded.

“Tim Walz let Minnesota burn,” said Trump in a post on Truth Social on Wednesday. “Kamala Harris bailed out the ones who lit the matches.”

But Trump has struggled to make overtures to the political middle: JD Vance, the Ohio senator he picked as his running mate, is widely seen as a darling of the conservative right but is finding it difficult to appeal to swing voters.

The former president has also continued to make inflammatory public remarks and social media posts that will raise the eyebrows of moderate voters. At the National Association of Black Journalists convention last week, he questioned Harris’s racial identity.

“I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black. So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?” he said, to widespread condemnation.

Harris’s challenge will be to exploit the vacuum at the ideological centre of US politics without favouring one faction of her party over the other — a balance that so far has benefited her.

In the first 24 hours after Walz was announced as Harris’s running mate, their campaign reported raising $36mn.

“I am so excited, I’ll tell ya,” said Mark Buell, a California real estate developer, who has backed Harris in every local, state and federal race since meeting her over hamburgers at San Francisco’s Balboa Cafe about 22 years ago.

71b40f45fa,POLITICO,Here's Tuesday night’s lineup of RNC speakers - POLITICO,"Jul 2024

A parade of Trump's former GOP rivals bend the knee

The former president received adulations from those who once tried to take him out.

It wasn’t the speech they wanted to give at the RNC. But it was the speech they were allowed to give.

More than a dozen Republicans challenged former President Donald Trump for the Republican nomination last year — but he took them out, one by one. And nearly all of them took the stage at the RNC to offer olive branches to the former president.

“Former President Trump asked me to speak at this convention in the name of unity,” former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley said in her speech at the Republican National Convention Tuesday night. “It was a gracious invitation and I was happy to accept. I'll start by making one thing perfectly clear: Donald Trump has my strong endorsement.”

Haley wasn't always so magnanimous. She stopped short of an endorsement in March, when the former South Carolina governor suspended her campaign.

She also wasn’t the only former rival for the Republican nomination to speak at the RNC. On Tuesday night, several former presidential candidates — including businessmen Vivek Ramaswamy and Perry Johnson — pledged fealty to the man they once tried to defeat. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who suffered months of Trump's humiliating attacks, put a smile on his face as he backed the former president.

“Let's make the 45th president of the United States the 47th president of the United States,” DeSantis said. “Let's elect Republicans up and down the ballot and let's heed the call of our party's nominee to fight, fight, fight for these United States.”

Other Trump rivals-turned-surrogates scored speaking slots: Sen. Tim Scott spoke Monday night and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum is slated for later this week. Both came under consideration for the vice presidential spot.

The former presidential candidates emphasized their agreements with Trump and attacked Biden, all while the former president looked down from the stands. They spoke in the name of unity of the Republican party, warning Trump’s critics that a second Biden term would be disastrous.

Trump's path to beloved Republican Party standard-bearer has been a rocky one, filled with primary challengers, criminal indictments (and a conviction) and an assassination attempt. But he ultimately won over his former antagonists, even if there was one noticeable exception at the RNC: Chris Christie.

The former New Jersey governor was one of his harshest Republican critics, and instead of speaking on stage, he wrote an op-ed in the New York Times that almost seemed optimistic. Trump “has the opportunity to rein in some of the worst rhetorical impulses of the Republican Party” at the convention, he wrote. ""This can be a moment to choose the country we want to be.""

And three of Trump's foes from the famously nasty 2016 GOP primary also made appearances Tuesday night: Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Dr. Ben Carson.

It's a sign of just how far Trump has come. Cruz, who once urged RNC attendees to ""vote your conscience"" at the convention, spoke with a warm tone about the former president and offered his full-throated endorsement.

Haley, who amassed the second-most GOP delegates in the primary, released them to Trump earlier this month. It was a sign that whatever case she once made against him is in the rearview mirror.

“You don’t have to agree with Trump 100 percent of the time to vote for him,” Haley said. “Take it from me. I haven’t always agreed with President Trump. But we agree more often than we disagree.”

CORRECTION: This post initially miscounted the number of Donald Trump's 2016 rivals who spoke. There were three.

Lara Trump drew chants and cheers from the crowd throughout her speech.

But one moment in particular stood out: When she mentioned the assassination attempt on the former president, Donald Trump’s daughter-in-law raised her fist — as he had on Saturday from within the tangle of Secret Service agents.

The crowd immediately began shouting, “Fight!”

Marco Rubio takes the stage to sing Trump's and Vance's praises

He focused his speech on American greatness.

Running mate shortlister Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) was the last elected official to speak on Tuesday night. And he focused his speech on American greatness and Donald Trump’s leadership.

“By giving voice to every day Americans,” he said, “President Trump has not just changed our party — he has inspired a movement.”

He praised Trump for expanding the GOP's base, pointing to how voters wait in long lines to attend his rallies. “There is absolutely nothing dangerous or divisive about putting Americans first,"" Rubio said.

Unlike his speech in Doral last week, the Florida senator did not use any Spanish, nor did he deride liberals or the Biden-Harris ticket.

Rubio also praised the Republican vice presidential nominee who beat him to the job, J.D. Vance, as an example of what Americans can achieve.

“As the life story of our next vice president J.D. Vance reminds us, we are all descendants of ordinary people who achieved extraordinary things,” he said.

We should note: The state of Florida had two senators and a governor speak tonight.

Jul 2024 | From the RNC

On the first night of the RNC, Rep. John James (R-Mich.) proclaimed, ""If you don't vote for Donald Trump, you ain't Black"" — a clear reference to President Joe Biden's controversial comment from 2020, ""If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t Black.""

Fast forward four years, former President Trump's campaign is trying to cut into Biden’s support among people of color. We asked Black delegates at the RNC what they thought of Monday night's moment and why they support Trump.

She used to speak for Trump. Now she's talking about herself.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders touted her record as governor — and addressed old grievances.

Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders took the stage — and the spotlight — tonight.

After briefly praising former President Donald Trump (“Not even an assassin's bullet could stop him,” she told the crowd) Huckabee Sanders trained the conversation on herself.

In one notable anecdote, Trump’s former White House press secretary recalled an incident where her son, Huck, dodged a hug from the then-President and ran into her arms instead.

“For my 4-year-old son, the most powerful man in the world had nothing on his mom,” she said.

Huckabee Sanders also used her prime time speaking slot to rehash old grievances, railing against “the left” for what she described as “relentless attacks” — from insults at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner, to getting booted from a restaurant, to criticism from cable news hosts.

Later on, she touted her record as governor. “I'm proud to be the first and only governor in the country to kick communist China off our farmland and out of my state,” she said.

The speech did circle back to Trump, who Huckabee Sanders depicted as saved by God.

“God spared President Trump because God is not finished with him yet.”

It's not just immigration: Speakers hit on crime, defunding the police

“Never forget: The Democratic Party is the party of defunding the police,” the Iowa attorney general said to cheers.

Much of the night dubbed “Make America Safe Once Again” has focused heavily on the issue of immigration, with one speaker after another attacking President Joe Biden over “open borders,” highlighting so-called sanctuary cities and calling attention to tragic cases of women killed by undocumented immigrants.

But some speakers also hit more broadly on themes of urban disorder and crime — with several lines that felt like a throwback to the 2020 election cycle. Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird was the first to bring up a topic that was much more frequent four years ago: defunding the police — a call from some Democratic activists in the summer of 2020 that neither Biden nor Vice President Kamala Harris ever backed, but that has stuck around as a frequent line of Republican attack against them and other Democratic candidates.

“Never forget: the Democratic Party is the party of defunding the police,” Bird said to cheers. “They said it, they mean it and they can’t wiggle out of it.”

Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) echoed that argument, saying the “rule of law” had “disintegrated"" under Biden and accusing the president of standing by while “liberal DAs and mayors pushed a ‘defund-the-police’ agenda.”

“The weakness and the wokeness of the Biden-Harris administration has made us less safe,” Schmitt said.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, in a wide-ranging stump speech, similarly argued that “progressive prosecutors” have been “coddling criminals.”

Several of the “ordinary Americans” selected to speak at the convention on Tuesday similarly sought to tie Democratic policies to urban crime and disorder. Erin Koper, a conservative activist from Pittsburgh, spoke about seeing “tent cities” on her own street and feeling unsafe as a woman alone on the street — punctuating her argument with a reference to a place that is a frequent Republican boogeyman.

“What Democrats did to San Francisco, they’re doing to my city,” she said. “But law-abiding citizens are fighting back.”

House Republicans spell out their dream for 2025: A larger majority and Trump 2.0

“Standing arm in arm, we will make America safe again,” Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said.

On Tuesday night, House Republicans painted their ideal vision for 2025 — one where they’d have a larger House majority and work hand in hand with a second Trump administration.

They currently do have a majority, but it’s not by much. The small margin has largely led to chaos and infighting within the GOP over its priorities, all before they’re stymied by a Democrat-led Senate and President Joe Biden.

So House Republicans, while being uplifting in their predictions for November, also leaned into a harsh reality: that their aspirations must come true. In order to get things done next term, they said, they need a Trump administration and possibly a Republican-led Senate in place.

“The GOP will grow our House majority, we will take back the Senate and we will return Donald J. Trump to the White House,” Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said. “Standing arm in arm, we will make America safe again.”

House Majority Whip Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) in his speech said he and his fellow lawmakers have “held the line” despite having “one of the smallest majorities in history.”

“When we grow our majority, when we flip the Senate, when we send President Donald J. Trump back to the White House, we won't just be holding the line anymore,” Emmer said. “We will be moving forward.”

Still, the GOP members didn’t forget to highlight the small dunks they’ve had over Democrats in the past two years.

The theme of the second night of the convention was safety. Several lawmakers leaned into rhetoric that evoked fear around how a second Biden term would handle issues of border security and crime.

Emmer credited House Republicans for passing “the strongest border security bill in decades” (without mentioning that the bill has been in Senate limbo ever since).

Republican Conference Chair Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) lamented the migrant crisis in New York, casting the blame on Democrats and the Biden administration. She later took the opportunity to remind Americans of another win — her viral questioning of college presidents on antisemitism.

The House speakers tonight largely took on a welcoming tone. Their path to success in November runs right through several, more moderate swing districts that may have even voted against Trump in 2020.

Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-N.J.), one of the lesser known Republican congressmen on the national stage, spoke directly to on-the-fence voters. The Democrat-turned Republican from southern New Jersey talked about a personal conversation he had a few years ago with Trump, who eventually encouraged him to switch parties.

“To the independents and especially to the forgotten Democrats out there, for a moment, I want to speak to you,” Van Drew said. “I know how you feel tonight. Because that's how I felt back in 2019. You feel like your party has left you behind, because it has.”

Even Johnson leaned into that plea, asking other Americans to join their cause.

“We invite all Americans who believe in the promise of our great nation to join us in this fateful battle,” Johnson said Tuesday night. “We can and we will reverse this current decline. We can restore our founding principles. We can preserve this exceptional nation that God has entrusted to us.”

Nikki Haley tried to bring unity to the RNC. Some people booed.

She got a mixed reception.

Nikki Haley was invited to speak in a show of party unity — and she tried to do her part.

""We have a country to save, and a unified Republican Party is essential to saving her,"" she said. Donald Trump could be seen applauding, though she got some light boos from the crowd throughout her speech.

But a line in her speech tonight suggests she doesn't feel like Trump and his supporters have done enough to reach beyond his base.

""We must not only be a unified party, we must also expand our party,"" she said. ""We are so much better when we are bigger. We are stronger when we welcome people into our party, when we have different backgrounds and experiences.""

But she herself got a mixed reception.

On the one hand, Charlie Kirk gave her a thumbs up: “I thought it was the right tone, it was the right speech.”

But Kelley Koch, chair of the Republican Party of Dallas County, Iowa, rolled her eyes when asked what she thought of Haley's speech. She “needed to for her career,” said Koch, who saw Haley and all the other Republicans come through trying to win votes in January's caucuses.

That said, she said she didn’t appreciate the booing that came from some in the crowd when Haley took the stage. “We need unity.”

Jul 2024 | From Milwaukee

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis came out to resounding applause for a prime-time speech in Milwaukee, saying it was “Time to send Donald Trump back to the White House” and that “America cannot afford four more years of a 'Weekend at Bernie’s' presidency.”

DeSantis spoke as his former bitter rival looked on from his private box. At one point, Trump could be seen smiling when DeSantis reminded the crowd that he’d sent migrants from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard to make a political point about illegal immigration. At least once during DeSantis' remarks he turned to speak to J.D. Vance.

But he still allowed himself a victory lap for his accomplishments in Florida, a onetime swing state.

“Due to bold leadership, the Democratic Party lies in ruins,” he said, before adding that Trump gave them the chance to do the same across the U.S. Trump stood and clapped as DeSantis finished his remarks.

Nikki Haley uses an old line of attack on Kamala Harris in a new way

Trump's former rival for the GOP nomination attacks Biden's VP. But it comes in a fresh context.

Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley made a large component of her candidacy about age — namely that both octogenarian President Joe Biden and septuagenarian former President Donald Trump are too old to lead.

One of the cornerstones of her stump speeches: mental competency tests. She’s also made no secret of her disdain for the much younger Democratic vice president.

Now those criticisms are coming with fresh context.

""For more than a year I've said a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for President Kamala Harris. After seeing the debate, everyone knows it's true. If we have four more years of Biden or a single day of Harris, our country will be badly worse off,"" Haley said on Tuesday in her convention speech. ""For the sake of our nation, we have to go with Donald Trump.""

Unlike when Haley was running for president, Biden's age is now fully in the spotlight. He's facing growing calls from his party to step aside and let someone — perhaps Harris — take his place at the top of the ticket. And Haley's calls for mental competency tests are suddenly gaining new steam. Trump even offered to ""go with"" Biden to take one.

""And let me remind you. Kamala had one job. One job. And that was to fix the border. Now imagine her in charge of the entire country,"" Haley said, before a meaningful pause.

Nikki Haley’s pitch to voters still skeptical of Donald Trump: “You don’t have to agree with Trump 100 percent of the time to vote for him. Take it from me. I haven’t always agreed with President Trump. But we agree more often than we disagree.”

Trump, who is watching from a box with some of his children and other prominent supporters, gave a short laugh.

Haley was Trump's ambassador to the U.N. and later ran against him in the Republican presidential primary. Her speech was greeted with cheers — and light boos.

After initially being left off the convention lineup, Nikki Haley, the last of Donald Trump's primary rivals, came on stage in Milwaukee and thanked him for his ""gracious"" last-minute invitation to speak. As he looked on, she pledged him her ""strong endorsement.""

Elise Stefanik isn't salty about the VP pick

She made a fervent pitch on behalf of Donald Trump to the GOP base in her convention speech.

New York Rep. Elise Stefanik was among the vice presidential runners up who lost to Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance. But that hasn’t dimmed her support of former President Donald Trump — and she got to sit with him in the VIP box Tuesday night.

Stefanik said she spoke with Trump on Sunday, a day after the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania: “God was looking down on him,” she told POLITICO in an interview after her convention speech. “He’s just excited about this unifying moment.""

She also expects Vance’s selection will help expand the electoral map in the upper Midwest.

“It was a great choice by President Trump,"" she said. ""He brings a real political talent to win in key states like Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania.”

Being in the vice presidential mix was “an honor, a humbling honor,” she added.

The lawmaker used her speech at the convention to address the GOP base, making a fervent pitch for Trump and blasting President Joe Biden’s administration over crime, the border and inflation. “Our constitution and the soul of the very nation are on the ballot,” she said.

It's been an eventful year for Stefanik as she marks a decade since her election to the House. And she's on the front lines for this cycle in New York, spearheading efforts to retain five first-term lawmakers first elected to swing seats two years ago: Reps. Mike Lawler, Marc Molinaro, Brandon Williams, Anthony D'Esposito and Nick LaLota.

Those races are expected to be pivotal for Republicans if they wish to keep their narrow majority in the House.

Democrats are well aware of the stakes, too. Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and party officials in New York have poured time and resources into key House races in a bid to make the Brooklyn Democrat the new speaker. House Democratic candidates in New York also reported a successful fundraising quarter, besting their GOP opponents.

But Republicans are eyeing polling and issues they believe play in their favor, including the very concerns Stefanik pressed on in her convention speech: crime and the flow of migrants into places like New York City.

A Siena College poll in June found Trump trailing Biden by just 8 points in New York, where Democrats outnumber Republicans two to one.

“We are on pace to potentially pick up seats, which I think we will in New York,” Stefanik said in the interview. “But [Trump's] pulling within single digits in New York.”

Donald Trump walked out into the arena to cheers from the crowd for night two of the RNC. He joined allies and family, including his new running mate Sen. J.D. Vance, Gov.

Trump still wore a bandage on his right ear, but he seemed more joyful tonight than on Monday, when he seemed emotional about the reception he received after surviving an assassination attempt.

GOP speakers are going after Kamala Harris

Republicans running for Congress are hoping to tie the vice president to downballot Democrats.

Speakers so far tonight, many of whom are focused on helping Republicans keep the House and flip the Senate, have taken plenty of shots at President Joe Biden.

But several have also gone after Vice President Kamala Harris amid continuing conversations from some corners of the Democratic Party that she could still replace him at the top of the ticket.

The efforts to tie downballot Democrats, who have polled significantly ahead of Biden in some states, to the presidential ticket, fit familiar patterns.

Dave McCormick, who is challenging Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, slammed what he called the “Biden-Harris-Casey” border policy. He and several other speakers slammed Harris as the “border czar” — seemingly referencing how Biden made her the point person on immigration early in his administration.

Michigan Senate candidate Mike Rogers said he had “never seen anything like the Biden-Harris open border policy.” And House Majority Leader Steve Scalise accused Biden and Harris of wanting to allow “illegals” to vote.

But the attacks on Harris weren’t just about the border. Nevada Senate candidate Sam Brown said the “Biden-Harris economy” was “terrible for Nevadans.” New Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a former Democrat, asserted that Harris and Biden are “hurting our country.”

House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota said his state could not “afford four more years of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.” He later accused the pair of “destroying jobs,” and went on a riff accusing Harris of enabling criminals and rioters amid protests and unrest in 2020 — ultimately spending a greater share of his speech attacking her than he spent on Biden.

Jul 2024

House Speaker Mike Johnson said America is currently in a battle over “two completely different visions” — but invited everyone watching tonight's convention programming to join the Republican cause.

“We invite all Americans who believe in the promise of our great nation to join us in this fateful battle,” Johnson said Tuesday night. “We can and we will reverse this current decline. We can restore our founding principles. We can preserve this exceptional nation that God has entrusted to us.”

Johnson also leaned heavily into his law and Christian backgrounds. He said Republicans are the party of “law and order” and referred to America as ""this exceptional nation that God has entrusted to us.""

Senate candidates use their prime time speeches to tie their opponents to Biden

Republican candidates in some of the biggest Senate races went after their opponents from the convention stage.

Battleground Senate candidates got prime-time speaking slots at the Republican National Convention tonight, and they took the opportunity to flex a key line of attack: tying their Democratic opponents to President Joe Biden.

GOP candidates running in most of the competitive Senate races took the stage, including Kari Lake of Arizona; Eric Hovde of Wisconsin; Bernie Moreno of Ohio; former Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers; Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania; Sam Brown of Nevada; Tim Sheehy of Montana and Hung Cao of Virginia.

They didn’t hold back on criticizing their Democratic opponents, and the Biden throughline was clear.

Lake referenced the “disastrous Democrat policies pushed by Joe Biden and his favorite congressman, my opponent, Ruben Gallego.” “The policies of Biden and Bob Casey are dangerous for Pennsylvania and America,” McCormick argued. “Jacky [Rosen] and Joe want to raise your taxes while dodging their own,” Brown charged. Hovde and Sheehy called their Democratic opponents, Sens. Tammy Baldwin and Jon Tester, respectively, a “rubber stamp” for the president.

“Sherrod Brown votes with Biden virtually 100 percent of the time,” Moreno said. “I don't know if I agree with my wife 100 percent of the time. But Sherrod and Joe seem to have a very close relationship.”

But that theme wasn’t as prominent in Cao’s speech as he spoke about his campaign against Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine in Virginia, where Biden and Democratic Sen. Mark Warner both won by double-digits in 2020. Although the state hasn’t been a slam dunk for Republicans, the decision to have Cao in the speaker lineup further underscores how Republicans view their expanding battleground map.

Republican candidates have repeatedly sought to tie Democrats to Biden throughout the cycle — and will likely continue to do, given his unpopularity in polls.

Meanwhile, vulnerable Democrats have at times sought to distance themselves from the president, emphasizing their bipartisanship and pointing out times they’ve disagreed with the Biden administration.

And Democrats are sure to use their opponents’ appearances at the RNC to fuel their own attacks.

“Republicans’ roster of flawed Senate recruits offers something to repel every kind of voter,” Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesperson David Bergstein said in a statement before the night’s speeches. “Nothing these candidates say on stage will change the fact that their ever-growing list of scandals, baggage and vulnerabilities make them unelectable in their states.”

Republicans use Tuesday's prime-time programming to hammer immigration

And the Biden campaign subtly pushes back.

Tonight’s GOP immigration messaging strategy? Paint the darkest picture possible of a country in decline.

Florida Sen. Rick Scott said he has a “nightmare” that in a second Biden administration, the southern border will be “erased” and that President Joe Biden will fly so many “illegals into our country that the cartel started getting frequent flier miles.” Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake said Arizona’s border has been handed over to cartels and criminals, and that deadly drugs are “pouring in” and killing children. Wisconsin Senate candidate Eric Hovde said Biden has allowed “criminals and terrorists to enter our country.”

The speakers are pulling a page directly from former President Donald Trump’s playbook, tying immigration to crime and arguing that Biden’s policies have created an unsafe America. It’s a message that frequently dominates Trump’s campaign rallies and one that’s expected to be a key part of the GOP nominee’s speech on Thursday.

“Illegal immigrants have victimized innocent young women who could easily be your daughter or mine,” said Pennsylvania Senate candidate Dave McCormick.

The speakers repeatedly hit Biden for “open border” policies and slammed Vice President Kamala Harris as his “border czar,” a reference to the job Biden tapped her for back in 2021, when he asked Harris to help stem immigration by addressing the root causes of migration.

Their message will be bolstered with speeches from what the RNC has designated ""everyday Americans"" who fit the theme, including the family of Rachel Morin, who was raped and killed in 2023. A man who entered the country illegally from El Salvador was arrested for her murder in June.

Democrats, for their part, were busy with their own counterprogramming. Biden is in Nevada, where he’ll speak to the UnidosUS Annual Conference on Wednesday, part of his effort to shore up Latino voters — a bloc the Biden campaign believes he can retain in part by emphasizing Trump’s second-term immigration plans. The Democratic National Committee also blasted out a release before tonight’s events kicked off, highlighting the speakers' opposition to a bipartisan border bill that Trump urged Republicans in Congress to kill earlier this year.

The White House also announced — just before RNC programming kicked off at 6 p.m. — that since Biden restricted asylum claims at the southern border, crossings have dropped by more than 50 percent. The Department of Homeland Security has decreased the number of people released pending their removal proceedings — so-called catch and release — by 70 percent, a White House official said. DHS has also removed more than 50,000 people to more than 100 countries, operating more than 175 international repatriation flights since the policy began in June.

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise spoke to Saturday's assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump by referencing his own near-death experience.

“Many of you know I was the survivor of a politically motivated shooting in 2017. Not many know that while I was fighting for my life, Donald Trump was one of the first to come console my family at the hospital,” Scalise said during his speech. “That's the kind of leader he is: courageous under fire, compassionate towards others. Let's put Donald Trump back in the White House this November so we can make America great again.”

Scalise was shot in the hip and nearly bled to death when a gunman opened fire during a practice for the annual Congressional Baseball Game in Alexandria, Virginia. He underwent several surgeries and faced a lengthy recovery before returning to Congress.

J.D. Vance's story 'works on Long Island,' New York Republicans say

""We really need that new energetic voice in politics,” Broome County GOP Chair Benji Feldman said.

New York Republicans say vice presidential pick J.D. Vance will help them return their swing seat members to Congress.

""We really need that new energetic voice in politics,” Broome County GOP Chair Benji Federman told POLITICO from the convention floor.

“We need to energize the base for Marc Molinaro,” he added, referring the representative from New York's 19th District, who is running for re-election in a seat that President Joe Biden won in 2020.

Both parties have declared that the road to a majority runs through the Empire State. New York state party chair Ed Cox reaffirmed that’s still the case in Milwaukee.

“It’s going to be very positive,” Cox said of Vance’s addition. “J.D. Vance can cover Trump's base, and permit Trump to do the things that he knows he needs to do.”

Federman said Vance, who is 39, could help drive up voter turnout in his county — in both parties — and his relative youth in the presidential race will inspire a new generation of Republicans in New York.

“J.D. Vance, his biography, his history, the way he grew up … It's a story of raising yourself from your bootstraps,” said Suffolk County GOP Chair Jesse Garcia, who’s county covers two Long Island districts. “That's a story that works on Long Island. It's a story that works in upstate New York and even works in New York City. And I think that's going to make a connection with our voters.”

Chris Christie isn't taking the stage — but he's making his voice heard anyway

The former New Jersey governor, one of Donald Trump’s most prominent critics, dropped a New York Times op-ed today.

Not all of Donald Trump’s former rivals for the GOP nomination are poised to take the stage in Milwaukee tonight. The most notable name left off the lineup: Chris Christie.

But the former New Jersey governor, one of Trump’s most prominent critics, is making his voice heard in other ways — like by dropping a New York Times op-ed today titled, “Will Trump Rise to Meet the Moment?”

Christie, who ran against Trump in both 2016 and 2024, writes that the former president “has the opportunity to rein in some of the worst rhetorical impulses of the Republican Party” this week.

But he says Trump isn’t off to a promising start by picking Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance as his running mate — a selection that he (and other more moderate Republicans and non-Trumpers) argue only plays to a MAGA base that’s already squarely in his corner.

Still, Christie said things could change if Trump follows through with delivering a revamped speech on Thursday that calls for unity rather than attacking the Biden administration as reportedly initially planned — and then stays that course.

Kevin McCarthy's beefing with Matt Gaetz again

We followed up with both of them after McCarthy slammed Gaetz in a live interview with CNN earlier this evening.

Well, folks, here's some McCarthy-Gaetz drama for you.

Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy slammed Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida in a live interview with CNN earlier this evening, saying, ""He's got an ethics complaint about paying, sleeping with a 17-year-old."" (McCarthy was referencing the Justice Department's previous investigation into Gaetz for sex trafficking and allegations that he had sexual relations with an underage girl. The investigation was dropped in February 2023.)

Gaetz, who stood close to the microphone next to McCarthy, retorted in the background: “If you took that stage, you would get booed off of it. You would get booed off the stage.”

We followed up with McCarthy, who said he didn’t know who was taunting him and instead thought it was someone “asking for a selfie.”

After learning it was Gaetz, McCarthy said that “the poor guy was losing his mind.”

“That’s the fear of going to jail, I think,” McCarthy told us.

Of course, we then had to follow up with Gaetz, who said he interrupted McCarthy because the former speaker was ""saying some very naughty and untrue things about me.""

“I thought, well, he's live on television. This is a convention after all, why not convene a little,” Gaetz told us.

Babydog steals the show

The bulldog got a prime seat next to the speaker's podium.

West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice had the speaking slot, but Babydog stole the show.

In the middle of the convention's Senate candidate power hour, the governor brought his famed bulldog on stage and gave her a prime seat right next to the speaker’s podium. And according to Justice, she's also yapped to him about her very own breed of conservatism:

“Babydog has got a prediction for everybody here. And here is the prediction: Babydog says that we will retain the House, the majority in the House, we are going to flip the United States Senate and overwhelmingly we are going to elect Donald J. Trump and J.D. Vance in November,” Justice said.

As for his fight against Sen.

The controversial pastor once slept outside for 343 nights.

Rev. Corey Brooks, a Chicago pastor and a Republican who speaks out on about crime and violence, will give the closing prayer on the second day of the RNC.

Brooks made headlines for twice spending extensive time living outdoors on a rooftop, including during the brutal Chicago winter, to call attention to violence in his South Side neighborhood.

In the second stint, Brooks spent 343 nights on the roof of the motel across the street from his church. Brooks wrote an op-ed on Fox News published today that he has felt “immense pressure” to renounce his support of the Republican Party from Democrats in his life.

Thune 'pretty confident' GOP wins Senate majority

But the would-be majority leader is worried about Republican candidates' cash deficit.

Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) is the latest Republican to predict a GOP Senate majority next year, but also expressed some concern about the party's fundraising deficit heading into the final months of the campaign.

“I am pretty confident we get the majority,” the Republican whip said Tuesday in a CNN-POLITICO Grill interview, remarking that there are “a number of the seats that could break for us” on the map.

Thune, who is formally seeking to replace Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) as the top Senate Republican, cited a series of factors they hope will flip one to two seats, depending on who wins the presidential election.

“First of all, we got a great map, but then we have really, really strong candidates in all the key states and [former President Donald Trump] is performing well in a lot of states,” Thune added.

Still, he noted that Republican candidates are struggling to keep pace with their Democratic opponents in fundraising — many of whom are longtime incumbents like Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Jon Tester (D-Mont.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.).

“There is a significant ... financial disadvantage a lot of our candidates have relative to their democratic opponents in hard dollars,” Thune said. “But you don't have to have as much money as you have aside, but you gotta have enough money to get your message out. So I think right now it's raising the resources so that candidates can deliver their message and then just executing on the campaign trail.”

Still, he said he’s optimistic.

“I think it is a favorable environment,” Thune said, before concluding: “I feel like we're in the best position we can be.”

What Mike Pence's former chief of staff thinks about about the J.D. Vance pick

“I think that it's not really a politically additive selection.""

Mike Pence’s right hand man in the White House isn’t all too impressed with Donald Trump’s new running mate.

Marc Short, who served as chief of staff to Vice President Pence in the Trump administration, said he doesn’t believe J.D. Vance would be able to attract new voters that the presidential nominee himself isn’t already reeling in.

“I think that it's not really a politically additive selection. But I think that Vance is incredibly articulate in defending Trump's policies, and he wanted to have a surrogate. That's what Vance provides,” Short told POLITICO in an interview Tuesday outside the RNC convention center.

Asked if he expects Vance to mold himself to Trump’s positions — as Pence once also did — Short replied: “I think you've seen Vance go from a Hillary Clinton voter in 2016 to Trump’s vice presidential pick, so he probably has flexibility in his positions.” (While Vance previously said he considered supporting Clinton in 2016, he ultimately backed independent candidate Evan McMullin, according to reports.)

Vance has already moderated his positions on abortion to mirror those of Trump.

It is no secret that Trump and Pence — plus his allies — departed the White House on bad terms over Jan. 6, after Pence refused to bend to Trump’s demands when it came to objecting to the certification of Joe Biden’s victory. A mob of Trump supporters violently stormed the Capitol that day, with some chanting “Hang Mike Pence!” in its hallways.

While Vance, an Ohio senator and author of ‘Hillbilly Elegy,’ was widely praised as Trump’s pick after he announced the decision Monday, there were earlier voices expressing similar concerns as congressional lawmakers deliberated who they would like to see as Trump’s No. 2.

Republicans who favor Vance — which include many in conservative groups like the House Freedom Caucus — argue that while he is politically similar to Trump, he had a far different life story. And they believe he will be able to draw in voters who resonate with his ability to speak to the rural, blue-collar workers as well as those who aspire to have an American dream ascent like his.

Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.), chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he endorsed Vance in his Senate primary because “J.D. and I are so similar.”

“I was very excited because Appalachia is similar to the Ozarks. I grew up in a trailer most of my life,"" Smith said. “He will absolutely be able to speak to people in Appalachia, in the Rust Belt, in areas that are referred to as flyover country because they feel forgotten. In his book, he wrote about it pretty clearly, about the Forgotten person and the battle against the elites.”

Rep. Dan Meuser wants speakers to cool down the rhetoric

Asked if some of the RNC speakers had already gone too far in attacking Democrats, the lawmaker replied: “Absolutely.”

Rep. Dan Meuser (R-Pa.) wants speakers at the Republican National Convention to “make a conscious effort to cool it down” — the latest in a series of calls from lawmakers to temper political rhetoric following the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump.

Meuser — a state Trump campaign co-chair who had been sitting in the front row of the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally — said Tuesday on CNN that speakers should use the convention “as a unifying moment.”

“I do my very best to not make that part of my vernacular, my vocabulary. I’ll tell you this — sometimes it does, it gets a little hot out there in politics,” he said. “But we need to all make a conscious effort to cool it down, to tone it down, and we need to see examples of it.”

Asked if some of the RNC speakers’ rhetoric had already gone too far — including references to Democrats as “dangerous” and President Joe Biden as “senile” — Meuser replied: “Absolutely.”

“There’s a lot of personal attacks that have taken place, and certainly some from Republicans, I’ll take responsibility,” he said. “But there are also a lot coming from the left.”

Scalise calls on Secret Service director to step down

“I've been very disappointed in her and her lack of candor,” he said in an interview at the CNN-POLITICO Grill in Milwaukee.

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who was injured in a politically motivated shooting in 2017, called on Secret Service Director Kim Cheatle to step down following the agency’s failure to prevent the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump on Saturday.

“I've been very disappointed in her and her lack of candor,” Scalise said in an interview at the CNN-POLITICO Grill in Milwaukee.

Scalise said members of Congress have not yet received answers to “basic questions” about the technology and resources available to agents at Trump's Saturday rally in Pennsylvania. He added that the House Oversight and Homeland Security committees would hold hearings next week related to the incident.

He did have some praise for the FBI, though, for immediately identifying the shooting as an assassination attempt, comparing this to the agency’s decision in 2017 to approach a shooting at a practice for the Congressional Baseball Game as a “suicide by cop.”

“I think the Secret Service head should have been out publicly right away. ... You had the local law enforcement giving a press conference, frankly, being asked questions that the head of service should have been asked,” he said.

Earlier Tuesday, Scalise told Fox News that there needed to be “new leadership at the top of the Secret Service.” In his interview with POLITICO, Scalise also compared his own experience being shot at the Congressional Baseball Game shooting to that of Trump, who was grazed in the ear at his campaign rally.

“Everybody needs to look in the mirror” and dial down their rhetoric, Scalise said — listing mainstream media and late night talk show hosts as examples. The majority leader also dismissed discussion of the need for tougher gun laws.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is cautiously optimistic about Trump's chances in November

He thinks the Trump campaign’s biggest obstacle will be building a ground game.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is cautiously optimistic about a Donald Trump victory in November.

“I absolutely do not think this is a done deal. [But] I feel good unity,” Kemp said of the GOP. “But also four or five months is an eternity in politics.”

The Georgia governor dismissed concerns that Project 2025, a 900-page policy proposal from the Heritage Foundation, would divide the Republican electorate. Its conservative pitches have been a focal point for Democrats' attacks.

Instead he said he believes the Trump campaign’s biggest obstacle will be building a ground game to knock on doors and reach voters.

Kemp's leadership committee, which formed for his reelection campaign in 2022, has lead much of that work in Georgia separate from state party operations. The official Georgia GOP has been occupied by legal challenges that have also sucked up significant funds.

However, the popular swing state governor — and his political resources — is far from Trump’s inner circle. Kemp admitted it’s been a long time since he last spoke to the former president and said that Sen. J. D. Vance was one of the few VP shortlisters whose phone number he didn’t have.

There are numerous third party groups also working on ground game and turn out operations, but Kemp said having an effective team is the difference maker.

“Quite honestly, I think it's one reason that we lost in 2020. And it's one reason that we won in 2022,” Kemp said. “And I think it's a reason that we're going to win in 2024.”

Scalise: Trump shooting brought back 'a lot of emotions'

“I heard the 'pop, pop, pop,'” he said. “It was eerily similar.”

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a survivor of politically motivated gun violence, said the attack on former President Donald Trump brought back memories of his own 2017 shooting.

“A lot of emotions started coming back. I immediately started praying,” he said during an interview at the CNN-POLITICO Grill.

Scalise was shot during a practice for the Congressional Baseball Game, and he nearly lost his life in the attack. The Louisiana Republican recalled that the adrenaline that coursed through him after he was shot shielded him from feeling the severity of the wound.

“I heard the 'pop, pop, pop,'” he said. “It was eerily similar.”

Jordan: I want to speak with law enforcement at Trump rally

The House Judiciary chair warned that his request could be slowed down by the FBI’s own investigation.

House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan said on Tuesday that he wants to speak with law enforcement who were on the scene at Saturday’s shooting at former President Donald Trump’s rally.

""I'd love to talk to the local police officer that supposedly went up and confronted the bad guy,” Jordan said during an interview at the CNN-POLITICO Grill. ""I'd really like to talk to the guy on the roof that took out the bad guy.”

The Ohio Republican indicated that he would try to call them to speak with his committee — though he warned that the request could be slowed down by the FBI’s own investigation. FBI Director Christopher Wray will also appear before Jordan’s committee next week.

Wray’s appearance was already on the books before Saturday’s shooting, but Jordan said that questions about the security at Trump’s rally, including how the gunman was able to get on the roof, were ""the kind of questions"" that Wray will get next week.

Floridians hope for a serious consolation prize for Rubio

After he was passed over as running mate, Sen. Marco Rubio’s (R-Fla.) supporters hope he has a future in Foggy Bottom.

In the end, Florida was the problem for Marco Rubio.

Former President Donald Trump skipped over his fellow Floridian to be his running mate on Monday. That means Rubio is staying in the Senate, at least for now.

Rubio’s Florida residency remained a consistent concern for Trump and his campaign, POLITICO previously reported. Though Trump is far from a stranger to litigation, he and his team were worried about potential legal hurdles that might arise with a Rubio ticket, given the 12th Amendment’s language that says president and vice presidential nominees need to come from different states or otherwise they will lose their shared home state’s electors.

Eric Trump told Florida Republicans gathered for a breakfast Tuesday that Rubio was an “incredible guy” but added that his father felt a special “chemistry” with J.D. Vance, especially given the business background they both share.

It’s a setback for Rubio, who sought the White House himself in 2016 before being crushed by Trump, and also freezes Florida politics — for now. It means Gov. Ron DeSantis won’t get the all-important job of appointing Rubio’s replacement, which would have had cascading implications for several 2026 races.

Trump is also signaling that he sees Vance as the heir to the MAGA movement, complicating possible presidential runs for Rubio or DeSantis in 2028.

But Florida Republicans are hoping for a plumb consolation prize for their state’s senior senator, who is currently serving as vice chair of the Intel Committee and as part of the Foreign Relations Committee.

Several Floridians who spoke to POLITICO floated Rubio as a potential secretary of state pick should Trump win, leaning on his experience in the Senate and the fact that he’s already extensively been vetted multiple times.

Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis called the possibility that Rubio would be considered for secretary of state a “no brainer,” and said that while he would have liked to have seen him make the ticket, he could understand why the campaign wouldn’t want to derail Trump’s recent momentum by facing possible new legal challenges.

Rep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.) said that when he and Rubio campaigned together in 2022, “we had an ability to talk about geopolitical positions, the various nuances, and how domestic and foreign policies are intrinsically linked,"" he said.

When POLITICO caught up with Palm Beach County commissioner Michael Barnett, who was the former GOP chair for the county, he had just heard the running mate news. He too raised the prospect of Rubio joining a future Trump administration as secretary of state, where he could lead on issues from the border to Cuba policy, but added that he could still be valuable to Trump by remaining the senior senator from Florida. Rubio would have even more power if Republicans flip the Senate.

“My understanding is he's always been supportive of President Trump, especially during his four years, on matters involving South America, Central America,” Barnett said.

Former small business administrator suggests she's ‘ready to serve’ again

Linda McMahon wants to get back in the ring for a second Trump administration.

Former Small Business Administration head Linda McMahon suggested she’s “ready to serve” in a second Donald Trump cabinet — and said the business community should be feeling “very good” about J.D. Vance as Trump’s vice presidential pick.

“[Vance] is going to be a good match to work with the president to revitalize the economy,” McMahon, Trump’s SBA chief from 2017 to 2019, said in an interview with POLITICO. “And we certainly want to bring down inflation, we certainly want to bring down prices, we want to do all those things — and I think that J.D. Vance is right on board with being part of that policy.”

McMahon, the one-time WWE CEO who now chairs the pro-Trump think tank America First Policy Institute, was optimistic about the appointments and policies Trump will pursue if he’s elected to a second term in November. But she declined to “get ahead” of the former president on questions of who exactly he’d appoint and whether he’d pursue past ideas like restructuring the Federal Reserve.

“I think that the Trump administration will utilize those people that he's had before,” McMahon said, name-dropping former National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow and former Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett. “Who he'll put in specific areas, I couldn't guess, but he's got a big, big, deep bench to draw on.”

Asked if the Republican Party was shifting to be more pro-union after the Teamsters president spoke at the convention Monday evening, McMahon said she found the Trump administration to “use more common sense” in listening to workers, but didn't explicitly embrace the labor movement. “I just believe there’s a more common sense approach we can take,” she said.

McMahon added that she called Trump after his attempted assassination in a “friend to friend” conversation. She said Trump was very grateful for his survival but likely still processing what had happened.

“It’s a great day to be alive,” Kirk said before going to a commercial break. “J.D. Vance is the vice president … nominee,"" he added, pausing.

Trump campaign says the map has expanded

A senior aide to the former president says the campaign will be competing in traditionally blue states.

Former President Donald Trump's chief pollster is feeling bullish on the battleground map.

Tony Fabrizio, who has worked for Trump through several election cycles, listed out Minnesota, Virginia, New Jersey and New Mexico as toss ups and brushed off claims by Democrats that North Carolina and Arizona were in play for President Joe Biden.

“Those are states that we’re looking at,” he said at the Republican Party of Florida breakfast Tuesday. “And believe it or not, there’s another state up north called Maine,” he added.

One of the biggest factors on how competitive each state will be is who is allowed on the ballot, he explained, referring to independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other third party candidates.

Yes, Republicans have said they were expanding the map before, only for many of those traditionally blue seats to remain in Democrats' column. But this cycle, Fabrizio said it will be different.

He credited Trump’s strength to voter enthusiasm about his candidacy and said he wrote down three words they use to describe Biden to contrast him with Trump: ""Weak, failed, dishonest.""

Fabrizio also boasted that Trump was ahead despite the fact that the campaign hasn’t done much TV ad spending — yet.

“Get ready,” he added, “they’re coming.”

Eric Trump has taken the stage for a surprise appearance at the Florida GOP's breakfast meeting.

He told the crowd “we’re going to win this, plain and simple.” He called running mate shortlister Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) an “incredible guy” to applause from the room, but said they couldn't get around the residency issue.

During his remarks, Eric Trump warned there would be an “October surprise” and told the audience to be on guard for it, saying that the Democrats had “something up their sleeves.” He accused Democrats of trying to “cheat” to win elections, but cited no evidence of fraud.",A man in a suit waves to a crowd with a 'America Gain' banner in the background.,<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BCBF540D0>,2024-07-16 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.politico.com,https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/07/16/rnc-live-updates-coverage/tonights-speakers-00168725,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/71b40f45fa.png
eaa2427f49,Global News,"Canada Day: Celebrations held nationwide, Trudeau hails ‘inclusive’ values - Global News","Thousands converged in the nation’s capital and across the country to celebrate Canada Day, marking 157 years of Confederation.

In his annual message, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, said Canada’s story is one that is “still being written,” speaking of the values of inclusion.

“Together, let’s keep improving this incredible place we all call home. Let’s make our communities more vibrant, dynamic, and inclusive. Let’s break barriers and create opportunity for everyone,” he said.

Trudeau also said Canadians must build a future “where every generation has a fair shot, no matter who you are, where you come from, how you pray, or who you love.”

The national celebration started at noon Eastern Time and includes performances by Bedouin Soundclash and Montreal artist Marie-Mai. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland and Candian Heritage Minister Pascale St-Onge both attended the celebrations.

People in downtown Ottawa watched a special fly-past in honour of the Royal Canadian Air Force’s 100th anniversary featuring the Snowbirds aerobatics team.

The celebrations will be capped off by a fireworks display at around 10 p.m., also at LeBreton Flats.

At Thomson Memorial Park in Toronto, blue skies and sunny weather greeted hundreds of people dressed in red and white and waving small Canadian flags. Families set up picnics and children played on inflatable bouncy castles.

Trudeau did not attend events in Ottawa, but was instead in St. John’s, N.L., where he took part in a ceremony to mark 100 years of the Newfoundland National War Memorial and the interment of the remains of a First World War soldier.

The Unknown Soldier was flown home from France in May and was laid to rest on Monday in a black granite tomb.

Trudeau also attended a Canada Day party at an arena in nearby Mount Pearl. He shook hands, took selfies and hoisted babies for about 20 minutes as kids jumped in bouncy castles and local band KitchenParti played a few traditional Newfoundland folk songs.

In his annual Canada Day message, Trudeau also paid tribute to fallen veterans.

“When Canadian soldiers stormed the beaches of Normandy, they knew they were risking their lives. But freedom – even for those across an ocean, even for generations of people they would never meet – was worth fighting for,” he said.

This year’s anniversary airshow features a series of aircraft that date back to the Second World War along with planes and helicopters the Air Force is flying today.

People also got a glimpse of the RCAF’s future, courtesy of the U.S. Navy, which flew in several of its own aircraft including a P-8 Poseidon surveillance plane. Canada signed a $4.3-billion deal to buy a fleet of P-8s last November and they’re set to arrive in 2026.

The grand finale featured the tremendous roar of a pair of F-35 fighter jets, travelling at more than 350 knots, or around 650 km/h.

What happened at the Harris-Trump debate? Here are the key takeaways

Canada has a $19-billion deal to buy 88 of the jets, but the first of them also won’t arrive until 2026. This pair was flown in by the Vermont Air National Guard.

On Parliament Hill, where the main ceremonies had been held in years before the COVID-19 pandemic, the Air Force pipes and drums band and the air cadets bands will perform throughout the day, and the SkyHawks parachute team is set to drop by at 3 p.m.

Athletes who are representing Team Canada at the Olympics and Paralympics in Paris this summer will also be part of the events at LeBreton Flats.

Elsewhere, ceremonies, shows and other festivities are set to take place in cities across the country.

In Vancouver, 40 people from 18 countries became Canadian citizens in a ceremony to mark the beginning of the festivities at Canada Place.

Not all cities marked the occasion in their usual style. The organizers of Montreal’s Canada Day parade announced last month the event had been cancelled, citing politics and logistical red tape for the move.

Halifax also had to cancel some celebrations Monday due to weather.

An Aug. 30 Facebook post (direct link, archive link) includes an image of a magazine cover with Vogue's branding that features Algerian boxer Imane Khelif.

""The first Algerian, Arab and African woman to win an Olympic boxing gold,"" reads the headline on the purported ""Algeria"" edition of Vogue.

The post's caption reads, ""Algerian olympic champion in boxing honored by Vogue magazine.""

The post was shared more than 100 times in six days. A Threads post included a similar image of Khelif on a supposed cover of Vogue.

The image of the magazine cover is a fabrication that wasn't published under the Vogue brand. It's a piece of fan art that the creator said is meant to celebrate Khelif's talent and cultural significance. There is no ""Vogue Algeria"" edition of the magazine.

Fabricated Vogue covers created by Algeria-based visual artist

Khelif won a gold medal in women's boxing at the Paris Olympics amid intense scrutiny and online harassment about her sex, a topic that generated high levels of interest in the U.S. as it tapped into the volatile politics of gender. The Algerian boxer filed a legal complaint with the Paris public prosecutor's office for ""acts of aggravated cyber harassment.""

But Khelif has not been featured as a celebrity on the cover of Vogue. The image in the Facebook post was created by an Algeria-based visual artist and fan of Khelif's who said it was made using AI applications and Photoshop.

""The artwork envisions Imane on the cover of Vogue magazine, symbolizing her legendary status and unbreakable spirit,"" the artist Cheikh Boumsersseb said in an email. ""She is not only a pride of Algeria and the Arab world but also a beacon of hope for the entire globe.""

Boumsersseb's Instagram page includes a series of digitally fabricated Vogue magazine covers and other pieces featuring Khelif's likeness.

a48018b3a4,Forbes,Facing Up To The Threat Of AI - Forbes,"In 1983, the singer-songwriter Rockwell released a funky pop song with the lyric, “I always feel like somebody’s watching me, and I have no privacy.”

It was a goofy send-up of paranoia, glittered on top of an infectious beat. But these days, the song is more tedious than funny.

We are all being watched and videotaped almost nonstop. Security cameras are everywhere: malls, convenience stores, sandwich shops, parking lots, protests, marches, hospitals, airports, toll booths, ports, and front porches.

In some ways, we love it. Good luck finding a reality crime show that does not have a starring role for closed circuit cameras. Advanced camera systems used by law enforcement have either facial recognition or license plate recognition algorithms.

As a result, the mashup of cameras and artificial intelligence algorithms has quietly become a pervasive factor in our social, political, and economic lives, for better or worse.

The market for this technology is growing at an astounding 22 percent per year, according to some estimates.

Are We Ready for Our Close-Up?

That’s why I find the career and work of Joy Buolamwini so fascinating. She’s the author of Unmasking AI, founder of The Algorithmic Justice League and AI researcher at MIT Media Lab.

She stands at the center of a growing debate about how these technologies affect our lives and how that is changing in worrisome ways.

Her a-ha moment was a 2016 study that estimated one of every two adults in America already has their face registered in a facial recognition database of some kind—databases that are often not vetted for biases.

“This is when I realized the issues I was dealing with with facial analysis systems were not just research and development questions. These systems were getting into the real word in high stakes domains like law enforcement,” she said.

Buolamwini is not reflexively antagonistic toward advanced information technology.

She has seen firsthand how it can be used, for example, to help stem tropical diseases in Ethiopia or improve women’s rights in Zambia. She is cheered by the life-saving pharmaceuticals that may emerge from AI projects such as Alpha Fold.

Killer Robots and Mistaken Handcuffing

In the social and economic sphere, however, she worries about “digital dehumanization.”

In military arena, there are robust debates about the ethical and strategic implications of “killer robots”: aerial, land, and marine drones that can be programmed to attack without human intervention.

“Beyond that, AI can harm people significantly over time through perpetuating structural violence, exhibiting bias and lacking accountability in decision-making processes” Buolamwini said. “AI systems can perpetuate structural violence by denying individuals access to essential services like healthcare, housing, and employment. This denial of fundamental needs can cause irreparable harm to individuals for generations to come.”

She cites cases that would shock Russian novelists such as Dostoevsky and Kafka.

In February 2023, Detroit woman Porcha Woodruff was arrested, handcuffed in front of her two crying daughters, and wrongfully accused of robbery and carjacking on the basis of facial recognition technology. She was eight months pregnant at the time, held for 11 hours in detention and began having contractions while in jail.

Similar cases have occurred in Louisiana and Texas. A preponderance of these cases have involved minorities because image algorithms have more difficulty accurately processing darker skin tones.

In March, Buolamwini provided testimony to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, noting how far ahead this technology is racing ahead of regulation.

She underscored the troubling role of the technology within the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Who’s Zooming Who?

The risk is far from contained to government agencies, however, she argued.

“Our faces are unique. If our face data is leaked, a risk that has become a reality specifically in the context of federal contractor’s data practices, there is little chance to get it back,” she wrote.

“We have seen voice clones and deepfakes used for scams; but when our face data is put at risk, anything from our bank accounts to our benefits could be at risk,” she wrote.

“Even if the image capture date is deleted within minutes, hours, days, or months, we need to know whether and how the government or third-party vendors hold faceprints also known as face template data.”

Facing Up To Problems Through Soft Power

My conversation with Buolamwini focused on how soft power—the changing of conventions, norms, customs, mores, and habits—might be used to address some of these threats.

She talked about how her own behavior has changed. “I am more careful about my biometric rights. When I do recordings and interviews, where possible I generally have a clause that states that the organization cannot use my biometric information—that is my face, my voice, and so forth—to train current or future AI systems,” she said.

“Algorithmic literacy” and “algorithmic hygiene” should become part of the fabric of our social and personal well-being and careers, she said.

“You won’t floss once a year and think you will have good dental health. Likewise we need to continuously be checking the design development and deployment of AI systems,” she said. “We have to think about what we do when something goes wrong for the people I call the excoded, or in other words, those harmed by AI systems. We need to have pathways for redress and design with redress in mind.”

I am by nature an optimist. However, after spending a few hours reflecting on her research and the trend lines of this area of technology and regulation, it’s hard to escape the gnawing feeling that we have yet to witness the worst.

We will need more than harrowing anecdotes, new data, or ethical debates to get a handle on this new era. We will need creativity and a re-conception of the boundary of our public and private lives.

Buolamwini, a graduate of both MIT and Oxford University who has been described as the “conscience of the AI revolution,” recognizes this.

She has turned to a wide array of inspirational platforms ranging from poetry, nonfiction, film, and social media to ring the alarm bell.

She recognizes that we should not need to wait for another miscarriage of justice or public policy catastrophe before we take action. We have enough evidence to act.

Just look around. If you always feel like somebody’s always watching you, you are right. And it’s time we stop thinking this is just another funny, funky thing about the artificial intelligence revolution.","The image features a stylized illustration of a person with a blurred face, wearing a red jacket and sunglasses, with a white mask partially covering their face.

52eb0af557,The New York Times,Climate Group Is Running Ads on Biden Policies in Wisconsin and Michigan - The New York Times,"A climate group with ties to Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington State is running $1 million of television advertising in Michigan and Wisconsin that aims to highlight President Biden’s record on renewable energy.

The ads, which feature two Democratic governors, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Tony Evers of Wisconsin, are among the most significant third-party ads to be broadcast in presidential battleground states so far this cycle.

The group funding them, Evergreen Collaborative, was founded by staff members of Mr. Inslee’s 2020 presidential campaign. Over the past three years, the group spent about $2.5 million on issue advocacy ads in Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin to promote the Inflation Reduction Act, a Michigan clean energy bill and federal pollution standards.

The new ads are set to begin broadcasting on Tuesday and will run for three weeks in Milwaukee and in the Flint and Grand Rapids television markets in Michigan.

What the ads say

Evergreen’s Michigan ad features Ms. Whitmer playing up Mr. Biden’s record — as well as her own — on investing in renewable energy in the state.

“Make it in Michigan,” Ms. Whitmer says while standing in what she says is a job-training center. “It’s what we’re doing every single day.”

As footage of Mr. Biden at the Detroit Auto Show rolls, Ms. Whitmer says that “batteries that used to be made in China are being made all across our state,” an appeal to voters who have been attracted by the anti-China policies of Mr. Biden’s Republican rival in the presidential race, former President Donald J. Trump.

The Wisconsin ad doesn’t show Mr. Evers until the end. It focuses on solar projects, which the ad says will power 750,000 homes in the state.

“Governor Evers is working with the Biden administration to do even more,” the ad’s narrator says as photos are shown of Mr. Evers and Mr. Biden touring a Milwaukee factory last summer. “Your home value goes up and your energy bill goes down.”

The ad concludes with footage of Mr. Evers’s annual State of the State address. “Wisconsinites, this is the future we spent years working hard to build together,” he says.

What the ads are trying to do

These ads are an attempt to capitalize on the popularity of Ms. Whitmer and Mr. Evers, who polls show are far more popular than Mr. Biden in their states.

Because Evergreen is technically an issue-advocacy organization, it is prohibited from making an explicit push to vote for Mr. Biden, but the message here is not subtle. The Michigan ad, with Ms. Whitmer wearing a leather jacket and speaking from a factory floor, could be a Biden campaign ad on its own. The argument boils down to: You like what I’ve done, so support President Biden.

Neither ad mentions the Inflation Reduction Act, the $891 billion law Mr. Biden signed in 2022. Relatively few Americans have heard of the law, and the Democratic Party’s top strategists have discouraged campaigns from referring to it by name.

Instead, with these ads, Evergreen is seeking to remind voters that something they like — building car batteries in Michigan and using solar power in Wisconsin — is brought to them by the Biden administration. Less than six months out from the presidential election, Mr. Biden has failed to convey that message to voters, leaving supportive outside groups and Democratic governors to do it for him.",A woman with brown hair and a red turtleneck is speaking into a microphone.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x117 at 0x7D6BA4961B40>,2024-06-04 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/us/politics/biden-ads-climate-wisconsin-michigan.html,['Politics' 'Weather and Environment'],[0.9 0.7],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/52eb0af557.png
d663bd1544,The New York Times,Elon Musk’s Diplomacy: Woo Right-Wing World Leaders. Then Benefit. - The New York Times,"Minutes after it became clear that Javier Milei had been elected president of South America’s second-largest nation in November, Elon Musk posted on X: “Prosperity is ahead for Argentina.”

Since then, Mr. Musk has continued to use X, the social network he owns, to boost Mr. Milei. The billionaire has shared videos of the Argentine president attacking “social justice” with his 182 million followers. One doctored image, which implied that watching a speech by Mr. Milei was better than having sex, is among Mr. Musk’s most viewed posts ever.

Mr. Musk has helped turn the pugnacious libertarian into one of the new faces of the modern right. But offline, he has used the relationship to press for benefits to his other businesses, the electric carmaker Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX.

“Elon Musk called me,” Mr. Milei said in a television interview weeks after taking office. “He is extremely interested in the lithium.”

Mr. Musk has declared lithium — the silvery-white element that is the main component in Tesla’s car batteries — “the new oil.” Tesla has long bought lithium from Argentina, which has the world’s second-largest reserves. Now Mr. Milei is pushing for major benefits for international lithium miners, which would likely give Tesla a more stable — and potentially cheaper — flow of one of its most critical resources.

Mr. Milei is part of a pattern by Mr. Musk of fostering relationships with a constellation of right-wing heads of state, with clear beneficiaries: his companies and himself.

Mr. Musk, 52, has repeatedly used one piece of his business empire — X, formerly known as Twitter — to vocally support politicians like Mr. Milei, Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil and Narendra Modi of India. On the platform, Mr. Musk has backed their views on gender, feted their opposition to socialism and aggressively confronted their enemies. Mr. Musk even personally intervened in X’s content policies in ways that appeared to aid Mr. Bolsonaro, two former X employees said.

Mr. Musk, in turn, has pushed for and won corporate advantages for his most lucrative businesses, Tesla and SpaceX, according to an examination by The New York Times. In India, he secured lower import tariffs for Tesla’s vehicles. In Brazil, he opened a major new market for Starlink, SpaceX’s satellite internet service. In Argentina, he solidified access to the mineral most crucial to Tesla’s batteries.

Mr. Musk’s endorsement has given many nationalist and right-wing heads of state more international cachet, which they have eagerly promoted as a validation of their policies and popularity. Last month, as India began holding an election, Mr. Modi prepared to host Mr. Musk in New Delhi, calling the billionaire’s visit a testament to his leadership.

But as populism and nationalism spread, Mr. Musk courted Xi Jinping in China and supported Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Italy’s Giorgia Meloni. He began criticizing the “woke mind virus” and what he has declared the failings of the left, which he says have led to issues such as illegal immigration and declining birthrates.

“I guess if you consider fighting the woke mind virus, which I consider to be a civilizational threat, to be political, then yes,” Mr. Musk said in a podcast in November when asked if he was becoming more political. “Woke mind virus is communism rebranded.”

INDIA

A Long Game

In September 2015, Mr. Musk welcomed Mr. Modi to Tesla’s factory in Fremont, Calif. Mr. Modi, a Hindu nationalist politician, had been elected India’s prime minister a year earlier when his Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power, and was visiting the United States to meet business leaders.

Standing under Indian and U.S. flags at the factory, Mr. Musk and Mr. Modi posed for photographs near a gleaming red Model S car. They discussed how “solar panels and battery packs” could power rural regions in India without electrical lines, Mr. Musk said at the time.

India is a potentially massive market for Tesla, which needs to expand to new regions to grow. But the country has virtually barred electric vehicles built by foreign manufacturers. In recent years, the tariff India imposes on imported electric vehicles has risen as high as 100 percent.

Mr. Musk initially used traditional personal diplomacy, meeting with Mr. Modi and ordering his staff at Tesla to get close to officials. In 2017, Tesla sent a letter to India’s government to kick-start talks on operating in the country. Another overture to Mr. Modi’s government in 2019 was rebuffed, three people with knowledge of the company said.

After Mr. Musk bought Twitter in 2022, he had a new lever. The platform, renamed X, is widely used in India — including by Mr. Modi, who has nearly 98 million followers — and is a major forum of political discussion.

Before Mr. Musk owned the platform, Twitter tangled with Mr. Modi’s government. The company, which complies with requests to block certain content in India, had sued the government and challenged its power to censor online material.

Under Mr. Musk, X blocked posts last year that linked to a BBC documentary examining Mr. Modi’s role in the 2002 Hindu-Muslim riots in Gujarat, where he was the chief minister at the time. Twitter’s lawsuit against the Indian government was dismissed in July.

In a discussion last year with Twitter employees, Mr. Musk intimated that he was personally close with Mr. Modi. He said he could easily call the prime minister to take care of a content issue, two former employees said. It’s unclear if any conversation took place.

Mr. Musk met Mr. Modi in person again last June when the prime minister visited New York. He called himself a “fan of Modi” and said Mr. Modi was “pushing us to make significant investment in India, which is something that we intend to do.”

By then, Tesla employees were again talking with Mr. Modi’s advisers about a reduction in tariffs and investing in India, two people familiar with the conversations said. Rohan Patel, who was Tesla’s vice president of public policy and business development, traveled to India several times, and Piyush Goyal, India’s commerce minister, visited the Fremont factory in November.

In January, Mr. Musk posted on X that India should receive a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, which would boost India’s international standing. “India not having a permanent seat on the Security Council, despite being the most populous country on Earth, is absurd,” he wrote.

The timing suggests that Mr. Modi noticed. Two months later, India announced it was reducing some import duties for electric carmakers that committed at least $500 million to produce vehicles in the country. The policy dropped tariffs to 15 percent of a car’s price from 100 percent, specifically for electric vehicles that retail for more than $35,000.

The description fit Tesla to a T. Its Model 3 cars ship at $38,990. BYD, the fast-growing Chinese electric vehicle maker, is barred from investing in India on national security grounds.

Last month, Tesla scouted potential factory sites in three Indian states, three people familiar with the process said. Mr. Musk had also said he would visit Mr. Modi in New Delhi during the country’s multiweek general election, before delaying the trip, citing obligations with Tesla.

Mr. Musk promised not to stay away for long. “I do very much look forward to visiting later this year,” he wrote on X.

BRAZIL

‘True Legend of Freedom’

By 2021, Mr. Musk was employing a similar courtship to bring his Starlink satellite internet service to Brazil, which was then led by Mr. Bolsonaro, the right-wing populist president elected three years earlier. At the time, Starlink was in its infancy, with fewer than 150,000 users across 25 countries.

In October 2021, Fábio Faria, Brazil’s communications minister and an organizer of Mr. Bolsonaro’s re-election campaign, sent a letter to Mr. Musk, saying that “Starlink and Brazil can become great partners,” according to correspondence obtained through the country’s open records laws.

Weeks later, Mr. Faria visited Mr. Musk in Texas. After returning to Brazil, Mr. Faria pushed regulators to approve Starlink, at one point urging Brazil’s space agency to stay out of any debate about SpaceX’s satellites over the country, he later testified to Brazil's Congress.

Brazil’s regulators approved Starlink for operation in December 2021, seven months after the service first applied. It was the fastest of five approvals that regulators granted to satellite internet providers.

Mr. Musk later lent a hand to Mr. Bolsonaro, who faced an uphill battle in his 2022 re-election campaign.

On May 20 that year, Mr. Musk made a surprise trip to Brazil for a major announcement alongside the president. Starlink was coming to the country, and it would provide internet connectivity to 19,000 rural schools, as well as environmental monitoring of the Amazon, they said at an event in a resort near São Paulo. Mr. Bolsonaro gave Mr. Musk a medal and called him a “true legend of freedom” for his bid that year to buy Twitter.

There was just one catch: The plan to connect schools never materialized, said Carlos Baigorri, Brazil’s chief telecommunications regulator, who helped approve Starlink’s entry into the country. “I don’t really think that it even existed,” he said of the plan.

Brazilian officials said they had no record of Starlink’s connecting Brazilian schools for free or conducting environmental monitoring.

Mr. Musk and Mr. Bolsonaro benefited anyway. Mr. Musk had entrenched SpaceX in a critical market, where Starlink now has 150,000 active accounts, according to Brazil’s telecommunications regulator. Mr. Bolsonaro’s campaign got to promote the president’s business acumen and cast him as a defender of the Amazon before an election.

Mr. Musk’s favor did not prevent Mr. Bolsonaro from losing the presidency to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Brazil’s leftist former president, in October 2022. But within weeks, Mr. Musk, who had just completed his deal for Twitter, tried helping Mr. Bolsonaro again.

Mr. Bolsonaro’s supporters had started pushing accusations on Twitter that Brazilian judges had tilted the election by ordering social networks to remove right-wing posts and accounts. As they camped outside military bases demanding the election be overturned, Mr. Musk fed their suspicions by suggesting that Twitter’s former bosses had contributed to Mr. Bolsonaro’s defeat.

“It’s possible that Twitter personnel gave preference to left wing candidates,” he posted in December 2022, without citing any evidence. He later wrote that the company “may have people on the Brazil team that are strongly politically biased.”

Mr. Musk got involved in deciding which posts about Brazil’s election results should stay up or be taken down, two former Twitter employees said. Even after Mr. Musk was briefed about the risk of violence in Brazil that winter, he ordered employees to stop enforcing Twitter’s election rules in the country, including a policy forbidding users to spread misleading claims about election results, they said. He told them to remove only posts that directly incited violence or were subject to a court order.

In January 2023, thousands of Mr. Bolsonaro’s supporters stormed Brazil’s Congress, Supreme Court and presidential offices, under the false belief that the election had been stolen.

Mr. Musk has since used X to attack one of Mr. Bolsonaro’s main political opponents, Alexandre de Moraes, a Brazilian Supreme Court justice who has overseen investigations into the former president and his supporters. X has blocked more than 100 accounts on orders from Justice Moraes, who has said many of them threatened Brazil’s democracy.

“This judge has brazenly and repeatedly betrayed the constitution and people of Brazil,” Mr. Musk posted on X in April. “He should resign or be impeached.”

At a rally called by Mr. Bolsonaro in Rio de Janeiro last month, his supporters held signs thanking Mr. Musk.

When Mr. Bolsonaro addressed the crowd, he hailed the billionaire as “the man who really preserves true freedom for us all.”

ARGENTINA

A Meeting of the Minds

In 2022, one of Tesla’s lithium suppliers announced a $1.1 billion investment to expand in Argentina. Since then, Mr. Musk has taken a keen interest in Argentine politics — and particularly Mr. Milei — leading to one of the most pronounced bromances among Mr. Musk’s political relationships.

Mr. Milei “would be quite a change,” Mr. Musk wrote on X in September in response to a post from the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who had called the then-candidate “Argentina’s next president.”

Mr. Musk has already seen other dividends from Mr. Milei. In one of his first acts as president, Mr. Milei passed an executive order with 366 provisions. When summarizing the highlights of the order in a televised address, Mr. Milei mentioned just one corporate brand by name: Starlink.

SpaceX had pushed for Starlink’s approval in Argentina since 2022, but faced a bureaucratic jam. Mr. Milei quickly cut regulations on satellite internet, and Starlink began operating in the country in March.

Mr. Milei, in turn, has benefited: Mr. Musk has become his most influential online promoter. In January, Mr. Musk shared videos of Mr. Milei’s speech at the World Economic Forum, in which the leader claimed communism and social justice were the main threats to the West.

The posts set off a frenzy of praise for the Argentine across right-wing corners of the internet, including from Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, who met with Mr. Milei in February at the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington. Mr. Milei hugged Mr. Trump and told him he was rooting for him.

Last month, Mr. Milei traveled to Austin, Texas, to visit Mr. Musk at Tesla’s factory there. The two men agreed to “open markets and defend the ideas of freedom,” according to a statement from Mr. Milei’s office. The statement did not mention lithium.

Later, Gerardo Werthein, Argentina’s ambassador to the United States, told the Argentine newspaper La Nación that the pair had indeed discussed Argentina’s mineral reserves.

Mr. Musk “had a very good view of everything we have,” Mr. Werthein said, “especially lithium.”

On Monday, Mr. Musk and Mr. Milei met again, this time at a conference in Los Angeles. Mr. Milei called the entrepreneur “my friend” in a speech in which he praised Mr. Musk’s effort to reach Mars. A few hours later, Mr. Musk posted a photo of the two men with their thumbs up.

“I recommend investing in Argentina,” he wrote.

7bf599a7b3,Financial Times,Labour activists buoyed by return to government after years in wilderness - Financial Times,"Labour activists watched a victory of crushing proportions materialise before their eyes with a sense of disbelief as UK election results emerged in the early hours of Friday morning.

The party last won a general election 19 years ago and has since endured endless false dawns. Leader Sir Keir Starmer has now reversed Labour’s plight after a huge defeat in 2019, producing a huge victory just one parliament later, the most dramatic turnaround in political fortunes since 1945.

“We ran as a changed Labour party, and we will govern as a changed Labour party,” Starmer told cheering supporters at the Tate Modern gallery in London just after dawn.

Ahead of the result, Labour sought to be a model of self-restraint even though polls had consistently forecast a big win for the party since late 2022. It dubbed its election party a “watch event” rather than a celebration, mindful of looking complacent.

But as results unfolded, initial caution gave way to a stunned jubilation.

“I think an electoral meteor has now hit planet Earth,” declared Lord Peter Mandelson, a former Labour cabinet minister.

Activists told the Financial Times they felt “buoyant”, “delighted”, “thrilled” and “over the fucking moon” as they finally let themselves believe the waiting was over and that Labour would be running the UK from Friday.

There were notes of caution in the results. Psephologists forecast that Labour’s share of the vote was set to be lower than the 40 per cent won by former leader Jeremy Corbyn in the party’s unsuccessful 2017 general election.

But this time Starmer’s party benefited from a more even distribution of Labour votes and from the clear split in the rightwing vote between the Tories and Reform UK.

With final results still coming in, Labour’s expected seat numbers are in the ballpark of Sir Tony Blair’s landslide victory in 1997, the high-water mark of the party’s performance in recent decades.

But the Tories are on track to win fewer constituencies than John Major did that year, meaning Starmer will face a weaker opposition.

Labour’s forecast majority in the Commons means Starmer will face few obstacles in pushing through an agenda that includes a far-reaching set of employment reforms, the setting-up of a state-owned energy company called GB Energy, reforming the House of Lords and nationalising the railways.

The incoming prime minister will on Friday enter Downing Street and begin the rapid work of appointing his cabinet and handing out roles within Number 10 to his most trusted aides.

The emphatic nature of the Labour victory is all the more remarkable given how badly the party performed in 2019, when it endured its worst result for nearly a century under hard-left leader Corbyn.

“We were on the brink of extinction,” said Wes Streeting, who will be the new health secretary, on Thursday night.

Starmer became leader a few months later in early 2020. During the Covid-19 pandemic, he sometimes struggled for attention and persistently warned that he had a mountain to climb.

He dropped many of his predecessor’s policies and sought to take Labour to the middle ground of British politics by taking more patriotic and pragmatic positions on issues ranging from Brexit to immigration.

Over the past six weeks the Labour leader ran a largely uneventful and gaffe-free election campaign, attending carefully controlled events usually in front of party staff.

His manifesto was a relatively restrained document with only a handful of tax measures on non-doms, the oil and gas industry, private equity executives and private schools. He has become only the fourth Labour leader to ever win a parliamentary majority in the party’s 124-year history.

Yet Starmer has faced questions from economists about how he will handle some of Britain’s major challenges, given the state of public services and the tight public finances.","A group of people, likely Labour activists, are seen celebrating with raised flags, specifically the Scottish and British flags, in a room with a red and blue color scheme.

86a4a7c123,CNN,Potential of a Trump return inspires Biden and G7 rush to guarantee long-term support for Ukraine - CNN,"President Joe Biden and fellow G7 leaders meeting on the coast of Italy this week are working to harden support for Ukraine and rush western resources to the country as they look uneasily toward November’s US election, which could portend a shift in American stance.

The plans to hasten tens of billions of dollars to the besieged nation and ink a security agreement between Washington and Kyiv that helps Ukraine achieve self-sufficiency were intended to demonstrate resolve – and a degree of political creativity – amid Russian battlefield momentum.

“Collectively, this is a powerful set of actions, and it will create a stronger foundation for Ukraine’s success,” Biden said during a news conference Thursday alongside his counterpart from Kyiv, Volodymyr Zelensky, who wore his usual army green uniform.

Calling Russia’s invasion a “test for the world,” the US leader said he and his allies at the G7 had consistently answered “yes” to the question of whether they would stand by Ukraine.

“We will say it again,” he said. “Yes, again and again and again.”

Yet whether the measures agreed to this week can withstand another Donald Trump presidency remained something of an unknown. As Biden was finalizing his agreements in Italy, Trump was meeting with Republicans on Capitol Hill, where he once again made clear he didn’t want to see another $60 billion in aid flowing to Ukraine, according to a person familiar with his comments. Trump argued, as he had before, that if he were president the war wouldn’t still be going.

Opposed to additional Ukraine aid and openly skeptical of NATO, Trump could rip up the bilateral agreement Biden signed Thursday if he returned to office.

“If Trump is inaugurated at noon on the 20 of January next year, by about five after noon he could have dissolved this agreement in its entirety,” said John Bolton, a former national security adviser to Trump. “So, if you can’t bind a future president who doesn’t want to be bound, and that includes getting out of treaties, which this isn’t even a treaty, I think there may actually be a bit of a downside here when Trump hears about this and concludes they’re trying to lock him in, that will just make him more irritated.”

Such a move would be in keeping with Trump’s decisions during his previous term to abandon foreign policy agreements negotiated by his Democratic predecessor, including the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal. Few European diplomats hold out hope for a change in tactic a second time around.

The memories from those years are still fresh for some G7 leaders and have helped drive the urgency in finding ways to funnel support to Ukraine at this year’s summit, before Trump’s prospective return.

Speaking at the news conference with Biden, Zelensky said it was up to the American people to demonstrate to their leader – whoever he is – that standing with Ukraine is a priority.

“It seems to me that no matter whom the nation chooses, first and foremost, it seems to me that everything depends on the unity within this or that state,” he said through a translator. “And if the people are with us, any leader will be with us in this struggle for freedom.”

Upcoming US election sparks urgency

The forthcoming election helped create an impetus to finalize a long-debated plan to give Ukraine a $50 billion loan using interest earned on frozen Russian assets. American and European diplomats had been working through the technicalities of such a proposal for months.

European officials were initially reluctant, raising concerns that they could be on the hook if Ukraine failed to pay back the loan, the investments generated less profit or the assets get delivered back to Russia as part of a peace deal.

Yet with uncertainty swirling around any American support in the future, the time to act appeared short. That the differences were resolved during a heated US election, in which one of the candidates openly opposes providing Ukraine any more aid, was not lost on many of the negotiators.

“There was shared recognition here in Puglia by every G7 member that the situation on the battlefield remains difficult, and that if the war continues, Ukraine is still going to have a large financial need next year and beyond, and that this summit is our best chance to act collectively to close the gap,” a senior US administration official said. “This agreement is a signal from the leading democracies of the world that we’re not going to fatigue on defending Ukraine’s freedom, and that Putin is not going to outlast us.”

Officials said Ukraine would receive the first payments from the scheme sometime this year but would need additional time to use up all of the money being sent.

“It is a very strong message to make sure that it is not us paying for the Russian damage, but it is Russia who has to pay,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.

Security deal faces uncertain future in a Trump presidency

The deal, in the end, was about more than just money. It was proof, in Biden’s mind, that likeminded allies can overcome differences for the greater good — in this case, helping a besieged democratic nation rebuild its infrastructure after an invasion by Russia.

So, too, was his decision to sign a bilateral security accord with Zelensky intended to demonstrate long-term American commitment – even though the agreement has no guarantee of surviving if Trump wins.

The agreement follows months of negotiations between the US and Ukraine and commits the US for 10 years to continued training of Ukraine’s armed forces, more cooperation in the production of weapons and military equipment, the continued provision of military assistance and greater intelligence sharing.

Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan called the pact a “real marker” of the American commitment to Ukraine “not just for this month and this year, but for the many years ahead.”

And Biden, speaking in Italy, said the pact was designed to make Ukraine more self-sufficient — and, by extension, less dependent on shifting American sentiments.

“Our goal is to strengthen Ukraine’s credible defense and deterrence capabilities for the long term,” he said. “A lasting peace for Ukraine must be underwritten by Ukraine’s own ability to defend itself now and to deter future aggression anytime in the future.”

Still, the pledge is an “executive agreement,” making it less formal than a treaty and not necessarily binding for any future presidents. And it does not contain any new money and is instead “subject to the availability of appropriated funds,” according to its text.

After a drawn-out battle this year with congressional Republicans to pass $60 billion for Ukraine — causing Biden to apologize last week for delays that US officials say helped Russia regain momentum on the battlefield — there is little likelihood the president will go back to Congress this year for additional funding.

Biden pushes G7 to back reproductive rights

Even on an issue unrelated to Ukraine, Biden sought this week to consolidate G7 support in a way that would be unlikely if Trump were to return to the summit.

Behind the scenes, he and US officials pushed to keep language about reproductive rights in a G7 leaders’ statement after the summit host, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, sought to strip some language from the document, according to American officials.

The back-and-forth illustrated some of the fraught dynamics at play at the summit. Biden has worked to make protecting abortion rights a centerpiece of his reelection bid, and a key point of contrast with Trump.

“The president felt very strongly that we needed to have at the very least the language that references what we did in Hiroshima on women’s health and reproductive rights,” a senior US administration official said, referring to last year’s G7 summit in Japan.

In that document, leaders reiterated their support for “access to safe and legal abortion and post abortion care.” It also expressed “strong concern about the rollback of women’s and girls’ rights.”

The trip to the rocky Adriatic coast this week is likely to be Biden’s final time abroad before November’s elections, and a final moment to harden alliances in person and seal agreements before the unknowable outcome of the vote.

American allies in Europe are collectively preparing for a second Trump administration with a sense both of trepidation and exhaustion. During diplomatic visits and quiet pull-asides at summits like the G7, it is a topic of constant conversation.

French luminaries who were invited to the Élysée Palace last week for a state dinner in honor of Biden openly discussed their anxiety about Trump’s potential return to the White House, according to a person who attended.

Those who lived through the experience the first time around have little appetite for a return to the open animosity and norm-busting rituals that came with Trump wherever he went, be it battles over climate on a cliffside in Sicily, haggling on trade in the forests of Quebec or an argument over readmitting Russia at a lighthouse in Biarritz.

By the end of his term, Trump had begun questioning the utility of attending the gatherings at all, fed up with what he saw as an unpleasant and unwelcoming experience.","Two men shaking hands in front of a podium with a sign reading 'UNITED STATES-BILATERAL SECURITY AGREEMENT 2024'.

47e83e6b92,Global News Toronto,Biden campaign chair says he’s staying in the race despite ‘slippage’ in support - Global News Toronto,"President Joe Biden’s campaign is insisting anew that he is not stepping aside as he faces the stark reality that many Democrats at the highest levels want him to bow out of the 2024 election to make way for a new nominee and try to prevent widespread party losses in November.

Isolated as he battles a COVID-19 infection at his beach house in Delaware, Biden’s already small circle of confidants before his debate fumbling has shrunk further. The president, who has insisted he can beat Republican Donald Trump, is with family and relying on a few longtime aides as he weighs whether to bow to the mounting pressure to drop out.

Biden campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillion acknowledged “slippage” in support for the president, but insisted he is “absolutely” remaining in the race and that the campaign sees “multiple paths” to beating Trump.

“We have a lot of work to do to reassure the American people that yes he’s old, but he can win,” she told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” show. But she said voters concerned about Biden’s fitness to lead aren’t switching to vote for Trump. “They have questions, but they are staying with Joe Biden,” she said.

At the same time, the Democratic National Committee ’s rulemaking arm opened its meeting Friday, pressing ahead with plans for a virtual roll call before Aug. 7 to nominate the presidential pick, ahead of the party’s convention later in the month in Chicago.

“President Biden deserves the respect to have important family conversations with members of the caucus and colleagues in the House and Senate and Democratic leadership and not be battling leaks and press statements,” Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, Biden’s closest friend in Congress and his campaign co-chair, told The Associated Press.

It’s a pivotal few days for the president and his party: Trump has wrapped up an enthusiastic Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. And Democrats, racing time, are considering the extraordinary possibility of Biden stepping aside for a new presidential nominee before their own convention.

Amid the turmoil, a majority of Democrats think Vice President Kamala Harris would make a good president herself.

A poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that about 6 in 10 Democrats believe Harris would do a good job in the top slot. About 2 in 10 Democrats don’t believe she would, and another 2 in 10 say they don’t know enough to say.

Democrats at the highest levels have been making a critical push for Biden to rethink his election bid, with former President Barack Obama expressing concerns to allies and Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi privately telling Biden the party could lose the ability to seize control of the House if he doesn’t step away from the 2024 race.

Late Thursday, Montana Sen. Jon Tester became the second Democrat in the chamber — and now among two dozen in Congress — calling on him to bow out, saying, “Biden should not seek reelection to another term.”

And Friday, four more House Democrats — Reps. Jared Huffman, Mark Veasey, Chuy Garcia and Mark Pocan — representing a wide swath of the caucus called on Biden to step aside.

“It is now time for you to pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders,” they wrote. “We must defeat Donald Trump to save our democracy.”

And Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois wrote in an op-ed Friday that with “a heavy heart and much personal reflection” he, too, was calling on Biden to “pass the torch to a new generation.”

That brings to more than two dozen the Democrats in Congress urging Biden to step out of the race.

Campaign officials said Biden was even more committed to staying in the race even as the calls for him to go mounted. And senior West Wing aides have had no internal discussions or conversations with the president about Biden dropping out.

What happened at the Harris-Trump debate? Here are the key takeaways

Acetaminophen among Health Canada recalls from Canadian pharma brand

On Friday, Biden picked up a key endorsement from the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. CHC BOLD PAC said the Biden administration has shown “unwavering commitment” to Latinos and “the stakes couldn’t be higher” in this election. “President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have delivered for the Latino community,” the group said.

But there is also time to reconsider. Biden has been told the campaign is having trouble raising money, and key Democrats see an opportunity as he is away from the campaign for a few days to encourage his exit. Among his Cabinet, some are resigned to the likelihood of him losing in November.

The reporting in this story is based in part on information from almost a dozen people who insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive private deliberations. The Washington Post first reported on Obama’s involvement.

Biden, 81, tested positive for COVID-19 while traveling in Las Vegas earlier this week and is experiencing “mild symptoms” including “general malaise” from the infection, the White House said.

The president himself, in a radio interview taped just before he tested positive, dismissed the idea it was too late for him to recover politically, telling Univision’s Luis Sandoval that many people don’t focus on the November election until September.

“All the talk about who’s leading and where and how, is kind of, you know — everything so far between Trump and me has been basically even,” he said in an excerpt of the interview released Thursday.

But in Congress, Democratic lawmakers have begun having private conversations about lining up behind Harris as an alternative. One lawmaker said Biden’s own advisers are unable to reach a unanimous recommendation about what he should do. More in Congress are considering joining the others who have called for Biden to drop out. Some prefer an open process for choosing a new presidential nominee.

“It’s clear the issue won’t go away,” said Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, the other Senate Democrat who has publicly said Biden should exit the race. Welch said the current state of party angst — with lawmakers panicking and donors revolting — was “not sustainable.”

However, influential Democrats including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries are sending signals of strong concern.

To be sure, many want Biden to stay in the race. But among Democrats nationwide, nearly two-thirds say Biden should step aside and let his party nominate a different candidate, according to an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll. That sharply undercuts Biden’s post-debate claim that “average Democrats” are still with him.","A man in a dark suit and cap stands in front of a podium with the Presidential Seal of the United States, suggesting a political context.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BA4EFAC20>,2024-07-19 16:10:26+00:00,https://globalnews.ca,https://globalnews.ca/news/10632751/biden-campaign-chair-staying-in-the-race-slippage-support/,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/47e83e6b92.png
a9634e8d7e,The New York Times,Biden Shut the Border to Asylum Seekers. The Question Is Whether the Order Can Be Enforced. - The New York Times,"As of 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, the U.S. border with Mexico was shut down to nearly all migrants seeking asylum in the United States.

The drastic action, the result of an executive order signed by President Biden, was designed to keep the border closed at least through Election Day and defuse one of the president’s biggest vulnerabilities in his campaign against former President Donald J. Trump.

The question is how broadly it can be enforced, especially along a 2,000-mile border that does not have nearly the capacity to manage the number of people who want to enter the United States.

As of Wednesday morning and into Thursday, the order appeared to be working, although it was still too early to make a real assessment. Migrants in the border towns of Mexicali and Ciudad Juárez were being turned away, and the word was spreading.

In Mexicali, Guadalupe Olmos, a 33-year-old mother, said that when she heard about the new policy, she wept, and said it was now pointless to try to enter the United States. Last year, she said, gunmen shot up her car, killing her husband. She and her three children survived and have been trying to get out of Mexico.

“It is not going to happen anymore,” Ms. Olmos said. “Yesterday, they told us that this is over.”

Before the new restrictions went into effect, migrants would seek out border agents and surrender, knowing that anyone who stepped foot on U.S. soil could ask for asylum. Often, they would be released into the United States to wait, sometimes for years, for their cases to come up.

Mr. Biden’s new order prevents that. But there are plenty of ways for people to get into the country along the border — running from California to Texas — particularly without any new resources to help guard the frontier.

The office of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection releases the number of crossings every month, so it will be weeks before the effects of Mr. Biden’s directive begin to become clear.

But the main problem for the White House is that Republicans have blocked billions in funding that would have helped enforce the order, raising questions about just how transformative it will be at a moment of massive migration around the world.

“None of this solves the long-term problems,” said John Sandweg, who was a top official at the Department of Homeland Security during the Obama administration. “Until Congress acts, we’re still going to have major problems at the border.”

Mr. Biden, under enormous political pressure to address illegal immigration, issued the executive action this week after Republicans in Congress torpedoed a bipartisan bill in February that also would have shut down the border.

The key difference between that legislation and Mr. Biden’s executive order is money. Mr. Biden cannot use his executive authority to send billions of dollars in resources to the border; he needs Congress to do that.

But Mr. Trump, who has made being tough on immigration a hallmark of his political brand, had called on Republicans to kill the legislation, even though it included some of the most restrictive measures Congress has contemplated in years.

On Tuesday, Mr. Biden blamed Republicans for forcing his hand but said the “simple truth” was that he needed to secure the border.

He will have to do that without the money that was in the bill, including more than $7 billion to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for deportation flights and other expenses; $4 billion to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for asylum officers; and more than $6 billion for U.S. Customs and Border Protection for more border agents and other resources.

The legislation also would have paid for more immigration judges to try to plow through a backlog of two million asylum cases.

The new restrictions lift only when the number of illegal crossings drops to fewer than 1,500 for seven days in a row and stays that way for two weeks. The numbers have not been that low in years; in December, there were some 10,000 illegal crossings every day.

More recently, the figures have hovered around 3,000 crossings per day.

If the numbers do fall below the threshold, they will kick in again once the seven-day average for daily illegal crossings hits 2,500 — a regular occurrence now.

Assuming the executive order survives legal challenges, which are expected, it could be in effect for months or longer.

“The threshold that they set is incredibly, unrealistically low for a moment of historic worldwide migration,” said Adam Isacson of the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights organization. “That’s no mathematical accident: It is low enough to guarantee that the right to asylum between ports of entry won’t come back anytime soon.”

The new policy changed the plans of Ibeth María del Villar San Juan, who arrived in Ciudad Juárez from Venezuela on Monday with her husband and 8-year-old daughter.

The family had planned to cross the Rio Grande and turn themselves in to U.S. border agents. But after learning that if they crossed illegally they could lose the possibility of receiving asylum, they decided to stay in Mexico to plan their next move.

“One crosses with the expectation of receiving asylum,” she said, “but if now we can lose the opportunity, we’d better wait.”

0f946ff4c0,The New York Times,Dozens Arrested at U.Va. as Others Show Defiance at Commencement - The New York Times,"Other protests have extended from campus property to commencement. At the University of Michigan’s ceremony, pro-Palestinian supporters briefly disrupted the ceremony and were met by state police. At Indiana University in Bloomington, students walked out of the commencement remarks in protest.

School officials have struggled with how to respond to the protests as they try to balance free speech with campus security. For the graduation ceremonies, some universities plan to set up designated areas for protests in an attempt to allow the ceremonies to go forward without suppressing speech.

Among other schools set to hold ceremonies this weekend are Northeastern University and Ohio State University — both universities that have grappled with unrest over student protests.

Across the country, more than 2,300 people have been arrested or detained on campuses in the past two weeks, according to a tally by The New York Times.

Here is what else to know:

In Charlottesville, Va., at least three law enforcement agencies moved in to clear out the protesters at the University of Virginia, who said their demonstration was peaceful. Police officials said two people had been released, and all those arrested had been charged with trespassing.

Dozens of protesters were arrested at the Art Institute of Chicago on Saturday, after the museum asked the police to intervene and remove demonstrators from museum property.

The University of Mississippi said it was investigating at least one student after counterprotesters directed racist taunts at pro-Palestinian protesters this week, school officials said. The university chancellor, Glenn F. Boyce, said that statements made at the demonstration were “offensive, hurtful and unacceptable.”

The University of Michigan has seen repeated protests during its graduation festivities. One person was arrested Friday evening during a protest outside a dinner for recipients of honorary degrees, while the Saturday graduation ceremony saw cheers and boos as people brought Palestinian flags down the venue’s aisles.

At the University of Chicago, which adopted a set of free speech standards in 2015 that have been adopted by colleges across the country, the school’s president said an encampment there “cannot continue,” citing disruptions and vandalism.

A handful of universities have agreed to some of the protesters’ demands, bringing peaceful ends to demonstrations but also criticism from some Jewish groups. The schools announcing agreements this week included the University of California, Riverside; Brown; Northwestern; Rutgers; and the University of Minnesota. It is unclear how many of them might work.

An earlier version of this article misstated where Art Institute of Chicago students were protesting. They were protesting at the museum, not the school.

How we handle corrections

Jim Ryan, the university president, wrote in a letter to the campus, “I sincerely wish it were otherwise, but this repeated and intentional refusal to comply with reasonable rules intended to secure the safety, operations and rights of the entire university community left us with no other choice than to uphold the neutral application and enforcement of those rules.”

By Saturday afternoon, protesters were met with police officers in riot gear. At one point, the police used chemical irritants against the crowd to get people to disperse.

The university said it was not immediately clear how many of the 25 who were arrested were affiliated with the school. All were charged with trespassing, according to a police official.

“Shame on you, shame on you!” chanted a crowd of hundreds of students and Charlottesville locals as a combined force of dozens of officers from at least three law enforcement agencies pushed them into the street in front of the university’s Rotunda building.

“This is absolutely obscene,” said Colden Dorfman, a third-year student majoring in computer science, who faced down the cordon as the police sprayed chemical irritants. “This is insanity. Everyone came here with peaceful intentions. I’m ashamed that this is what our police force is being used for.”

Some protesters and their supporters directly questioned the magnitude of the police response, particularly compared with the school’s response in 2017 to hundreds of white nationalists marching on campus with torches.

“What did you do when the K.K.K. came to town?” protesters could be heard yelling, as the police moved to push them into University Avenue, which had been blocked off to traffic.

Even as it began to rain, hundreds of people remained for hours before dispersing. Some people headed to the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail, where a new protest was forming.

At least a dozen officers from the Michigan State Police quickly followed to block the parade from making it to the stage, urging protesters to retreat to the back of the graduates section.

As the chants reverberated throughout the stadium and demonstrators talked to the police, some students got up from their seats and joined in, disobeying police officers who told them to sit down.

But other students — some with the Star of David on their caps — were enraged by the disruption and demanded that the protesters be kicked out. “You’re ruining our graduation!” one yelled. Some patrons in private boxes hung Israeli flags from their seats.

Once the demonstrators moved to the back of the ceremony, tensions simmered, and the protest remained peaceful. University officials said that peaceful protests are not uncommon at graduation or university events.

The chants never stopped — though how audible and distracting it was might have depended on where people sat in the stadium — but the audience returned their attention to the stage as the ceremony carried on.

About a mile away from graduation, a pro-Palestinian encampment on the university’s Diag, a central quadrangle on campus, was abuzz with campers, activists and recently graduated students and their parents.

Nestled between brick academic buildings and lush greenery, the encampment sits just outside the steps of a library and not far from a busy pedestrian strip of shops and restaurants. The occupation has seen as many as 200 protesters overnight and includes dozens of tents.

Salma Hamamy, 22, one of the organizers of the encampment, was still wearing her graduation cap and gown after marching down the aisle in protest at commencement. She does not regret protesting at her graduation — a “once in a lifetime” moment, she said.

“It would feel completely wrong of me to not use graduation as an opportunity to call attention to this. That’s where all the regents are,” she said. “It’s important that they can physically see us. They can’t ignore us.”

Jonathan Ellis contributed reporting.

He added, “To be clear, people who say horrible things to people because of who they are will not find shelter or comfort on this campus.”

Video captured by the Mississippi Free Press and the Daily Mississippian showed a crowd of white male students jeering and taunting a lone Black woman standing in front of the protest on campus, with one man making monkey gestures and hooting at her. Another video compilation showed the men yelling profane and derogatory insults.

The few dozen pro-Palestinian protesters appeared widely outnumbered by the crowd of counterdemonstrators, though university officials said no one was arrested or injured.

Gov. Tate Reeves of Mississippi, a Republican, approvingly captioned a separate video of the demonstrations that showed the counterprotesters singing “The Star-Spangled Banner” over the protest chants, though he made no mention of the other video clips that soon circulated. And former President Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, also shared a separate video on social media from the protests where the men could be heard chanting “we want Trump.”

The university has a painful history of racist episodes, and, for some, the videos evoked the mob and deadly riots that sought to stop the enrollment of James Meredith, the first Black student at the school, in 1962. And while the school has shed some of its Confederate imagery, in 2012, two students were arrested after racial slurs were chanted at a protest over former President Barack Obama’s re-election. In 2014, a noose was placed around a statue of Mr. Meredith.

“It is important to acknowledge our challenging history, and incidents like this can set us back,” Mr. Boyce wrote. “It is one reason why we do not take this lightly and cannot let the unacceptable behavior of a few speak for our institution or define us.”

The divestment language did not mention Israel or the war in the Gaza Strip, as the protesters had in their demands.

But Dr. Bradley said administrators had also agreed to “recruit and support Palestinian students and scholars-at-risk, who have lost educational and professional opportunities” since Oct. 7, a reference to the attacks in Israel by Hamas and its allies that prompted Israel’s war in Gaza.

“With these commitments, the college will work to improve our understanding, dialogue about, and educational programming concerning peace and conflict, with focus on Gaza and the Middle East,” she said.

The Vassar agreement is one of several in which student protesters have agreed to clear camps in exchange for commitments to discuss institutional investment policies around Israel. Students for Justice in Palestine at Vassar, the group that organized the encampment and negotiated with administrators, said in a statement on social media that it did not feel like a victory.

“We are not happy about the concessions we’ve made, but our work is not done,” the group said in the statement, adding that the administration had not agreed to all of the demands laid out by protesters when they launched the encampment. Those demands included calls for the Vassar administration to release a public statement calling for “an immediate end to Israel’s siege on Gaza and an end to U.S. aid for Israel,” and to completely boycott Israeli academic institutions, including Vassar-sponsored study abroad programs in Israel.

“At this time, we believe this is the most strategic decision we can make in order to further our efforts for divestment and Palestinian liberation,” the students said of the agreement.

They said they would donate the roughly $7,000 they had raised since launching their encampment to families in Gaza, and redistribute any donated supplies to people and organizations in Poughkeepsie.

In a speech on Saturday to honor the victims, Sophia Swengel, a sophomore and the president of the May 4 Task Force, a group formed in 1975 to keep the students’ legacy alive, also acknowledged the protesters. Many of them were hoisting signs calling on the university to divest from weapons manufacturers and military contractors.

“Once again students are taking a stand against bloodshed abroad,” she said, referring to Israel’s assault on Gaza, which followed the Hamas-led attack of Oct. 7. “Much like they did against the Vietnam War back in the ’60s,” Ms. Swengel added.

Among the student demands in 1970 were abolishing the R.O.T.C. program, ending the university’s ties with police training programs and halting the research and development of the liquid crystal used in heat detectors that guided bombs dropped on Cambodia.

Today, demonstrators at Kent State are asking the university to divest its portfolio of instruments of war. “The university is profiting from war, and they were arguing in ’69 and ’70 that the university was also profiting from war,” said Camille Tinnin, a 31-year-old Ph.D. student studying political science who has met with the school’s administration to discuss divestiture.

While Kent State cannot end the war in Gaza, “what the university can control is its own investment portfolio,” said Yaseen Shaikh, 19, a member of Students for Justice in Palestine who is about to graduate with a degree in computer science.

Ms. Tinnin and Mr. Shaikh, along with two other students, met with Mark Polatajko, senior vice president for finance and administration for Kent State, on Dec. 4, a meeting confirmed in a statement from Rebecca Murphy, a Kent State spokeswoman. Mr. Polatajko shared the university’s investment portfolio with the four activists during the meeting, Ms. Tinnin said in an interview before Saturday’s protest. She said activists who scrutinized the portfolio found that it included investments in weapons manufacturers.

On Saturday, in a nod to nationwide student demonstrations against the war in Gaza, Ms. Swengel said that encampments and demonstrations “stand as living, breathing monuments of the willingness of students to stand up against genocide and for what they believe in.”

In a statement emailed to reporters, Ms. Murphy said the university “upholds the First Amendment rights of free speech and peaceful assembly for all.”

“Consistent with our core values, we encourage open dialogue and respectful civil discourse in an inclusive environment,” she added.

“We have been looking forward to celebrating this moment with you,” she said at one point in her brief remarks. She made no mention of the protests.

The second batch of protesters walked out during a speech by the commencement speaker, the tech entrepreneur Scott Dorsey. Protesters chanted “Free, free Palestine” as they filed out. They were drowned out by boos.

Lauren Ulrich, 21, of Rolla, Mo., graduated on Saturday with degrees in journalism and environmental studies. But she did not stay at the commencement ceremony long enough to turn her tassel. Her decision to walk out was one that Ms. Ulrich said she had not made lightly.

“I think sometimes it is scary to do the right thing,” she said. “I was scared. But people are dying and there’s no way I could not do something about it.”

After months of participating in protests and the school’s encampment, Ms. Ulrich said she planned to leave campus the day after graduation. She said she was “incredibly sad” but felt that the protest movement had enough supporters to keep up momentum over the summer.

“I think they will get creative in how they will continue it,” Ms. Ulrich said.

Liz Capp, 22, of Indianapolis, graduated on Saturday with a degree in therapy and did not participate in the protest. Before the ceremony, she anticipated that there would be some kind of demonstration. But it had not concerned her.

“Everyone has the right to peacefully protest,” she said.

In the hours after his announcement, hundreds of protesters remained at the encampment, where they chanted and held signs as counterprotesters gathered nearby. At one point, some pro-Palestinian demonstrators and counterprotesters briefly fought one another. By early afternoon, more police officers, both from the university and the city, were visible near the quad.

The scene had quieted down, at least temporarily, by early Friday evening. Several security guards were stationed around the quad, where protesters moved quietly around their encampment while others studied or walked nearby. There was no effort by law enforcement to forcibly disband the encampment.

Chicago’s mayor, Brandon Johnson, issued a statement saying he had been in touch with Dr. Alivisatos and had “made clear my commitment to free speech and safety on college campuses.”

Like at dozens of colleges across the country, Chicago students have erected tents on campus and issued a set of demands to administrators, including divesting from weapons manufacturers. A member of a group leading the encampment, UChicago United for Palestine, accused the university of “negotiating in bad faith” in a statement on Friday.

The protest group “refuses to accept President Alivisatos’s repeated condescending offer of a public forum to discuss ‘diverse viewpoints’ on the genocide, as this is clearly a poor attempt at saving face without material change,” said Christopher Iacovetti, a student who participated in negotiations.

Dr. Alivisatos, a chemist who became president of the university in 2021, said in his message to campus that the encampment had become far more than a cluster of tents. He accused protesters of vandalizing buildings, blocking walkways, destroying a nearby installation of Israeli flags and flying a Palestinian flag from a university flagpole.

“The encampment has created systematic disruption of campus,” Dr. Alivisatos said. “Protesters are monopolizing areas of the Main Quad at the expense of other members of our community. Clear violations of policies have only increased.”

The University of Chicago, a private college that is one of the country’s most selective, has been praised by conservatives and free speech advocates in recent years for its approach to expression on its campus.

As part of its free speech philosophy, the university also put forward the principle of institutional neutrality.

In a 1967 declaration, the university called for schools to remain neutral on political and social matters, saying a campus “is the home and sponsor of critics; it is not itself the critic.” But at other colleges, students over the years have frequently and successfully pressed their administrations to take positions on matters like police brutality and global warming.

In August 2016, the University of Chicago informed incoming freshmen: “We do not support so-called trigger warnings, we do not cancel invited speakers because their topics might prove controversial, and we do not condone the creation of intellectual safe spaces where individuals can retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own.”

Versions of the university’s declaration of free speech principles have been adopted by dozens of other colleges in recent years.

“In a word, the university’s fundamental commitment is to the principle that debate or deliberation may not be suppressed because the ideas put forth are thought by some or even by most members of the university community to be offensive, unwise, immoral or wrong-headed,” that declaration said.

But the statement also describes clear limits, including a right to prohibit illegal activities and speech “that constitutes a genuine threat or harassment.”

In a letter to the campus community on Friday, the school’s chancellor, Kim Wilcox, said that his goal had been to resolve this peacefully and that he was encouraged by the result. He said that school leaders had been meeting with leaders of the student encampment on campus since Wednesday.

The school’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine called the agreement “a win for all of us” in a statement posted on Instagram, adding that all of its demands were met.

The school also agreed, at the request of students, to review the availability of Sabra hummus on campus. Pro-Palestinian activists have frequently called on people to boycott the brand over the years, as one of Sabra’s joint owners is the Strauss Group, an Israeli food company. In 2010, the Strauss Group said on its website that it had provided financial support to part of Israel’s military force. And today it says it maintains contact with “IDF divisions.” Sabra is co-owned by PepsiCo. Efforts to reach that company were unsuccessful.

The agreement at U.C. Riverside is not the first between protesters and universities since protests on campus began against the war in Gaza.

Earlier this week, officials at Brown University also made an agreement with pro-Palestinian protesters. Demonstrators agreed to dismantle their encampment at Brown, which had been removed by Tuesday evening, and university leaders said they would discuss, and later vote on, divesting funds from companies connected to the Israeli military campaign in Gaza.

Several days ago, an agreement was reached between Northwestern University and the pro-Palestinian demonstrators on campus. The agreement included a promise by the university to be more transparent about its financial holdings. In turn, demonstrators removed the tent camp they built last week at Deering Meadow, a stretch of lawn on campus.

Jewish leaders, including officials from the American Jewish Committee, strongly objected to the agreement at Northwestern, saying it “succumbed to the demands of a mob,” and seven members of a Northwestern committee created to advise the university’s president on preventing antisemitism stepped down in protest on Wednesday.

Agreements between school administrators and student protesters have also taken place at other schools, including Rutgers University.

The professor walked away with a case of whiplash. But a short video clip of the episode flew around the internet, intensifying the debate over the relatively swift decision by Dartmouth’s president, Sian Leah Beilock, to call in police to arrest students and clear out an encampment.

Unlike other campuses where tents were tolerated for days, the police action at Dartmouth began a little more than two hours after the encampment first appeared, according to the college’s newspaper, The Dartmouth, and students who observed the events on Wednesday.

Dr. Beilock defended her decision.

“Last night, people felt so strongly about their beliefs that they were willing to face disciplinary action and arrest,” Dr. Beilock said in a message to campus on Thursday. “While there is bravery in that, part of choosing to engage in this way is not just acknowledging — but accepting — that actions have consequences.”

Dr. Beilock did not directly address the treatment of Dr. Orleck, who called the message “outrageous.”

“Her actions have consequences, too,” Dr. Orleck said in an interview. “The campus is in an uproar. Neither the students nor the faculty have been as radicalized in a long time as they’re feeling today.”

“I’ve been teaching here for 34 years,” she added. “There have been many protests, but I’ve never, ever seen riot police called to the green.” Dartmouth declined to comment on the incident.

How to handle the encampments has become a grinding challenge for university administrators. Earlier this month, the decision by Columbia University’s president to call in police stirred up protests at campuses across the country.

Demonstrations over the war in Gaza have led to more than 2,000 arrests over the last two weeks at universities across the country, according to a New York Times tally. The arrests have also angered some faculty, who have sometimes stepped in to try to help students.

The police in Hanover, N.H., the home of Dartmouth, said that the arrested included students and nonstudents, but did not provide a breakdown. The charges included criminal trespassing and resisting arrest. When the Hanover Police Department and the state police asked students to disperse, some did and others didn’t, police officials said.

It was unclear what disciplinary action, if any, the arrested students would face from the university.

Dr. Orleck said she was charged with criminal trespass and temporarily banned from campus, as a condition of her bail. The college’s administrators said on Thursday that the suspension was an error in the bail process, which they were working to fix.

In her message, Dr. Beilock strongly defended the decision to sweep away the encampment. And, she said, a key demand of protesters — that trustees vote on divestment from companies connected with Israel — violated the rules for making such decisions.

“Dartmouth’s endowment is not a political tool,” she said, “and using it to take sides on such a contested issue is an extraordinarily dangerous precedent to set.”

Dr. Orleck, who once served as the head of Jewish studies at the university, said she had watched with unease as police confrontations with student protesters escalated across the country.

She said she wanted to be at the Dartmouth protest because as an older Jewish professor — joined by many other older Jewish professors — her presence, she thought, could help keep her students safe.

As the police moved in, arresting students, Dr. Orleck said she started taking videos.

“I said to them, and I said it with some anger, ‘Leave our students alone. They’re students. They’re not criminals,’” she said. “The next thing I knew, I was rushed from the back.”

Messages left for the local and state police were not immediately returned.

One of the short viral videos begins with Dr. Orleck tumbling to the ground. She gets up. She moves toward an officer with her hand extended — grasping for her phone, she said. She is jerked and knocked down again. It is unclear what took place before the video begins.

Ivy Schweitzer, a recently retired English professor at the college, said the situation took a turn when campus security stepped back, and outside law enforcement moved in to make the arrests.

Dr. Orleck, she said, was recording the police with her phone.

“Annelise would never be physical with a police officer,” Dr. Schweitzer said. “But she would put her phone in their face, and I’m sure they wouldn’t like that.”

Over the last six months, the university has released numerous letters to its students, faculty and alumni regarding the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack, the war in Gaza and the related protests and unrest on campus. But the video released on Friday was the first one by Dr. Shafik released on the school’s Vimeo page in months.

In the video message, Dr. Shafik discussed the need for the community to work together to return civility to the campus after weeks of unrest.

“These past two weeks have been among the most difficult in Columbia’s history,” Dr. Shafik said. “The turmoil and tension, division and disruption have impacted the entire community.”

Speaking directly to the students, Dr. Shafik highlighted the fact that many seniors are now spending their final days in college the way they began in 2020 — online.

“No matter where you stand on any issue, Columbia should be a community that feels welcoming and safe for everyone,” she said.

In the video, Dr. Shafik said that her administration tried “very hard to resolve” the issue of the encampment through dialogue and discussion with the student protesters, but that, ultimately, they could not reach an agreement.

When a group of protesters broke into and occupied Hamilton Hall, Dr. Shafik said, it “crossed a new line,” and put students at risk.

Despite the turmoil of the last few weeks and months, Dr. Shafik told the Columbia community that she has confidence in the future.

“During the listening sessions I held with many students in recent months, I’ve been heartened by your intelligence, thoughtfulness and kindness,” she said.

“Every one of us has a role to play in bringing back the values of truth and civil discourse that polarization has severely damaged,” she added. “Here at Columbia, parallel realities and parallel conversations have walled us off from other perspectives. Working together, I know we can break down these barriers.”

In a break from what the Columbia community may be used to from Dr. Shafik, she also shared personal anecdotes about her upbringing in the video.

“As many of you know, I was born in the Middle East. I grew up in a Muslim family, with many Christian and Jewish friends,” she said. “I spent two decades working in international organizations with people from every nationality and religion in the world where if you can’t bridge divides and see each other’s point of view, you can’t get anything done.”

Dr. Shafik said that she learned from that experience, that “people can disagree and still make progress.”

The issues that are challenging us, she said, namely “the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, antisemitism, and anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias” have existed for a long time, she said, adding that Columbia University cannot solve them single-handedly.

“What we can do is be an exemplar of a better world where people who disagree do so civilly, recognize each other’s humanity, and show empathy and compassion for one another,” she said. “We have a lot to do, but I am committed to working at it, every day and with each of you, to rebuild community on our campus.”

Earlier on Friday, more than 700 Columbia University community members attended an online meeting of the university’s Senate, a policymaking body made up of faculty members, students and others.

During the meeting, many expressed a lack of confidence in university leadership. Eventually, the chat was shut down because of arguing.

Jeanine D’Armiento, chair of the Senate, said in the meeting that the group’s executive committee had recommended the university continue negotiations with students instead of calling in the police on Tuesday. But, she said, “We were not asked for our opinion.”

4c1e6c2d50,National Review,Biden’s Favorite Cable Host Joe Scarborough Urges President to ‘Do the Right Thing’ as Pressure to Withdraw Mounts - National Review,"MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough went on a lengthy tirade on Thursday morning urging President Joe Biden’s closest allies to help him “do the right thing,” indicating he should drop out of the presidential race without explicitly calling for it.

“This is not going to end well if it continues to drag out,” Scarborough said Thursday on Morning Joe, referencing the president’s debate flop and the steady stream of Democrats who have since come out publicly to call on him to withdraw from the ticket.

Biden is known to watch the Morning Joe show daily and often speaks with Scarborough about current political issues and media coverage. Scarborough has been a staunch defender of Biden throughout his presidency, but has since turned on the 81-year-old commander-in-chief following his poor debate performance against former president Donald Trump late last month.

“It’s really incumbent on people that are around Joe Biden to step up at this point and help the president and help the man they love and do the right thing,” Scarborough said. He added that some in Biden’s orbit are keeping him in the race for financial reasons.

“The anger I hear are at the people that are keeping him in a bubble or who may have their own interests, some financial, in keeping him in the race. That is the real anger,” Scarborough continued. “It is widespread. Joe Biden deserves better. He deserves better than he is getting from those closest to him.”

The cable-television host said members of Congress are concerned they are going to lose the House and Senate in November, noting that Biden’s polling numbers are plummeting in swing states and his funding from Democratic donors is drying up.

Intraparty pressure for Biden’s withdrawal continues to mount, with at least 20 Hill Democrats publicly calling on him to step aside and allowing a different candidate to take his spot on the party’s ticket. Representative Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) was the latest lawmaker to do so.

Additionally, some top Democrats have been privately telling Biden that he’ll lose to Trump in November if he continues running for a second term.

Representative Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), the former House speaker, said current polling indicates Democrats will lose the White House and fail to retake the House if Biden becomes the nominee in the coming weeks, four sources briefed on the phone call told CNN. Biden responded defensively, saying he has seen polls that show otherwise. Pelosi did not call for his withdrawal in the private conversation.

Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.) have also recently spoken with Biden about his viability. Schumer met directly with Biden on Saturday — the day of the failed assassination attempt on Trump — to tell him it would be best for the Democratic Party if he dropped out of the race. Jeffries privately suggested the same last week.

Despite the urgent pleas, the White House maintains he will stay in the race: “The president told both leaders he is the nominee of the party, he plans to win, and looks forward to working with both of them to pass his 100 days agenda to help working families.”

Pelosi, Schumer, nor Jeffries have yet made a public statement telling Biden to bow out. That could change in the coming days, as several top Democrats plan to persuade him to withdraw as soon as this weekend, Axios reported.

“His choice is to be one of history’s heroes, or to be sure of the fact that there’ll never be a Biden presidential library,” a close friend to the president told the outlet. “I pray that he does the right thing. He’s headed that way.”

6eb145ce63,The Associated Press,Goaltender interference debate is alive and well in the NHL playoffs after 1st-round controversy - The Associated Press,"Minutes after his team was knocked out of the NHL playoffs in a game that included two disallowed goals because of goaltender interference, Jon Cooper was careful to say those calls weren’t the reason the Tampa Bay Lightning lost the series. He still had a problem with them.

Cooper, a two-time Stanley Cup-winning coach, pointed out the league has made one rule change after another to encourage offense. When Tampa Bay scored its first goal, Florida coach Paul Maurice successfully challenged to wipe it out for goalie interference; when on-ice officials ruled a later Lightning goal should not count for the same reason, Cooper challenged but the call was upheld. His team went on to lose 6-1 and he said afterward he didn’t think there was enough evidence for either call.

It was clear this was the biggest controversy of the postseason so far.

At least one prominent colleague agreed with Cooper’s sentiment, and many of the coaches left in the playoffs acknowledge there’s a delicate balance when it comes to goalie interference, when the decision or a coach’s challenge can swing a game or a series at the most important time of year.

“It’s an area they’re going to have to look at to shore up,” said Carolina’s Rod Brind’Amour, who sided with Cooper on the premise about goalies being overprotected for incidental contact. “We we want to see goals, especially those ones when you’re fighting around the net. If you knock a goalie over, that’s goalie interference. But there should be a little more onus on just the common sense part of it.”

After his Panthers were on the positive end of all three goalie interference challenges so far, Maurice felt he could be more philosophical about the topic than if he were in Cooper’s chair. The veteran coach who guided Florida to the Stanley Cup Final last year felt confident enough to challenge but wasn’t entirely sure what the league’s situation room would decide.

Still, he thinks goalie interference is clearer now than it was four or five years ago because the pendulum has swung from zero tolerance to more contact and settled in the middle.

“They’ve tried to narrow it,” Maurice said. “If the goaltender can’t get to the save, it’s goalie interference. So, what I do (behind the bench) on that is truly ‘spirit of the rule.’ I try not to factor in all the things that are criteria that they tell you. Is (an opponent) in his crease to stop him from making a save I think he can save? It’s almost that simple.”

What takes some of simplicity out of the process is the punishment: a 2-minute delay-of-game penalty for any unsuccessful challenge, either for goaltender interference or offside. Challenging for offside is usually more clear since it is based on video coaches watch closely; rarely do they get it wrong.

Goalie interference has become something like the definition of a catch in football, a moving target. As such, the calculus that goes into challenging it is on a coach-by-coach, case-by-case basis.

“Time and score has something to do with it, the way your team plays has something to do with it,” said Colorado’s Jared Bednar, who led the Avalanche to the Cup in 2022. “The reality of the situation often is you better be sure it’s goalie interference, if you’re going to challenge it. If it’s questionable, then you’re likely not getting the call and sometimes when you’re sure, you don’t get the call. People that say they have it figured out, I would argue and disagree because we don’t.”

Bednar added that if there was a poll of NHL coaches, he thinks it would show the league hasn’t yet established a clear standard. That gray area is what drives coaches crazy.

Cooper credited Sergei Bobrovsky for duping officials to sell the calls and lamented how two skaters engaging in a net-front battle can be responsible for disallowing goals. Maurice pointed to a potential goalie interference situation in the Nashville-Vancouver series as interesting because of contact within the crease.

Brind’Amour echoed Cooper’s use of the word “egregious” as a key need for evidence to reverse a call on the ice. And no one knows when the next time goalie interference will play a key role in a playoff game this spring.

“The puck’s by the goalie on some of these and you get hit and then it’s still — like, it’s a judgment call — and so it’s somebody’s opinion and my opinion and your opinion might be different on these,” Brind’Amour said. “That’s why this whole thing is tough because it does come down to opinions.”

Michelle Obama abandons her own plea to ‘go high’

The former first lady’s political outlook has changed in the face of the former president’s third presidential run.

3 weeks ago

The Obamas brought the crowd to new heights

Their speeches, full of nostalgia and tough love, sounded slightly different from years past.

On Day Two of the Democratic National Convention, Michelle and Barack Obama sent an already charged-up crowd into pure euphoria.

The former president and his wife, still two of the most popular figures in the Democratic Party, have long been known as powerful orators. But their speeches tonight sounded slightly different from years past.

Michelle Obama — famous for her “when they go low, we go high” refrain that was repeated throughout the 2016 campaign — continued to appeal to Democrats’ better angels, telling the crowd “going small is never the answer.” But she also attacked Trump directly and garnered potentially the biggest applause line of the night when she said, “Someone might want to tell [Trump] that the job he’s currently seeking is one of those ‘Black jobs.’”

She gave the crowd some tough love as well, telling the audience in the convention hall and watching on screens around the country that “this is going to be an uphill battle.”

And she insisted that “we cannot get a Goldilocks complex about whether everything is juuust right.” That statement, which got a thunderous round of applause, also served as a not-so-subtle dig at some people who are unwilling to vote for a Democratic ticket that they feel hasn’t lived up to their policy expectations, particularly on the war in Gaza.

Her husband piled on, noting in his speech, “It won’t be easy. The other side knows it’s easier to play on people’s fears and cynicism.”

When Barack Obama walked out to “City of Blinding Lights” by U2, it was the first time that he had appeared and spoken directly to the public since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race.

His speech in many ways summed up the energy of the convention and the arc of most speakers’ remarks: First, thank Biden — noting he put his own ambition aside for the good of the country, a rare thing in politics — then turn to a litany of grievances against Trump and a positive case for why Harris should be elected. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) did this as he delivered the progressive case for voting for the vice president. So did Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who struck a very different note from the Vermont senator when he proudly announced that his status as a billionaire gives him the credentials to say, “Trump is rich in only one thing: stupidity.”

The 44th president also referred to the 2004 speech that made him a national star, setting it in the context of 2024. “I know these ideas can feel pretty naive right now. … We chase the approval of strangers on our phones; we build all manner of walls and fences around ourselves and then wonder why we feel so alone. We don’t trust each other as much because we don’t take the time to know each other.”

Still, Obama insisted that the ideas he espoused 20 years ago remain the basis for his political philosophy. “We still coach Little League and look out for our elderly neighbors,” he said, “because the vast majority of us don’t want to live in a country that’s bitter and divided. We want something better. We want to be better.”

It’s a concept rarely articulated in modern national politics. But at least within the convention hall, it was met with shouts of nostalgia-tinged appreciation and waves of cheers.

And unlike a dragging convention on Monday evening, all the speakers managed to get their lines in with enough time for delegates to get at least a couple of hours of sleep before they arrive for delegation breakfasts on Wednesday morning to do it all over again. We’ll be right there with them.

Delegates leaving the convention center at the end of Night Two have been in a much better mood, given the improvements to the logistics. The night’s programming ended relatively on time. And better yet for some, the shuttle buses to their hotels appeared to be running more smoothly with much shorter lines to board.

Here are the best zingers from Michelle and Barack Obama's convention speeches

Yes, Barack Obama made a ""crowd"" size joke, referencing Donald Trump.

The Obamas returned to the center of Democratic politics with back-to-back speeches at the convention Tuesday night about the stakes in this election — and some zingers for the friendly crowd.

As Michelle Obama critiqued Donald Trump and the risk he poses to the country, she also took a jab at his business record.

“We will never benefit from the affirmative action of generational wealth,” she said. “If we bankrupt a business, or choke in a crisis, we don’t get a second, third, or fourth chance.”

The convention hall burst into laughter and soon after she followed up with another poke at the former president.

""Who’s going to tell him that the job he’s currently seeking might just be one of those 'Black jobs'?"" the former first Lady asked.

The 44th president was equally creative with his comparisons.

Barack Obama reminded the crowd of Trump’s “weird obsession with crowd size” to a big laugh from the audience — a reference to numerous instances of Trump fixating on how many people attend his and his opponents' events.

He even poked fun at his own presidential legacy when talking about health care coverage and the Affordable Care Act, which he signed into law.

“I noticed by the way, since it became popular, they don’t call it Obamacare no more,” the former president said, scratching behind his ear for effect.

And when talking about the failed immigration and border reform bill on Capitol Hill, he seized the moment to stop the crowd from booing to revive an old tease targeting the audience, saying “don’t boo, vote.”

Former President Barack Obama spent much of his Tuesday remarks talking up the reasons Kamala Harris should win. But he did take a moment to remind Democrats gathered in the United Center about his signature domestic achievement: the Affordable Care Act.

He quipped that it has become enormously popular since the immediate days after its passage.

“We should all be proud of the enormous progress that we've made through the Affordable Care Act providing millions of people access to affordable coverage, protecting millions more from unscrupulous insurance practices and notice,” Obama said.

Then he pointed out it's no longer referred to by its old nickname: “I’ve noticed, by the way, that since it's become popular, they don't call it Obamacare no more.”

Republican DNC speakers try to prove Harris’ appeal across the aisle

“I feel a little out of place tonight, but I feel more at home here than in today’s Republican Party,” one border city Republican mayor said.

Four Republican speakers took the stage on the second night of the DNC to demonstrate that Kamala Harris can win the anti-Trump, moderate GOP vote.

A former Trump voter, a border-city mayor and a former Trump White House official all said their vote in November might not reflect their personal political convictions, but who they believe is a stronger leader and American patriot. Their pitch to their fellow anti-Trump Republicans was consistent: Country over party.

“I have a confession to make. I’m a lifelong Republican,” Mesa, Arizona, Mayor John Giles said during his prime-time speaking slot. “I feel a little out of place tonight, but I feel more at home here than in today’s Republican Party.”

Stephanie Grisham, who was communications director and press secretary for Donald Trump before resigning in response to the Jan. 6 insurrection, echoed Giles’ warnings of a party that she said had become unrecognizable under Trump.

Grisham was particularly searing in her criticism, saying that Trump mocked his supporters behind closed doors. She spoke immediately after one of those supporters, construction worker Kyle Sweetser, explained why he couldn’t bring himself to vote for Trump this year.

“Now I’m not left-wing, period — but I believe our leaders should bring out the best in us, not the worst,” Sweetser said. “I’m voting for Kamala Harris because she’ll make us proud to be American again.”

The messaging among Republicans didn’t seem designed to draw support from Trump’s base — this is the DNC, after all. But the Republican speakers were eager to portray Harris as a choice of patriotism over partisanship and focused their remarks more on the vice president’s personal traits than her policies.

“We cannot elect a president who does not like dogs or hangs around with people who shoot them,” Ana Navarro said, referencing South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem.

In her remarks at the DNC, Michelle Obama made a forceful case against former President Donald Trump, calling him unfit for office.

“For years, Donald Trump did everything in his power to try to make people fear us,” Obama said, while talking about his limited world view and skewed perception of the Black experience. She then hit him on a remark Trump repeatedly goes to as he is trying to endear himself to Black voters.

“Who’s going to tell him that the job he’s currently seeking might just be one of those “Black jobs”?

She went on to defend LGBTQ+ rights in the face of Republican attempts curb them: “Demonizing our children for being who they are and loving who they love—that doesn’t make anybody’s life better,” she said, saying it only makes someone ""seem small.""

“Going small is petty… it’s unhealthy… and quite frankly, it’s unpresidential shown her allegiance to this nation, not by spewing anger and bitterness, but by living a life of service,” she said.

Angela Alsobrooks shares stories about Kamala Harris, her longtime mentor

The Maryland Senate candidate hopes to join Harris as one of just a handful of Black women to have served in the U.S. Senate.

Maryland Senate candidate Angela Alsobrooks used her prime time speaking slot to share stories of her personal relationship with Vice President Kamala Harris, whom she’s known for 14 years and calls a “friend, mentor and role model.”

Alsobrooks said she first heard of Harris in 2009 from a profile in Essence magazine on Harris’ novel criminal justice program in California. At the time, Alsobrooks was running for state's attorney of Prince George’s County.

“After reading about this super bad district attorney, I talked non-stop about her on the campaign trail,” Alsobrooks said.

Two days after her victory, she said, Harris called her to offer support for her new role.

Only three Black women have ever served in the U.S. Senate. (Harris was the second.) Alsobrooks hopes to defeat popular former Gov. Larry Hogan in November to join that small club. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.), is all but guaranteed to do so in deep-blue Delaware.

Michelle Lujan Grisham boosts Kamala Harris’ record on health care

The Republicans, the New Mexico governor said, “want to dismantle our health care system.”

New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham knows health care. She's a former state health secretary, after all, whose name was once floated as a potential Health and Human Services secretary under Joe Biden.

Now, she's using her credentials to boost Vice President Kamala Harris' profile on health care issues.

Lujan Grisham said on the convention floor Tuesday evening that Harris took on drug companies that ""jacked up prices"" and hospitals that ""overcharged patients,"" voted ""hell no"" on repealing the Affordable Care Act and cast the tie-breaking vote on legislation that capped insulin costs at $35 for Medicare beneficiaries.

By contrast, she said former President Donald Trump and his running mate Sen. JD Vance ""want to dismantle our health care system, repeal the Affordable Care act, and eliminate protections for preexisting conditions.""

""Either these guys don't get it, or they just don't care,"" Lujan Grisham, who is also a former member of Congress, said.

In 2017, Trump and Congressional Republicans unsuccessfully tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's sweeping health care reform legislation. Trump now says he doesn't want to repeal the ACA but rather make the law ""much better"" — without offering specifics.

“Kamala Harris believes in growing the economic ties for the benefit of current and future generations. Unlike her opponent, she knows the way not to build an advanced economy is a broad tariff that would only raise prices, hurt consumers and businesses and cost jobs.”

He added, “She knows the way not to do it is to give people like me a tax cut, when that money should be invested to grow the middle class.”

JB Pritzker: 'Take it from an actual billionaire, Trump is rich in only one thing: stupidity'

The Illinois governor and heir to the Hyatt Hotels fortune poked fun at Trump in his convention speech.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker pitched his administrative successes, took digs at Donald Trump and gave a shout-out to Illinois’ “presidential pedigree,” in a classic convention speech that celebrated Kamala Harris, who spent part of her youth in the state.

“We claim her, too,” Pritzker said after ticking off Abraham Lincoln (though a Republican) and Barack Obama as other presidents from Illinois.

In one of the biggest applause lines, Pritzker poked fun at Trump.

“Donald Trump thinks we should trust him on the economy because he claims to be very rich,” said Pritzker, an heir to the Hyatt Hotels fortune. “Take it from an actual billionaire, Trump is rich in only one thing: stupidity.”

In his pivot to Harris, Pritzker said, “It’s time we stop expecting women to clean up messes without the authority and the title to match the job. Vice President was a good title for Kamala Harris. You know an even better one? President.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders makes the progressive case to elect Kamala Harris

“When the political will is there, government can effectively deliver for the people of our country,” the two-time presidential candidate said.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) made a forceful progressive case to keep building on the work of the Biden administration — an administration that’s “accomplished more than any government since FDR” — by electing Kamala Harris this fall.

The Vermont Independent and two-time presidential candidate returned to familiar themes critiquing the influence of money in politics, income inequality and the lack of guaranteed health care during his 12-minute speech Tuesday night.

“When the political will is there, government can effectively deliver for the people of our country,” Sanders said. “And now we need to summon that will again, because too many of our fellow Americans are struggling every day to just get by.”

He continued: “I look forward to working with Kamala and [Vice Presidential nominee] Tim [Walz] to pass this agenda,” later adding that it was “not a radical agenda.”

Sanders also joined fellow progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in bringing up the Israel-Hamas conflict during his remarks. He said the U.S. should “end this horrific war in Gaza, bring home the hostages and demand an immediate ceasefire,"" receiving raucous applause inside the Chicago convention venue.

“On November 5th, let us elect Kamala Harris as our president,” Sanders, who’s seeking a fourth Senate term this fall, closed. “And let us go forward to create the nation we know we can become.”

Meanwhile, in Milwaukee: Kamala Harris hits Trump on abortion

The Democratic presidential nominee is rallying with Tim Walz in Wisconsin tonight.

Kamala Harris seized on Donald Trump’s answer in a recent CBS interview, during which he was asked whether he had regrets about the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade.

“Just yesterday, when he was asked if he has any regrets about ending Roe v. Wade, Donald Trump, Donald Trump — without even a moment’s hesitation, you would think he would reflect on it for at least a second — said no. No regrets,” Harris said, speaking at her rally in Milwaukee.

“I do believe that bad behavior should result in a consequence. Now we will make sure he does face a consequence, and that’ll be at the ballot box in November,"" she said.

Abortion has shown to be a winning issue for the party. Harris has long been a leading voice on reproductive rights for Democrats, and the party has filled this week’s convention with reminders of the election’s stakes two years after the Dobbs decision rocked the country.

Vice President Kamala Harris ""has been the best partner Senate Democrats could ever have asked for,"" the Senate majority leader said.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer rallied Democrats around Kamala Harris’ presidential bid and made a bold prediction his party would retain — and expand — its majority control of the chamber.

""Vice President Harris has been the best partner Senate Democrats could ever have asked for,"" the New York Democrat said.

And Schumer reiterated a prediction he’s been increasingly bullish about in recent days: “We’re going to hold the Senate again, and we’re poised to pick up seats.”

He shouted out each of the endangered Democratic incumbents by name: Sens. Jon Tester (Mont.), Jacky Rosen (Nev.), Tammy Baldwin (Wis.), Sherrod Brown (Ohio), Bob Casey (Pa.) — and also included Sen. Martin Heinrich (N.M.).

And he touted the party’s nominees in a number of open or Republican-held seats: Ruben Gallego in Arizona, Colin Allred in Texas, Elissa Slotkin in Michigan, Angela Alsobrooks in Maryland, Andy Kim in New Jersey, Lisa Blunt Rochester in Delaware and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell in Florida.

Kate Cox, the Texas woman who came to national prominence after she sued her state at 20 weeks pregnant seeking an emergency abortion, helped cast the state's votes for Vice President Kamala Harris.

Cox ultimately had to leave Texas to have an abortion in New Mexico, where the procedure is legal.

""If I didn't get an abortion, it would put a future pregnancy at risk. But Trump didn't care, and because of his abortion bans I had to flee my home,"" Cox said from the convention floor.

New Hampshire makes sure to note when casting its delegate votes for Harris that it’s home of the first-in-the-nation presidential primary. But the DNC threatened to withhold its votes at the convention over that very first-in-the-nation status.

That's because President Joe Biden wanted South Carolina to hold the first nominating contest this year — a nod to the importance of Black voters to the Democratic party base and to the fact that it swung Biden's presidential fortunes in 2020. But the state didn't change its law mandating that it hold the nation's first primary, and after Biden's allies staged a write-in campaign that he won overwhelmingly, the DNC agreed to seat the delegates.

Of course, a lot has changed since then. And the string of rising Democratic Party stars visiting the state’s delegate breakfast this week proves its continued importance in the party’s presidential nominating process.

Polis wants a Harris win but doesn’t agree with everything

Colorado governor says he'll be “doing everything I can to elect Kamala Harris.""

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis is “doing everything I can to elect Kamala Harris” — but that doesn’t mean they agree on everything.

Polis, a Democrat who has worked to cut taxes for businesses and individuals in his state, suggested Harris’ economic policies were a bit too progressive in his view.

“Would I like to see more competitive pro-growth economic policy? Of course,” he said during an interview at the CNN-POLITICO Grill. “But keep in mind, while the president’s viewpoint matters, just as perhaps a governor’s does, frankly, legislatures matter even more.”

Polis also said he hoped President Joe Biden “had led more on trade” — though he said the president’s was far better than Republican trade policy, which he called “regressive” and said “destroys American jobs” because of retaliatory tariffs.

The Colorado governor won his state by nearly 20 points in 2022 and previously served a decade in the House. He’s been seen as a member of the deep Democratic bench of political talent that wouldn’t be able to launch a presidential bid until 2028 at the earliest, and was even floated as an early candidate in Harris’ veepstakes.

But asked how that affected his role as a “rising star” in the party, Polis stayed on message, saying: “I’m excited that we have a presidential nominee that we hope will serve two terms.”

Kamala Harris would aim for ‘balance’ in AI policy, adviser says

The U.S. should lead global AI competition *and* protect grandmothers from fake calls, said Tony West.

Vice President Kamala Harris’ approach to artificial intelligence would balance the U.S.'s desire to outcompete other countries with the need to protect people from deepfakes and other harmful uses of the technology, a key adviser said Tuesday.

“She has always come at this issue from the conviction that the United States has to maintain its global competitiveness when it comes to AI and other emerging technologies,” said Harris’ brother-in-law Tony West, who has been helping her campaign.

But the technology’s potential to create fake images and audio that can then be used to deceive and defraud people must also be addressed, he continued, saying it’s a top concern for Harris as a former prosecutor and state attorney general.

“She's concerned about these calls that your grandmother might be getting where a person sounds like you, but it's not you, and anybody can pick up an app and basically create these kinds of deepfakes,” West said. “She wants to make sure that we're paying attention to how we prevent that and how we protect consumers.”

His remarks came Tuesday at an event co-hosted by eight tech industry associations on the sidelines of the Democratic National Convention. West recently took leave from his job as chief legal officer at Uber to assist the campaign. He is married to Harris’ sister, Maya Harris.

Some in Silicon Valley are hopeful that a Harris administration would amount to a “reset” in Washington after years of intense scrutiny, anticipating that her years of working with the tech industry as California’s attorney general and senator could make her more of an ally than President Joe Biden.

“Being from San Francisco, she's very familiar with tech and its involvement in our global competitiveness, so we appreciate that,” Linda Moore, the CEO of trade association TechNet, told West. “Though she doesn't hesitate to call out the tech sector when they could be doing better.”

“One of the things you can say about her is that she's firm and fair,” West responded. “If accountability needs to be had, she will not hesitate to hold companies or individuals accountable.”

“That's true for her family, too,” he quipped.

Lobbyists scramble to understand how Kamala Harris would change Washington

They’re trying to meet her inner circle while in Chicago this week.

Lobbyists flock to conventions every four years to network, advocate for their clients and companies and prepare for the new administration. This year’s DNC is no different — but the shocking change at the top of the ticket has them scrambling to meet Kamala Harris' inner circle and understand how she would change Washington.

Influence peddlers in Chicago see some policy opportunities for their pet causes in the switch-up if Harris wins in November. But they also expect things to generally “be very similar” to how the Biden administration has operated, one lobbyist said.

But since the Biden-to-Harris shift was so sudden, when one transportation lobbyist was asked whether they had zeroed in on who on Harris’ team was responsible for their issues, the lobbyist conceded, “I don’t think we’ve gotten that far yet.”

Several lobbying firms have been hosting events in Chicago amid the DNC. At a party hosted by law and lobbying firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck at a swanky restaurant — where steak kebabs and arancini balls were passed out — some attendees were waiting in line to speak to Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.). Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) and Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) also made appearances.

At the party, one cannabis lobbyist was optimistic about how Harris would help his industry — even if cannabis reform isn't addressed in the Democratic platform.

“She’s been a big champion of the administration’s process of reclassifying cannabis,” said Adam Goers, SVP of corporate affairs at The Cannabist Company. “In her own term, we hope she’s going to take the next step and legalize, which Biden would not have done.”

Rep. Pete Aguilar: The enthusiasm for Harris ‘absolutely translates’ to down-ballot races

“I think it has invigorated our communities in those battleground districts,” he said.

House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar joined the growing number in his party crowing about the enthusiasm Vice President Kamala Harris has brought to down-ballot races.

“The energy and the excitement that we are seeing absolutely translates,” he said in a conversation with POLITICO. “I think it has invigorated our communities in those battleground districts, and that’s our path to 218 in the House.”

Aguilar also predicted Democrats would not shy away from public safety attacks as they attempt to flip the script on what’s become a potent GOP attack line over the past few cycles. Democrats, he said, should remind voters that Republicans are the ones who want to defund DOJ and the FBI.

On a lighter note: In discussing his work on the Jan. 6 committee, he said he thinks “the world of” former Reps. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) and Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), with whom he served. Cheney sent her former colleague her book and Aguilar said that the committee keeps in touch via group chat.

‘Veep’ star Julia Louis-Dreyfus makes a surprise appearance at climate event

Julia Louis-Dreyfus fires up the room at an environment event, calling Donald Trump “the worst climate president in U.S. history.”

Julia Louis-Dreyfus, the star of ""Seinfeld"" and ""Veep"" and an avowed climate activist, made a surprise guest appearance at the environmental movement’s marquee celebration at the Democratic National Convention.

“Everybody here in this room knows the climate is the sneaky issue that is tied to every other issue,” she said to a packed room at the “Climate Voters Go All In” event, hosted by the League of Conservation Voters, Climate Power and the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund.

“Climate is an economic issue, it’s a social justice issue, it’s an immigration issue, it’s an energy issue and it’s a national security issue,” Louis-Dreyfus continued. “It’s complicated; it takes some incredible leadership. It’s going to take hard work, and we have a binary choice: We can elect a brilliant leader who has been a driving force in the strongest presidential administration on climate in U.S. history and is ready to build on that — or we can elect a pathetic reality TV host who was the worst climate president in U.S. history and plans to be even worse this time around.”

Her remarks in support of Vice President Kamala Harris — and scathing comments about former President Donald Trump delivered with biting humor — fired up the room of climate VIPs, with EPA Administrator Michael Regan in the audience alongside nearly a dozen members of the House and Senate who work on environmental issues.

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who Louis-Dreyfus introduced, followed earlier remarks from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Rep. Andy Kim (D-N.J.), who is poised to win a Senate seat in November.

They all struck a more sober tone about the stakes of the planet if Trump wins reelection, citing the Project 2025 playbook and the Republican ticket’s repeated promises to roll back environmental regulations and clean energy tax credits codified as part of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Buttigieg cautioned that it’s not just the IRA’s survival that depends on a Harris victory but its longevity and sustaining power.

“The Inflation Reduction Act represented the most significant climate legislation undertaken by any country in the history of human civilization, but our message on this cannot be, ‘OK, we did the big climate bill, everyone should love us. Mission accomplished, we’re gonna go home now,’” he said.

Democrats are ordered to keep speeches short and on time

Things went too long Monday. Democrats are trying to make sure their speeches are short and on time tonight.

Top Democrats scrambled Tuesday to trim the length of key speeches after widespread complaints about Monday night's long lineup of programming pushing Joe Biden past prime time.

Stephanie Cutter, a former Obama adviser who joined the Kamala Harris campaign as a senior adviser, has been phoning Democrats throughout the day to shorten their scripts and stress that tonight’s speeches remain on time, according to two people familiar with the discussions.

Democrats’ first day of speeches ended up hours behind schedule, forcing officials to cut several speakers entirely. That included House members like Grace Meng of New York and Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.

DNC officials blamed the delays on “raucous applause” Monday.

Why Kamala Harris isn’t at the DNC tonight

She’s headlining a campaign rally in Wisconsin — a state Democrats need to win in November.

It’s not every election year that party nominees counter-program their own convention. But that’s what Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will do tonight with a jam-packed rally in Milwaukee.

It speaks to how crucial the battleground state will be for Democrats come November. The party is still haunted by 2016, when Hillary Clinton skipped campaigning in the state. And it’s not like Joe Biden swept the battleground in 2020 — he won by just 20,000 votes.

If one thing is clear, the Harris campaign isn’t sleeping on Wisconsin this cycle. Tonight marks Harris’ seventh trip to the state this year — and her third since launching her campaign last month.

It was convenient for Harris and Walz to make the quick trip from Chicago, but it also underscores how little time they have to sell their ticket in swing states across the country. Instead of spending the full week in the windy city, they opted for a primetime rally before thousands of supporters in Fiserv Forum — the same venue Donald Trump and GOP party officials filled for last month's RNC.

Rep. Jim Himes: 'There's a national security reason' why Democrats should win in 2024

“Donald Trump, amongst his many attributes, has this bizarre, magnetic attraction to autocrats.”

Rep. Jim Himes (D-Ct.), ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, warned a second Donald Trump presidency would likely see the U.S. abandon European allies, end support for Ukraine and take additional actions that would hearten dictators around the world.

“There's a national security reason to want the Democrats to win and that national security reason is that a Donald Trump presidency is a presidency in which we probably walk away from our commitment to our allies,” Himes said during a conversation with POLITICO. “Donald Trump, amongst his many attributes, has this bizarre, magnetic attraction to autocrats.”

Himes said U.S. citizens had reasons to continue to fear election security throughout the rest of the year on the heels of the hack of the Trump campaign by Iran.

“Don’t ever get complacent,” he said. “I am confident that [those in the intelligence community] are very, very good at this. I'm also confident that there's always a threat that you don't see coming around the corner.”

He cautioned against underestimating Ukraine, which Himes argued has continued to defy expectations about how the country handles the ongoing conflict with Russia.

“We need to be humble about what the Ukrainians are capable of doing and support them more fervently than we have,” he said.

The Connecticut Democrat also said the convention was “radically different” with Harris as the presumptive nominee than it would have been under President Joe Biden.

But he said beyond the newfound optimism and enthusiasm among his party, Democrats have a compelling story to tell the American people through actions like cutting the price of prescription drugs and massive infrastructure investments.

“It really matters to people even if it’s in this sort of very social media, vibey influencer world,” Himes said.

Jack Schlossberg invokes his grandfather in DNC speech

The Vogue political correspondent and internet “it boy” is one of DNC's many influencers.

Jack Schlossberg — the Vogue political correspondent and internet “it boy” — took to the stage to compare Vice President Kamala Harris to his grandfather, President John F. Kennedy.

“Like President Kennedy, Vice President Harris has dedicated her life to public service. She believes in America like my grandfather did, that we do things not because they are easy, but because they are hard,” said Schlossberg, 31, a self-described “silly goose” whose TikToks mocking Sen. JD Vance have gone viral in recent weeks.

Schlossberg’s speaking slot is indicative of the DNC’s broader push this week to connect to Gen-Z voters. The convention has credentialed over 200 other content creators to capture the event, and influencer Nabela Noor — who has over 7.5 million followers on TikTok — is set to speak later tonight.

CORRECTION: A previous version of this report misstated who Jack Schlossberg's grandfather is. It is John F. Kennedy.

What would a Harris administration foreign policy look like? These diplomats want to know.

They’re still watching to see how a Harris White House could put its own spin on multilateral partnerships.

Prominent members of the Washington diplomatic corps said Tuesday that they don’t expect a Kamala Harris presidency will differ much from the Biden administration when it comes to U.S. support for Ukraine and U.S. engagement with transatlantic allies.

But they’re still watching to see how a Harris administration could put its own spin on multilateral engagements and partnerships as it builds on efforts made under Joe Biden.

""We certainly do expect a great deal of continuity there,” Estonian Ambassador Kristjan Prikk said in conversation with POLITICO. Yet he noted that his country wants to see a Harris administration provide “clear signals and clear understanding of their views, including the issues that they want to keep, keep the way that they are, and some changes, too.”

Canadian Ambassador Kirsten Hillman said that while her country also expects continuity, she noted that Harris has different experiences and priorities that will inform her foreign policy, pointing to her personal focus on tech issues and her work on hemispheric security issues and migration. That different perspective, she added, could provide new opportunities for bilateral cooperation as Washington and Ottawa deepen existing ties.

“There's crossover there, I think, in defense and security and new technologies and maintaining leadership and global sort of governance around some technologies that offer enormous opportunities but also pose important risks, including national security risks,” Hillman said. “I think that would be another, another issue that we're looking for.”

U.S. allies have telegraphed their anxieties over the possible return of Donald Trump to the White House and the effects a second Trump presidency could have on U.S. support for Ukraine and U.S. engagement in NATO and the Indo-Pacific. And Harris’ relationships with key world leaders and U.S. partners have received scrutiny since her ascension to the top of the Democratic ticket, as foreign policy hands scour for clues in call logs and readouts about how a Harris presidency could approach U.S. engagements around the world differently.

At least one envoy praised Harris’ hospitality as vice president.

British Ambassador Karen Pierce, whose official residence is located steps away from the Naval Observatory where Harris and Doug Emhoff live, called Harris and Emhoff “very nice neighbors.”

“They very kindly invited my husband and me to their 50 years of hip-hop party. I am very sorry to say we were totally out of place, but we had a great time,” Pierce said. “We've seen the second gentleman quite a few times, and when the vice president moved in, the New Zealand ambassador and I went over with welcome gifts. So we've been really honored to be that close.”

Pierce, though, demurred when asked if her proximity to Harris afforded her any unique insights into the Democratic nominee’s foreign policy vision. “It's quite hard to talk about foreign policy during hip-hop — it doesn’t kind of lend itself to that discussion,” she quipped.

'Feral 25 year olds' are running Kamala Harris' social media — and it's working

It’s about being “aware of the meme without being the meme.”

For Vice President Kamala Harris deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty, it’s about being “aware of the meme without being the meme.”

In the immediate aftermath of Harris jumping into the race, President Joe Biden’s social media accounts quickly shifted to the vice president’s, with flicks to viral online trends like “Brat,” singer Charli XCX’s album, and coconut trees. It was a noticeable shift, especially going from a candidate whose age was a major point of contention to one who is energizing younger voters.

“The thing that we wanted to show was there are going to be some stylistic differences between the campaign before and the campaign now,” Flaherty, Biden’s former digital director, said during an interview at the CNN-POLITICO Grill. “And the thing we wanted to do also was, how do you sort of wink and nod at what's happening on the internet without ... making it like it's propaganda for the campaign or anything like that.”

Flaherty pointed to the “feral 25 year olds” who are behind the campaign’s social media, noting that they “drive the strategy because they’re native to the platform.” He also said that having people who have worked with Harris for a while and know her voice helps with the type of content they post.

Flaherty added that the campaign is building upon the strategy from 2020, when the Biden campaign relied on content creators and influencers. During the convention this week, influencers are getting speaking slots.

“The importance of creators has only grown over the last couple of years as people's media consumption environments get more personalized and as they seek out people who they trust,” Flaherty said.

With having a campaign that is so online, there also comes the risk of running into rampant misinformation and disinformation. He said that the team is focused on misinformation that “actually moves voters … because if it is not moving voters one way or another, it's not worth lifting up, because at that point you're just amplifying it yourself.”

When pushed on why young voters weren’t as excited about Biden as they are Harris, Flaherty said it’s “hard to know” what voter enthusiasm would have looked like if Biden was still on the ballot.

“Young voters are ... very excited about this ticket, but voters across the country are excited about this ticket, and that's because of the vice president, and that's because of Gov. [Tim] Walz,” he said.

Anita Dunn says there's no hard feelings about Biden getting kicked out of prime time

She said the late start to Biden’s remarks didn’t at all dampen the “emotional” reception he received Monday night.

Former senior Biden adviser Anita Dunn doesn’t have hard feelings about her old boss’ speech at the convention being kicked out of prime time due to programming delays.

“We haven’t run a live campaign since 2016, and clearly we may have forgotten a little about how to do it,” Dunn, who departed the White House in July to support Kamala Harris’ campaign on the Future Forward super PAC, said during a conversation with POLITICO. “It is what it is.”

In a subtle ding on convention organizers, Dunn praised the 2020 campaign for running “like clockwork” — but noted that the DNC has pledged to tighten up Tuesday night's roster of speakers.

And she said the late start to Biden’s remarks didn’t at all dampen the “emotional” reception he received Monday night. Dunn said it was especially satisfying to staffers who felt deprived from a Biden victory uproarious crowd in 2020 due to Covid, and the sustained reaction spoke to to the “enormous well of gratitude and affection and respect and admiration for the president.”

“Last night is not the last time they’re going to hear from Joe Biden,” she added. “I did like the speech, I thought it was very Joe Biden.”

Gov. JB Pritzker wants to bring the DNC back to Chicago again in 2028

The Illinois governor was instrumental in landing this week’s four-day political event .

Gov. JB Pritzker hinted Tuesday that Chicago could try to win the Democratic National Convention again in 2028 — and that he might run again for governor, too.

“When I looked back to see all the Democratic conventions that have taken place in Chicago, I did not know that three of the four conventions that Franklin Roosevelt was nominated at were in Chicago,” Pritzker said in conversation with POLITICO’s Jonathan Martin, adding that both of Adlai Stevenson's nominations occurred in Chicago, too.

“Those were all back-to-back conventions. I know there are local pressures, and they're going to say, ‘Oh, we're bidding on 2028, already,’ but it has happened. It hasn't happened in recent history,” said Pritzker. “Chicago's a great city to have a convention. I mean, want to bring every convention I possibly can to the city of Chicago.”

The Illinois governor was instrumental in landing this week’s four-day political event — the city's 26th political convention — and acknowledged that he pestered President Joe Biden repeatedly about Chicago being the best city for the event.

Pritzker, who was in the running to be Kamala Harris’ running mate, also repeated comments he made to local media that he loves his job as governor and isn’t committing to running again — but isn’t opposed to it, either.

Winning a third term might even make it easier to win a convention.

Trump ramps up his DNC counterprogramming by attacking Harris on immigration and crime

""Kamala Harris will deliver crime, chaos, destruction and death,"" he said.

Donald Trump, in the battleground state of Michigan for the second stop on a weeklong counterprogramming tour of the DNC, attacked Kamala Harris on two themes that he’ll likely focus on during the remaining months of the campaign: Crime and immigration.

While Democrats have been pushing a message of optimism and unity at their convention in Chicago, Trump painted the United States as crime-ridden and attacked Kamala Harris’ record as a “lawless Marxist” prosecutor in San Francisco and blamed her for allowing “hordes of illegal alien criminals to stampede into our country.”

“Kamala Harris will deliver crime, chaos, destruction and death and if she's allowed to be the President of the United States, you'll see levels of crime that you've never seen before,” Trump said while flanked by sheriffs in uniform. “Crime in America is out of control.”

Trump delivered his announcement during a campaign stop focused on “crime and safety” at the Livingston County Sheriff's Office in Howell, Michigan, a town about 60 miles north of Detroit. Despite a national decline in violent crime this year, Trump has made combating crime a top priority in his campaign and has focused on Harris’ time as a California prosecutor in order to paint her as lenient on criminals.

A report from the Major Cities Chiefs Association tracked data in 69 major U.S. cities and found a drop in violent crime, including homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault.

While Trump has led in polling on crime and safety, his advantage has narrowed since Harris entered the race a month ago. According to a recent ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll, Trump’s 7-point lead on the issue in July dropped to 3 points now. Trump said, however, that he believes more women like him because of his stance on crime and safety.

“They want to be safe. They don't want …people pouring into their borders,” Trump said of female voters. The latest New York Times/Siena College poll shows Harris has a 14-point lead over Trump with women, 55 percent to 41 percent. The former president, and Republicans generally, have struggled to attract suburban women in part because of the party’s position on restricting abortion since the conservative-leaning Supreme Court dismantled Roe vs. Wade. The former president has said he believed abortion should be left to states to decide, not the federal government.

Highlighting crimes committed by undocumented migrants has become a hallmark of Trump campaign rallies. In gruesome detail, Trump has described murders committed by migrants and MS-13 gang members, and on Tuesday told the story of a “previously-deported illegal alien monster” who was arrested for repeatedly sexually assaulting a child in Shelby Township, Michigan, and an illegal migrant in St. Joseph County, Michigan, who assaulted two little girls.

The first case he mentions likely refers to a 32-year-old undocumented migrant facing three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct while the second refers to a 25-year-old undocumented immigrant who is accused of sexually assaulting two young girls in a mobile home park in March.

Trump said he planned to “shut down” sanctuary cities — a controversial topic in Michigan, where there are five communities that are self-proclaimed sanctuary cities.

On Thursday, Trump is expected to make a visit to the Southern border to talk about immigration.

As Democrats rally in Chicago, Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, are holding campaign stops in battleground states where they focus on different policy themes and have conducted interviews as a way to draw attention away from Illinois.

Trump’s visit to Howell comes just one month after a white supremacist rally, and the Harris campaign accused the Republican nominee of picking the setting to stir racial tensions.

Harris-Walz Spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement, “today, Donald Trump refused to condemn white supremacists who marched in his name.”

“Instead, the 34-time convicted felon lied about crime, which skyrocketed on his watch, about policing, which he tried to defund, and about the January 6 insurrectionists who attacked police officers defending our Capitol at his behest,” she said.

Since launching her campaign, Harris has paid close attention to UAW, a powerful union headquartered in a critical battleground state. One of Harris’ first stops on the campaign trail was UAW Local 900's union hall in the Detroit area alongside Fain. Fain was also given a prime-time speaking slot at the convention Monday.

Teamsters president Sean O’Brien is awaiting an invite

O’Brien quips the invite was lost by U.S. Postal Service

Teamsters president Sean O’Brien, whose organization hasn’t endorsed a candidate, hasn’t been asked to speak at the DNC.

“I could take it personally, but I honestly think maybe my invitation got lost in the U.S. Postal Service and next time they should try to ship with UPS — it’ll guarantee delivery,” O’Brien, who leads the union’s 1.3 million members, quipped today on Fox News.

Last month, O’Brien became the first Teamsters president to address the Republican National Convention. The group plans to make an endorsement after both conventions end.

“The DNC failed to invite one of the most powerful unions in the country there and I’m going to criticize them for that,” O’Brien said today. But, he added, he is “a lifelong Democrat, always will be a lifelong Democrat — never going to change my party affiliation.”

Several labor leaders addressed the DNC last night, including United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, who called Vice President Kamala Harris “a fighter for the working class” and former President Donald Trump “a scab.”

O’Brien said Harris’ campaign agreed to sit down for a “round table” discussion with rank and file members to make its case. Last week, the union’s National Black Caucus broke with O’Brien and endorsed Harris.

Rep. Maxwell Frost: Project 2025 is already happening in Florida

“That's what's going on in my state,” Frost said. “I don't want it to go on in the whole country.”

Florida Democrat Rep. Maxwell Frost said he is motivated to help Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign because he is watching Project 2025 unfold in his state — and wants to stop it from spreading elsewhere.

“Part of the reason I'm so amped up about this campaign and traveling the country to get people to vote for the VP is because Project 2025 — we're experiencing that in the state of Florida right now,” Frost said.

The Orlando Democrat, who is the first member of Gen Z elected to Congress, pointed to examples from Florida, such as 40 percent of banned books being in Florida and Gov. Ron DeSantis taking Frost’s district attorney out of office over political differences.

“That's what's going on in my state,” Frost said. “I don't want it to go on in the whole country.”

Frost also pointed to a policy from the DeSantis administration that faced national scrutiny: an education standard teaching students that “slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.”

The lawmaker, who is also the first Afro-Cuban member of Congress, also touched on the recent discussions over Harris’ mixed race background — including comments from Trump that she ""happened to turn Black"" and Republicans calling her a DEI hire. He said when he first started hearing that Harris is a “DEI hire” — and then just a “DEI” — he felt like it was calling her a “slur.”

“They would call her a DEI. To me, the way that you're saying that, the context that you're saying it — you could replace DEI with racial slurs, any racial slur,” Frost said. “You're saying anything but the N-word. That's the way I feel about it.”

Frost added that Trump’s comments on her mixed race not only “show his ignorance,” but also “shows an inherent racism.” He touched on how he represents a diverse, multicultural district and how he always has to think about how policies could affect different cultures.

“People should be validated for who they are, where they come from,” Frost said. “That's true freedom. That's what it means to be free in this country. That's not what Donald Trump stands for.”

Planned Parenthood Great Rivers offers medication abortions and vasectomies free of charge at a mobile clinic parked near the DNC

Abortion rights activists want Democrats to think more expansively about abortion rights.

Democrats are showcasing on the convention's main stage the stories of women — and men — who have been affected by the abortion bans now in effect in more than a third of the country.

Blocks away, those stories are being written in real time.

Planned Parenthood Great Rivers has for the last two days offered medication abortions and vasectomies free of charge at a mobile clinic parked near the United Center, where the Democratic National Convention is being held. The mobile clinic saw 12 patients on Monday, including two who received medication abortions and 10 who received vasectomies.

Nearby, separated from the clinic by a fence, anti-abortion protesters chanted for a ""pro-life revolution,"" shouting through a megaphone and banging a tambourine. Republicans at the national level have pilloried the clinic’s decision to offer abortion and vasectomy appointments near the convention site, with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green (R-Ga.) on X calling it “truly heartbreaking.”

It's a microcosom of the debate happening across the country over what the future of abortion access should look like in the U.S.

For Dr. Colleen McNicholas, who provided the medication abortions and vasectomies at the clinic this week, that means going beyond restoring Roe v. Wade, which Kamala Harris and other Democrats have been calling for.

McNicholas, sitting inside the mobile clinic Tuesday afternoon, a gold ""bans off our bodies"" emblem pinned to the lapel of her jean jacket, urged policymakers convening nearby to take their time to develop more robust abortion policy instead of rushing to pass Roe-like protections.

The number of abortions has actually increased nationwide since the fall of Roe more than two years ago, as states like Illinois, which has laws protecting abortion access, have expanded services to provide abortions to residents of neighboring states where the procedure is banned, like in Missouri. According to the pro-abortion-rights Guttmacher Institute, there was an 11 percent increase in the number of abortions performed between 2020, the last year for which full estimates are available, and 2023.

""We've done a great job of making sure people understand how they can get access to medication abortion. Folks are ordering that online. They are self-managing their abortions safely. All that to say, although this current state is not a permanent solution, we do have some time to figure out what the right solution is,"" McNicholas said. ""Take a deep breath and figure it out. Let's do it in a way that's actually just. That actually lives out the slogans and the t-shirts and the signs. Yes, Roe is the floor. Yes, bans off all of our bodies. All of those things. Let's actually take the opportunity to let go of the framework which we were handcuffed to.""

But Illinois state Rep. Kelly Cassidy, who has attended at least three meetings on reproductive health care at the White House since the fall of Roe, is encouraged about what a Harris presidency will mean for the future of abortion access. The vice president, she says, ""gets it.""

""She understands that this isn't just about a singular medical procedure,"" Cassidy said outside the mobile clinic. ""She understands this is about control of your life and, as such, I'm excited about what we can do in the birth justice space and in the reproductive justice space.""

Stephanie Grisham has a Republican political operative’s dream resume, but she’ll be speaking Tuesday at Democrats’ convention for one principal reason: Donald and Melania Trump’s handling of the violence and chaos of Jan. 6, 2021.

Grisham worked on the 2012 presidential campaign for Mitt Romney, cut her teeth in Arizona media and politics and then joined the Trump campaign in 2015 as an advance staffer. When Trump pulled off the upset victory, Grisham followed him to the White House, becoming a deputy press secretary, then a communications official to both the president and first lady Melania Trump. She capped her White House tenure as Melania Trump’s chief of staff before resigning on Jan. 6.

Since then, Grisham has fallen out with her party and become a vocal critic of the Trumps. She provided a brief transcribed interview to the Jan. 6 select committee, during which Grisham spilled lots of tea on the fraught relationship between Melania Trump’s East Wing and Donald Trump’s West Wing, including her acrimonious relationship with former chief of staff Mark Meadows.

Grisham described Melania Trump’s increasing concern that her husband was receiving bad advice about his odds of prevailing in the 2020 election during his post-election attempts to reverse his defeat. Grisham’s decision to resign came amid the chaos on Jan. 6, after Melania Trump abruptly refused Grisham’s suggestion to send a tweet aimed at calming the violent mob at the Capitol.

“I was so, so disappointed in her,” Grisham told the committee. “I was more disappointed in her than I had ever, ever been, because she had a chance to take a real leadership role. And I know for a fact she was amazing at influencing her husband sometimes with these kinds of things.”

“You know, that day, for her to just say ‘no,’ I just couldn't take any more.”

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear: JD Vance should have to ‘go through’ a pregnancy after rape

The Ohio senator responded by calling the governor “a disgusting person.”

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Sen. JD Vance are engaged in another heated public skirmish, after the Democratic governor suggested today that Vance should have to experience the circumstances of pregnancy resulting from rape.

“JD Vance calls pregnancy resulting from rape inconvenient,” Beshear said on ""Morning Joe."" ""Inconvenience is traffic. Make him go through this.""

“It is someone being violated, someone being harmed, and then telling them that they don't have options after that,” Beshear continued “That fails any tests of decency of humanity.”

Beshear — who was seen as an early contender to be Kamala Harris’ running mate — addressed the convention Monday after a woman from his state, Hadley Duvall, spoke from stage about being raped by her stepfather and becoming pregnant at age 12.

Vance and Trump’s team promptly jumped on Beshear’s comments.

“What the hell is this? Why is @AndyBeshearKY wishing that a member of my family would get raped?!?” Vance posted on X, in response to a clip of Beshear’s comments. “What a disgusting person.”

Hours later, Beshear defended his comments on the cable news network hours later and asked about Vance’s response.

“It’s ridiculous but it’s also deflection,” Beshear said. JD Vance knows that he and Donald Trump are so wrong on this issue, and so he’s trying to make himself the victim. … As a man, JD Vance will never have to face any of this personally.”

Beshear’s swipe at Vance wasn’t the first time he has gone after the Ohio senator — who had made a habit of hitting back. A day after Biden endorsed Harris to take his place, Beshear again went on ""Morning Joe"" to mock Vance’s discussions of his family ties to Kentucky in his memoir “Hillbilly Elegy,” saying Vance “ain’t from here.”

Vance at the time responded that it was “very weird to have a guy whose first job was at his dad's law firm and inherited the governorship from his father criticize my origin story.”

Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) is going after Chicago in an attempt to counterprogram the Democratic convention.

Speaking to reporters during a news conference in Kenosha, Wisconsin, focused on public safety, the Republican vice presidential nominee said he hadn’t caught much of last night’s DNC speeches. That didn’t stop him from attacking its host city.

“It’s almost a joke to me that they held it in Chicago, which has become the murder capital of the United States of America thanks to very failed Democrat leadership,” Vance said, comparing the city to “a Third World country.”

“My little theory about why they decided to have the convention in Chicago is Tim Walz has been going around saying he served in war and maybe they did it in Chicago so they can accurately say that he visited a combat zone,” Vance added.

Tim Walz interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters

The vice presidential pick did not address the protesters at a Women's Caucus event.

Vice presidential nominee Tim Walz was interrupted while addressing the Women’s Caucus on the sidelines of the Democratic National Convention Tuesday morning by a handful of pro-Palestinian protesters.

The demonstrators from Code Pink chanted “stop killing women in Gaza” and wielded banners that said “Kamala: No weapons to Israel” and ""arms embargo now."" Walz did not address the protesters, who were drowned out by chants of “USA” from the crowd in the ballroom at McCormick Place and quickly escorted out of the room by security.

The disruption comes as delegates in the pro-Palestinian ""uncommitted"" movement have been pushing for not just an immediate and permanent cease-fire in Gaza but an arms embargo against Israel, which Harris does not support. The party platform adopted by Democratic delegates on Monday calls for ""an immediate and lasting cease-fire deal,"" but also stresses Israel's ""ironclad"" right to defend itself.

Still, leaders of the uncommitted movement believe that Harris is more persuadable than President Joe Biden, and they, along with protesters both inside and outside of the convention perimeter, are continuing to push her on the issue.

The convention comes as the administration continues to try to broker a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday that Israel has agreed to a cease-fire deal proposal, and that it's now up to Hamas to agree.

Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson hosted the RNC in Milwaukee last month. Now he's a delegate in Chicago.

The mayor offers some advice to the city of Chicago.

Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson is driving back to his city today to greet Vice President Kamala Harris, who will headline a campaign event at Fiserv Forum.

Johnson played host to Republicans at the very same venue for their convention just last month, and is now attending the Democratic National Convention in Chicago as a delegate.

“This will be my first Democratic National Convention ever,"" Johnson said in an interview. ""So I'm really, really excited about doing that and to do all the things that delegates do.”

POLITICO asked Johnson for tips he’d give to Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson.

“Take it day by day and believe in the team,” said the Milwaukee mayor, referring to the Chicago Police Department, which has worked “very closely with Secret Service” to ensure the convention goes off without a hitch.

“Brace yourself for some consternation in terms of economic impact,” he said, referring to complaints from some Milwaukee restaurateurs who didn’t see the ka-ching they were hoping for.

“Do early morning press conferences just to let folks know what's going on. Give them a lay of the land. Let them know what to expect,” Johnson said.

“Have space to let protesters’ voices be heard.”

Look beyond the short-term impact. “I’m hearing from people who say they want to come back to Milwaukee” to vacation, said Johnson.

Johnson will return to Chicago for the convention later this evening.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer offered an early indication of what the Democratic Party would pursue in Congress if Vice President Kamala Harris can help usher in another trifecta in Washington.

The Democrats' joyful convention in Chicago has been mostly devoid of policy details for a 2025 agenda. But Schumer outlined several specific priorities to reporters Tuesday if Democrats can keep the Senate and White House and win back the House — unlocking the power to push through legislation without GOP votes.

Those priorities, he said, start with housing access, another push on climate and raising taxes on the wealthy.

""Housing is a desperate need all across America,"" Schumer said, noting that it's also a Harris priority. ""It's not just in urban areas like New York City, it's in rural areas. They're desperate for housing, and so housing would be a very important issue for us.""

Obama to make case for Harris tonight

The former president and first lady will both speak Tuesday.

If last night was all about thanking Joe Biden for his ""sacrifice"" for the party, today everything is going to turn to Kamala Harris.

Folks are expected to keep thanking Biden, but the convention now has to fully turn to introducing Harris (and her running mate Tim Walz) to the millions watching.

Democrats tell me it's fitting that the convention planners chose former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama to sort of serve as that bridge. They are the two most popular Democrats in the world and they know first hand the hill Harris will have to climb as a Black woman to win this election.

President Obama will ""affirm why Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are precisely the leaders the country needs right now, lay out the task in front of Democrats over the next eleven weeks, and bring into focus the values at stake in this election and at the heart of our politics,” according to a person familiar with his speech but not authorized to speak publicly.

It will also be the first time folks will hear from Obama since Biden was forced out. As we've reported, there's still some tension between the two because, at best, the former president stayed quiet as his running mate took all those lumps. Watch for how he talks about Biden tonight.

As for the former first lady, the person added that she ""will lay out how Kamala Harris is ready to lead our country forward and turn the page on fear and division."" Let's not forget her ""when they go low"" speech, which ... the party hasn't really stuck to.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, slated to speak Tuesday, is in high demand at the DNC

His schedule includes hitting three breakfast events each day.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who was in contention for Kamala Harris' vice presidential shortlist, is in high demand this week to headline state delegation breakfasts.

He spoke on Monday morning to the Illinois delegation, and has a schedule that includes hitting three breakfast events each day.

Pritzker was a driving force to get the Democratic National Convention to Chicago and has been working behind the scenes to make sure it’s a success.

In an interview with POLITICO in the days ahead of the convention, the governor said he’s confident the four-day event will bring positive attention to the city and the state of Illinois. Just yesterday, the NAACP announced it will hold its 2026 convention in Chicago.

Pritzker said the convention will bring in $150 million to $200 million to the city in the short term, and in the long term it will give a boost to Chicago’s reputation.

As for Pritzker’s political future, the governor said, “It isn't part of the thinking. Honestly, the city is benefiting from this. The Democratic Party benefits significantly from this. And I've been a Democrat my whole life, and I've supported Democrats my whole life, so this, you know, to me, that's what's on the line. We’ve got to win this election in November.”

Pritzker is slated to speak at the convention Tuesday, just ahead of former President Barack Obama. He wouldn’t give details about what he might say, but Pritzker knows he’ll be drawing a “significant distinction” between Harris and Donald Trump and he’ll “extol the virtues” of Chicago and the state of Illinois. He’ll also focus “on the fundamental values of the Democratic Party and what it stands for, and how it matches up so well with the fundamental values of Americans across the country.”

As for the vice presidential nod going to fellow Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, Pritzker gave an Oscar-esqe answer saying it was nice to be nominated and get to the final six among “all spectacular people.”

His take on Walz: “The great thing about Tim Walz is he feels like an everyman. He feels like a guy who you know. He was your coach. He was your social studies teacher. And that's an important thing for people to see.”

As for what’s next for Pritzker and the rest of the Democratic bench if Harris wins? “The opportunity going forward for all of us is, even if Kamala Harris is there for eight more years, is that will mean 12 years of Democratic control of the presidency. That's great for Democratic governors and Democratic states, and so that's all I'm really thinking about.”

An Obama homecoming

Welcome to day 2.

Welcome to Day 2 of the Democratic National Convention — and a homecoming for former President Barack Obama.

Kamala Harris, the vice president, has known Obama for 20 years — going back to when they met on the campaign trail as he was running for Senate in Illinois. She knocked doors for him ahead of the Iowa caucuses when he was running for president.

Tonight, when he takes the stage, Obama will have a platform to help her.

Since 2020, we hear Obama has been in regular touch with Harris to provide counsel and serve as a sounding board, as he has over the years with other high-profile Democrats. Michelle Obama, the former first lady, will speak before the former president.

Also in the spotlight: Two other Democratic stars from Illinois will take the stage today: Gov. JB Pritzker, who was instrumental in bringing the Democratic convention to Chicago, and Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who will address the abortion debate and IVF, an issue that is personal to her.

Pritzker and Duckworth have something forever in common, having both been floated as potential vice presidential contenders: Duckworth in 2020 and Pritzker this year.

Pritzker will also headline one of the discussions at the CNN-POLITICO Grill today. POLITICO’s Jonathan Martin will moderate. Anita Dunn, the former top aide to President Joe Biden, will sit down with Lauren Egan and Eli Stokols. Check back on this page to watch the conversations live.

Rep. Jim Himes, Sen. Mark Warner, Rep. Pete Aguilar and Colorado Gov.

From “The New York Times,” I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Today, in the first debate of the 2024 presidential race, Joe Biden hoped to make the case that Donald Trump was unfit to return to the White House. Instead, Biden’s weak performance deepened doubts about his own fitness for the job.

My colleague, Astead Herndon, a political reporter and a host of “The Run Up,” explains what happened.

It’s Friday, June 28.

Astead, good evening, almost good morning. By the time we’re done talking, it is definitely going to be Friday morning. Thank you for joining us at what is clearly a very tender hour.

astead herndon

No, thank you for having me.

michael barbaro

OK. This was always going to be a historic debate — two single term presidents debating each other for a chance at a second term, both choosing to opt out of the traditional presidential commission authorized debates. We’ve never had any of this before. But that’s not, I would wager, what people are going to remember about this debate. I suspect they’re going to remember just how much one of these candidates openly struggled — struggled mightily on the biggest possible stage.

astead herndon

Yeah, I mean, there were some things I was expecting for tonight’s debate — bitter insults, an incumbent defending a policy record, the challenger really attacking it. But one thing I didn’t expect was for President Biden to kind of live up to the caricature of him that has been really been created over the last six months by Republicans.

And the first 10 minutes, he was not even just a poor debater, he seemed like a struggling old man in a way that, I think for a lot of people, was alarming not even just in a political sense, but in a personal sense. And I think, in the low bar that had been created for him for tonight’s performance, it immediately raised alarm flags that he was not even clearing it.

michael barbaro

Well, let’s talk about what both Biden and Trump were trying to do in this debate before we return to the question of how Biden did or didn’t do, and how Trump did or didn’t do tonight.

astead herndon

For Trump, there is an electoral opening right now for him to really create a coalition that’s unique for a Republican candidate. If you believe the polling or the kind of trend lines that we have seen in polling over the last six months, Donald Trump is not winning back the kind of traditional Republicans he’s lost over the last four years. He’s winning over people who were considered more traditionally Democratic groups or just more disaffected voters in general — younger people, people of color, low income folks, Black folks.

There has been a kind of growth among those margins that’s provided Trump with this ability to say that, if he can put that together in November, there’s a real unique path for him to beat Joe Biden. But that path requires a candidate who’s kind of speaking in more disciplined, controlled tones than I think we’re used to Trump talking. And the Trump campaign was eager to put that best foot forward.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

astead herndon

Now, on the Biden side, they have a fundamental problem, which is that the majority of Americans think the president is too old to serve. And the prospect of an 86-year-old Joe Biden, at the end of his second term, frankly, freaks folks out. And the Biden campaign’s response to that problem has been, frankly, to diminish it, but also say to watch him. And the idea was that if they had an earlier debate before the conventions, and before the race really kicked off, they can put some of those concerns to bed, as we saw him slightly do at the State of the Union earlier this year.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

astead herndon

But as we just talked about, Biden provided his party. No reassurance tonight.

michael barbaro

OK. Well, take us into the meat of this debate, and let’s explore why this night ended up being so problematic for Biden. And let’s try to understand whether Trump did achieve his goal of being the kind of candidate who can assemble this theoretical broad coalition.

astead herndon

Well, let me set the scene.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

We’re live from Georgia, a key battleground state in the race for the White House.

archived recording (dana bash)

Good evening. I’m Dana Bach, anchor of CNN’s —

astead herndon

Dana Bash and Jake Tapper, the moderators, introduced both candidates.

archived recording (jake tapper)

Now, please welcome the 46th President of the United states, Joe Biden.

archived recording (joe biden)

Folks, how are you?

astead herndon

And when Biden walked onto the stage, I mean, it’s generous to call it a walk. He frankly shuffled in a way that was only a visual reminder of the advanced age of this president.

archived recording (jake tapper)

Gentlemen, thanks so much for being here. Let’s begin the debate. And let’s start with the issue that voters consistently say is their top concern, the economy.

astead herndon

And within the first couple answers —

archived recording (jake tapper)

What do you say to voters who feel they are worse off under your presidency than they were under President Trump?

archived recording (joe biden)

Well, you got to take a look at what I was left when I became president, and what Mr. Trump left me.

astead herndon

The immediate thing that was noticeable was not about what he was saying, but about how he sounded.

archived recording (joe biden)

The economy collapsed. There were no jobs. Unemployment rate rose to 15 percent.

astead herndon

Biden’s voice was really raspy.

archived recording (joe biden)

We created 15,000 new jobs, and we brought on the position where —

astead herndon

It sounded as if he needed to clear his throat. He was talking really softly.

archived recording (joe biden)

There’s more to be done. Working class people are still in trouble.

astead herndon

And it made his first couple of answers almost incoherent.

archived recording (joe biden)

What I’m gonna do is fix the tax system. For example, we have 1,000 trillionaires in America, I mean, billionaires in America. And what’s happening?

astead herndon

And then we got to one answer that was literally incoherent —

archived recording (joe biden)

— making sure that we’re able to make every single solitary person a — eligible for what I’ve been able to do with the, uh, with the COVID — excuse me, with, um, dealing with everything we have to do with, uh — look — if — we finally beat Medicare.

archived recording (jake tapper)

Thank you, President Biden. President Trump?

astead herndon

— and eventually ended up trailing off such that it became clear that this was not someone who was fully in command of their presence at the moment. And that really set the tone for Biden’s performance throughout the whole debate.

michael barbaro

Right. This was the moment, if we’re being honest, where everyone in politics and political journalism’s phones just started exploding with text messages, all of them saying some version of, gosh, this debate is going really quite badly for President Biden. And I said, to your point about what he was seeking to do and the assurances he was trying to give people in his party and beyond his party, he was not giving those assurances at all.

astead herndon

Yeah. Let me read you some live text messages I got from Democrats in those first 10 minutes. One says, “I think you have to question seriously whether he can even make it to the end of this night.” Another says, “Man, this just doesn’t feel good to watch.” I mean, it was an immediate sense of panic that was spreading among the party.

And I think it’s because, typically, these debates have an air of optics and showmanship. But for Biden and his kind of political challenge, it was really about that sense of energy and about that sense of command of stage because the question of age has been so circling around his candidacy.

And so for him to immediately come out with a both presentation and an answer that was frankly not substantive and hard to follow, it sent the concerns to the roof. Things went from 0 to 100 very fast, partially because I think that’s what people were coming in seeing as a baseline for him and he very immediately stumbled. I would make an analogy to an Olympic hurdler, where at the first hurdle he fell.

michael barbaro

Donald Trump, on the other hand, doesn’t seem to have lost his edge — that becomes very clear from the beginning of the debate — and instead is displaying his usual swagger, as well as his usual challenges with the facts.

astead herndon

Yeah, absolutely. To the extent that Donald Trump can be focused on policy, he came out in that mode today.

archived recording (donald trump)

We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. And we have never done so well. Everybody was amazed by it. Other countries were copying us. We got hit with COVID, and —

astead herndon

We know that the campaign really wants to focus on three things — inflation, immigration, and crime.

archived recording (donald trump)

The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounce back jobs, the bounce back from the COVID.

astead herndon

And you could see Trump really returning to those in the early kind of 10, 15 minutes.

archived recording (donald trump)

He inherited almost no inflation and it stayed that way for 14 months. And then it blew up under his leadership, because they spent money like a bunch of people that didn’t know what they were doing.

astead herndon

He repeatedly tied Biden to rising prices, and tried to frame the economy that he stewarded as president as significantly better than the one that we are experiencing now.

archived recording (donald trump)

Migrant crime — I call it Biden migrant crime. They’re killing our citizens at a level that we’ve never seen before.

astead herndon

He framed the country as safer four years ago than what we’re experiencing now.

archived recording (donald trump)

And it’s a shame. What’s happened to our country in the last four years is not to be believed.

astead herndon

You could see him trying to follow through on the kind of classic premise of a re-election campaign where the challenger really tries to ask the question, are you better off than you were four years ago? And so we got the Donald Trump version of that tonight. But we should be clear, it’s infused with a lot of his usual set of falsehoods, as we have come to expect from him.

michael barbaro

And what struck me was — for all the exaggerations and some of the falsehoods in what Trump was saying — the contrast between his swagger and his presentation and Biden’s became the most pronounced part of this back and forth.

astead herndon

Yeah. I think you’re right that Trump sounded and felt a little more, dare we say, presidential than Biden in those first 10 minutes. But the bar was on the floor, because the president came out with such, I think, a shocking level of incoherence that it made Donald Trump — the Donald Trump we have seen spew falsehoods, conspiracies, unhingedness at every turn — it made him seem like the person who kind of had their ducks in a row.

archived recording (joe biden)

There are 40 percent fewer people coming across the border illegally. That’s better than when he left office.

astead herndon

And in a kind of crystallizing moment of this interaction —

archived recording (joe biden)

And I’m going to continue to move until we get the total ban on the — the total initiative relative to what we’re going to do with more border patrol and more asylum officers.

astead herndon

— after one of Biden’s more meandering answers, Trump responds with a quip that really said what everyone was thinking.

archived recording (jake tapper)

President Trump?

archived recording (donald trump)

I really don’t know what he said at the end of that sentence, but I don’t think he knows what he said either. Look —

astead herndon

— saying that, I don’t know what Biden said at the end of the sentence and I don’t know if he does either.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

archived recording (dana bash)

This is the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

michael barbaro

archived recording (dana bash)

— which returned the issue of abortion to the states.

archived recording (donald trump)

Correct.

michael barbaro

astead herndon

No, it didn’t. And I think that speaks to the point that came through during this debate, that it was consistently not the message, it was the messenger. Abortion has been a politically potent issue for Democrats, and something that folks have been looking for Biden to speak to directly.

archived recording (dana bash)

Do you support any legal limits on how late a woman should be able to terminate a pregnancy?

archived recording (joe biden)

I supported Roe v. Wade —

astead herndon

And he kind of botched that framing.

archived recording (joe biden)

— which had three trimesters. The first time was between the woman and the doctor. The second time was between the doctor and an extreme situation. The third time is between the doctor — I mean, between the woman and the state.

astead herndon

He was trying to seemingly make an analogy about trimesters that didn’t really come through very clearly. And so that, I think, was a moment where, when the moderator brought it up, you would feel Democrats think, OK, this is something that might play better for us than the economy or immigration. But, like a lot of things in this debate, Biden just didn’t seem to put it together that well.

michael barbaro

Eventually, in this first half of the debate, things start to get a bit more personal, and they start to get a bit nastier between these two candidates who clearly do not like each other at all. And interestingly, given your framing of would Trump moderate some of his excesses, it was Biden who went there first.

astead herndon

Yeah, it was. And we should put the background here. There was previous reporting that Donald Trump had called fallen soldiers “suckers and losers” while touring a military gravesite.

archived recording (joe biden)

I went to the World War II cemetery — World War I cemetery he refused to go to. He was standing with this four-star general and he told him, he said, I don’t want to go in there because they’re a bunch of losers and suckers.

astead herndon

And that’s what Biden was referring to, framing Trump as someone who has consistently disrespected veterans.

archived recording (joe biden)

We’re also in a situation where we have great respect for veterans. My son spent a year in Iraq.

astead herndon

But Biden plans on saying —

archived recording (joe biden)

My son was not a loser, was not a sucker.

astead herndon

And then looks to Trump and says —

archived recording (joe biden)

You’re the sucker. You’re the loser.

astead herndon

— you’re the sucker. You’re the loser.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

astead herndon

And I thought, for me, this reflected the Biden campaign strategy of wanting to draw Trump out to kind bring out, let’s say, a more chaotic version of him that was less stuck to the policy script. And so I was looking at this moment to see, OK, how was Trump going to respond to this.

archived recording (donald trump)

First of all, that was a made up quote, “suckers and losers.” They made it up. It was in a third-rate magazine that’s failing, like many of these —

astead herndon

He denied kind of making the “suckers and losers” remark about dead soldiers. But he didn’t kind of respond on the personal level in which Biden was trying to draw him out to.

archived recording (donald trump)

It was made up by him, just like Russia, Russia, Russia was made up, just like —

astead herndon

He reframed the conversation about commander in chief to be about the kind of global instability that has happened under Biden’s watch.

archived recording (donald trump)

I’ll tell you what happened. He was so bad with Afghanistan, it was such a horrible embarrassment, the most embarrassing —

astead herndon

This is when he mentions the kind of Afghanistan withdrawal —

archived recording (donald trump)

We lost 13 beautiful soldiers and 38 soldiers were obliterated. And, by the way, we left people —

astead herndon

— and kind of starts framing the world is more generally unsafe under Biden than it was under Trump.

archived recording (donald trump)

That’s why you had no terror at all during my administration. This place, the whole world is blowing up under him.

astead herndon

Now, certainly, that’s done in a kind of Trumpian way. But it was an example of him, at least at that moment, not really meeting Biden in the mud and trying to stay focused on what I think was his campaign’s goal in this night, which was to present him as someone making a policy first challenge to Biden rather than a personal one.

michael barbaro

Right. And what seems to happen for the next 10 or 15 minutes in the debate is that Biden keeps trying to get under Trump’s skin, and really make the case that there’s nothing about him that makes him fit to be president.

astead herndon

Yeah. You could feel President Biden trying to draw out the more crazy, chaotic side of Donald Trump. Some of the attacks were lighter.

archived recording (joe biden)

And now he says if he loses again, such a whiner that he is, that it’s going to be a bloodbath?

astead herndon

Things like calling him a whiner, for example.

archived recording (joe biden)

— for doing a whole range of things, of having sex with a porn star —

astead herndon

At one point, he pointed out the allegations that Donald Trump had sex with a porn star while his wife was pregnant.

archived recording (joe biden)

You have the morals of an alley cat.

astead herndon

And at another point —

archived recording (joe biden)

The only person on this stage who’s a convicted felon is the man I’m looking at right now.

astead herndon

— he mentioned the most serious, I think, of the political allegations, which is the idea that Donald Trump, as convicted felon, is unfit to be president. And you could see Trump physically wince when the words felon were said out loud, which I think is reflective to just how much that label really stings him.

archived recording (jake tapper)

I’m going to give you a minute, president Trump, for a follow up question I have. After a jury convicted you of 34 felonies last month, you said, if re-elected, you would, quote, “have every right to go after,” unquote, your political opponents. You just talked about members of the select committee on January 6 going to jail. Your main political opponent is standing on stage with you tonight. Can you clarify exactly what it means about you feeling you have every right to go after your political opponents?

astead herndon

When he talks about January 6, it becomes very clear that he’s trying to obfuscate his own role.

archived recording (donald trump)

And let me tell you about January 6.

astead herndon

Trump goes into a soliloquy about, oh, January 6 —

archived recording (donald trump)

On January 6, we were energy independent. On January 6, we had the lowest taxes ever. We had the lowest regulations ever.

astead herndon

— completely actually diverting the question that was at hand, which is did Donald Trump encourage a mob that struck at the heart of democracy.

archived recording (jake tapper)

You have 80 seconds left. My question was, what do you say to those voters who believe that you violated your constitutional oath through your actions and inaction on January 6, 2021, and worry that you’ll do it again?

archived recording (donald trump)

Well, I didn’t say that to anybody. I said, peacefully and patriotically. And Nancy Pelosi, if you just watch —

[MUSIC PLAYING]

astead herndon

And so that’s the kind of push and pull that we were seeing play out on the stage, which is that certainly Trump was engaging in his normal level of kind of dodges and falsehoods. But it was coming off, I think, more successfully than some expected, partially because Biden was just ineffective in landing some of those attacks.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

So, Astead, the second half of the debate starts with a question that feels quite central to what you described as Trump’s strategy of trying to build this bigger coalition that exists in theory that he’s trying to make real in November. And it’s a question the moderators ask of Biden, and why he seems to have disappointed Black America.

astead herndon

Yeah, and you’re right. Biden knows that Black voters are an overwhelmingly Democratic constituency. And theoretically, if those folks came home to support him, it wouldn’t be much harder to see the path for Donald Trump’s victory.

archived recording (dana bash)

What do you say to Black voters who are disappointed with the progress so far?

astead herndon

And so he tries to give a little two-part answer here —

archived recording (joe biden)

I say, I don’t blame them for being disappointed. Inflation is still hurting them badly. For example, I provided for the idea that any Black family, first time home buyer, should get a $10,000 tax credit.

astead herndon

— both acknowledging that Black voters are right to feel some disappointment in Democrats, while also pointing to some things his administration has done to provide support for those communities.

archived recording (donald trump)

He’s blaming inflation, and he’s right. It’s been very bad. He caused the Inflation and it’s killing Black families.

astead herndon

And you hear Trump saying that none of those things are mattering because inflation is hurting Black communities more —

archived recording (donald trump)

His big kill on the Black people is the millions of people that he’s allowed to come in through the border. They’re taking Black jobs now.

astead herndon

— and also that immigration is taking what Trump dubs, quote unquote, “Black jobs.” Now, I’m not exactly sure what Black jobs are. But we could guess that Trump here is trying to mean that an influx of immigration has hurt specifically Black communities more than other ones.

archived recording (donald trump)

You haven’t seen it yet, but you’re going to see something that’s going to be the worst in our history.

archived recording (dana bash)

Thank you.

astead herndon

That’s, again, Trump hitting that three-pronged message in one — inflation, immigration, and crime. And those things are all wrapped up in that answer. And it’s really the pitch that Trump is giving to Black voters.

michael barbaro

So this is Trump executing on the strategy that you mentioned him wanting to execute on in this debate, which is finding a way of appealing to this group of voters, traditionally Democratic through and through, who are intrigued by him and might come to him in this election. He is threading a complicated needle in seeking their votes. He’s seeming to succeed a bit.

astead herndon

Yes and no. Because I also think this answer was a real reminder of how Donald Trump is not a natural communicator on these issues, and frankly, often sounds like an unhinged man himself. Whether it be “Black jobs,” quote, unquote, or in his next answer about climate change, there were some moments in this debate that definitely reminded us of the Donald Trump who lost four years ago, frankly, because most of the country did find him unacceptable.

archived recording (dana bash)

Will you take any action as president to slow the climate crisis?

archived recording (donald trump)

Well, let me just go back to what he said about the police.

astead herndon

When asked about climate change, he doesn’t answer the question at all.

archived recording (dana bash)

President Trump, will you take any action as president to slow the climate crisis?

astead herndon

And then, after a follow-up by the moderators, he goes on a kind of classic Trump soliloquy —

archived recording (donald trump)

So I want absolutely immaculate clean water.

astead herndon

— about how I want absolutely immaculate clean water, and I want absolutely clean air —

archived recording (donald trump)

And we had it. We had h2o. We had the best numbers ever.

astead herndon

— how we have the best h2o. It’s the Trump of the memes that frankly, I think, gets him further away from who he wants to be if he’s going to pass his own kind of standard in terms of reaching different folks for November.

michael barbaro

Right. What kept striking me in this second half, as in this climate change exchange, is just how consistently Trump is not answering the questions that the moderators are asking him.

astead herndon

Oh, absolutely. Whether it be questions about child care, Medicare, whether it’s questions about opioids, these are core issues people cared about. And Trump almost never responded to the moderators’ direct questions about those things. He almost always stayed in those three buckets that were clearly his focus to attack Biden — economy, immigration, crime.

michael barbaro

It’s around here that the moderators turn to a question that has been on everyone’s mind at this point all night, which is the candidates’ age. And they start with Biden, whose age has been quite present in this debate. So tell us how that unfolds.

astead herndon

Yeah. The moderators put to the candidates directly the question about whether these are people who even physically or mentally can lead the country for the next four years. And Biden, I have to say, didn’t inspire much confidence.

archived recording (joe biden)

First of all, I spent half my career being criticized as being the youngest person in politics.

astead herndon

He starts off by saying he spent half his career being criticized for how young he was. And then he goes on to say that you should judge him for the job that he’s done in office.

archived recording (joe biden)

Look at what I’ve done. Look how I’ve turned around the horrible situation he left me. As I said —

astead herndon

He’s saying to judge him by what he did rather than how old he is. The problem is that the first part of the debate was so defined by how inarticulate he was, that the question of age had been suddenly already answered and he had flunked that test. Now, Trump responds in a maybe even more ridiculous fashion —

archived recording (dana bash)

What do you say to voters who have concerns about your capabilities to serve?

archived recording (donald trump)

Well, I took two tests, cognitive tests. I aced them, both of them, as you know.

astead herndon

— talking about the mental acuity test that he has taken —

archived recording (donald trump)

I just won two club championships — not even senior — two regular club champions.

astead herndon

— and focusing on his own golf game —

michael barbaro

Right.

astead herndon

— saying that he can hit a ball 50 yards, and that that’s an example of how he feels in physical good shape, akin to 25 and 30 years ago.

michael barbaro

Right. And this is when we enter the strangest moment, I have to think, in presidential debate history — two rather old men wrangling over who has the better golf game.

archived recording (joe biden)

Look, I’d be happy to have a driving contest with him. I got my handicap, which when I was vice president, down to a six. And, by the way, I told you before, I’m happy to play golf if you carry your own bag. Think you can do it?

archived recording (donald trump)

That’s the biggest lie, that he’s a six handicap, of all.

archived recording (joe biden)

I was an eight handicap —

astead herndon

I have to say, this moment personally kind of bummed me out. There was a 1-minute period where the two options to leading the country were arguing over their golf handicaps.

archived recording (donald trump)

I’ve seen you swing. I know you swing. Let’s not act like children.

astead herndon

Something about the debate about whose golf handicap was better felt like a distillation of the failure of this debate to really provide the American people with the options and the kind of serious policy discussion that the office warrants.

michael barbaro

Astead, by the end of this 90-minute debate, it really felt like the consuming question that it produced wasn’t so much about whether Donald Trump was going to assemble a coalition that won him the presidency. The burning question seemed to be around President Biden and his weak performance. And so I want to make sure we end there, with an understanding of what now happens because of how Joe Biden performed, and what it’s going to mean for the rest of the race.

astead herndon

Yeah. I had come into the debate thinking that the onus was on Donald Trump to prove himself as a disciplined challenger who could take what was a polling possibility of a broad coalition and make it real. But frankly, that belief was based on the assumption that Joe Biden would clear the baseline of coherence that would make the age question at least neutralized for the night. But by the end of the night, it became clear that that wasn’t where the conversation would be.

I think that Joe Biden’s performance was frankly so disastrous that a Democratic party freak out that has been bubbling under a lid for months now has now exploded into the open to the point where you have his former communications director on television saying that was a poor performance.

michael barbaro

Right. Kate Bedingfield. That struck me too. His former White House communications director went on TV and said that was a disappointing debate performance from President Biden — something Democratic communications directors don’t normally say on the record moments after a debate ends.

astead herndon

Absolutely. Also, I saw an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris and Anderson Cooper immediately after the debate where the Vice President, the cheerleader in chief for the president, said very explicitly that she would not deny he had a rough start, but believes that he got better at the end, and saying the last 90 minutes does not erase the last 3 and 1/2 years — a real acknowledgment of the hole that Biden, frankly, put himself in throughout tonight’s debate.

But I got to say, as someone who has dedicated the last year and a half to asking a lot of Democrats questions about how we arrived at an 81-year-old president running for re-election, they have consistently dismissed the overwhelming evidence that most Americans thought Biden was too old to run for a second term. I brought that question to them at the DNC —

michael barbaro

I remember.

astead herndon

— as they were making his path to the nomination easier. And the answer that, frankly, we got at the time was that Donald Trump would be so inherently invalid, none of that would matter. But there was no evidence to support that. That was their own belief that that would just change.

And then tonight, not only did Donald Trump not seem like someone who was completely unfit for the office of president, but that Biden was the memed version of himself, the incoherent, falling off a bike, TikTok caricature of himself. And I think now the Democrats are openly panicking about what Biden should do next, about what the party should do next, they have a lot fewer options at their disposal.

michael barbaro

Right. There is really no plan B because of how Democratic leaders handled this situation for so long.

astead herndon

Yes. There is no plan B because they refused to ask the questions that would even lead to the creation of a plan B in the lead up to this. And so there aren’t really clear solutions as to what Democrats should do going forward. And that really, I think, is going to scare a lot of democrats. Because if you’re someone who wants Joe Biden to be president, a lot of those people believe that Donald Trump is a grave danger to this country. And the belief was that Joe Biden was the person uniquely positioned to stop that from happening.

michael barbaro

Because he had done it four years before.

astead herndon

Because he had done it four years ago. But I think what’s changed from last night to today is a realization that actually nominating Joe Biden might be the biggest risk for the party, and be the very thing that makes a second term of Donald Trump most possible.

Here’s what else you need to know today. On Thursday, the Supreme Court blew up a landmark legal settlement between prosecutors and Purdue Pharma the maker of Oxycontin. The settlement would have channeled $6 billion into alleviating the opioid epidemic that Purdue Pharma allegedly played a major role in creating. But the settlement relied on a promise to shield members of the Sackler family, that created Purdue Pharma, from future lawsuits. And in their 5 to 4 ruling, the Supreme Court found that shield to be illegal and invalid.

The case was one of several major rulings on Thursday. In another decision, the court temporarily cleared the way for women in Idaho to receive emergency abortions when their health is at risk, despite a state law there all but banning the procedure. In a third decision, the court blocked a federal plan to reduce air pollution that drifts across state lines — a legal defeat for President Biden.

dc94801b06,Daily Kos,Wall Street Journal runs stunning hit piece on Biden - Daily Kos,"The Wall Street Journal published a seemingly damning story on Tuesday night about President Joe Biden’s diminishing mental acuity, with a headline guaranteed to cause panic: “Behind Closed Doors, Biden Shows Signs of Slipping.”

With a header like that, you might think the Journal really has the goods on Biden this time, with quotes from dozens of sources within the White House, likely speaking anonymously for fear of appearing to betray their boss with the damaging confessions about how he, in fact, is too old and unfit to be president for another term.

But no. Who does the Journal have? Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson. And former Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. And Idaho Sen. James Risch, who is—as you might have guessed—a Republican.

Contrary to its terrifying headline, what the Journal has is a blatant hit piece from Republicans who are shamelessly pushing the Republican talking point that Biden—who is only four years older than Donald Trump—is oh so very, very old. Concerningly so.

Let’s take a closer look at this smear masquerading as reporting.

In a February one-on-one chat in the Oval Office with House Speaker Mike Johnson, the president said a recent policy change by his administration that jeopardizes some big energy projects was just a study, according to six people told at the time about what Johnson said had happened. Johnson worried the president’s memory had slipped about the details of his own policy.

In other words, Johnson is concerned about Biden’s memory, according to “six people” Johnson told. Were those six people Democrats? The report doesn’t say, but it’s probably a safe bet that the answer is no. So, the Republican speaker told six other Republicans about Biden’s supposedly bad memory. And those six Republicans dutifully informed the Journal of Johnson’s definitely not partisan or biased or perhaps entirely bullshit concerns.

Amazingly, you know who else shares those concerns? Johnson’s predecessor—also a Republican.

Last year, when Biden was negotiating with House Republicans to lift the debt ceiling, his demeanor and command of the details seemed to shift from one day to the next, according to then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and two others familiar with the talks. On some days, he had loose and spontaneous exchanges with Republicans, and on others he mumbled and appeared to rely on notes.

“I used to meet with him when he was vice president. I’d go to his house,” McCarthy said in an interview. “He’s not the same person.”

No reason at all to think that McCarthy is anything but an objective and unbiased source, except for the fact that he’s a dethroned former House speaker with a reputation for being so excessively and cynically partisan that his fellow Republicans tanked his first run for the top job in 2015 because his big mouth got the party in trouble.

So what else does the Journal have to justify such a shocking headline?

Questions about Biden’s age were amplified in February when Special Counsel Robert K. Hur, who interviewed him for roughly five hours over two days in October during the probe into his handling of classified documents, reported that Biden’s memory had been “significantly limited.”

Ah yes, questions about Biden’s age were “amplified.” The classic passive voice that allows reporters to avoid having to spell out who exactly did the amplifying.

Well, there was The New York Times, where the opinion pages were filled with hand-wringing about Biden’s age and how voters are so much more concerned about the 81-year-old president than his 77-year-old opponent.

And of course there were the Republicans in the House, who quickly announced they would launch an investigation into just how very old Biden is. Their hearing on the matter didn’t exactly go as planned, though, and they ended up embarrassing themselves more than anything else.

Does the Journal offer any other evidence of Biden’s “signs of slipping”?

The president moved so slowly around the Cabinet Room to greet the nearly two dozen congressional leaders that it took about 10 minutes for the meeting to begin, some people who attended recalled.

The famously gregarious Biden, taking his time to make his way around a room of more than 20 VIPs and share a personal word with each one? The same Biden who spent over half an hour gabbing with attendees after his State of the Union address—long after Johnson closed the House session and turned off the lights? Hard to believe.

The Journal does at least include a quote from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who has an entirely different—and on the record—take on that same meeting. And the Journal did talk to several other on-the-record White House staffers who disputed the anonymous GOP gossip about the meeting. And there’s also Gene Sperling, a Biden aide, who said that it’s perfectly normal and standard practice for presidents to read from their notes in such meetings.

But that’s somehow far less compelling than what Republican leaders and former leaders and their staff have to say. Thus, a headline that Biden is slipping, not a headline that Republicans say Biden is slipping even though a bunch of other people disagree.

“What you see on TV is what you get,” said Sen. James E. Risch, an Idaho Republican, who attended the meeting but shared only his general impression of meetings with Biden. “These people who keep talking about what a dynamo he is behind closed doors—they need to get him out from behind closed doors, because I didn’t see it.”

Oh, is that the smoking gun? A Republican senator says Biden isn’t a “dynamo.” Certainly he has no agenda.

The article goes on and on—and on and on; it’s over 3,000 words long—like this. Unnamed “people” say negative things about meetings with Biden. Named Democrats and government officials dispute those descriptions.

“I found him to be the same Joe Biden that I’ve known since I came to Congress,” said Rep. Gregory Meeks, a Democrat elected in 1998, who attended one of these supposedly problematic meetings.

But on and on the Journal goes.

Another story suggests that Biden didn’t understand his own energy policy. At least, that’s Johnson’s version of events, as filtered through “several people familiar with Johnson’s version of what happened.” Those unidentified Johnson confidantes also claim Johnson was “dismayed” by Biden’s failing memory.

But then, that’s just Johnson’s version.

Meanwhile, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates calls that take “a false account.”

So who's telling the truth? Of course, the Journal doesn’t say. It lets the readers decide with its extremely objective headline definitively telling them that Biden is “slipping.”

Naturally, Johnson didn’t want his fingerprints on this hit job.

“Johnson declined to be interviewed for this article,” the article says. But not to worry—Johnson’s spokesperson, Taylor Haulsee, confirmed that Johnson stands by all of it.

And on and on it goes.

Does it matter that Democrats refute the Republican version of each incident in the report? Apparently not. Does it matter that Republicans are pushing a campaign talking point they’ve been pushing for months about Biden’s mental fitness? Apparently not.

What matters is that “people” are concerned, and that’s quite enough to justify the story and its headline.

The article ends with this anecdote:

As Republican negotiators drove away from the White House, they called a colleague to update him on the talks, according to someone familiar with the call. One topic of discussion: the president and his acuity.

What did those Republicans say about Biden’s “acuity”? Did they say, “Gosh, he might be older than dirt, but he’s sharp as a knife”? After all, one top Republican, according to a New York Times report last year, ""told allies that he has found Mr. Biden to be mentally sharp in meetings.""

That top Republican, by the way, was Kevin McCarthy.

Who knows? The Journal leaves that to you, dear reader, to choose your own adventure.

There’s another version of this article that Journal reporters Annie Linskey and Siobhan Hughes could have written.

It’s the story of a Republican Party desperate to regain control of the White House even as their presidential nominee is convicted on 34 felony charges and faces dozens of further counts in multiple criminal cases.

It’s the story of a chaotic Republican House caucus in a constant state of civil war frantically searching for some way—any way—to tarnish the president.

It’s the story of a transparent attempt by that very Republican Party to convince voters that Biden, who is old, is somehow more unfit for the office than Trump, who is almost as old and is also a convicted criminal and universally recognized as a deplorable human being.

It’s the story of a pathetic partisan hit job attempt that veteran reporters should be too savvy to fall for, especially in the face of such consistent reporting to the contrary.

But alas, that’s not the story the Wall Street Journal decided to tell.",A man in a blue suit stands in front of a building with a large arched window and a light fixture above.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BA10E5660>,2024-06-04 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.dailykos.com,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2024/6/4/2244815/-Wall-Street-Journal-runs-stunning-hit-piece-on-Biden,['Politics'],[0.95],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/dc94801b06.png
3fbcbaaa57,Financial Times,UBS risks becoming a victim of its own success - Financial Times,"UBS chief executive Sergio Ermotti might be coming down with a touch of Dimon-itis. This condition sometimes affects those running globally significant banks, who after piling in for the good of the system then start to question why. JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon has been known to bemoan the flak his bank took after buying beleaguered Bear Stearns during the financial crisis. Critics, in effect, questioned if he’d got too good of a deal.

Ermotti’s growing headache emanates from UBS’s emergency takeover of Credit Suisse last year. Local politicians are already hammering terms which they now see as too generous. That view may not be changed by how well the deal seems to be going: UBS on Wednesday said net profit was $1.1bn in the second quarter, or about twice as much as expected — in part thanks to success in integrating the two banks and shedding non-core assets.

New Swiss “too big to fail” rules — part of the blowback to the deal — are likely to keep a lid on returns over the next few years. That should contain any excitement over shareholders’ probable share of the haul.

The question is just how much equity capital the bank must have in order to protect against future losses. The common equity tier 1 ratio was 14.9 per cent at the end of the second quarter. That is above management’s target of 14 per cent, even with the $1bn of buybacks planned this year. It is also about 3.5 percentage points above regulatory minimums. But these are set to rise in line with the bank’s scale and significance.

Swiss regulators are currently assessing capital levels following the failure of Credit Suisse. Their focus in particular is that current rules for some assets and foreign subsidiaries are too lenient. The result could be a double whammy of inflation in risk-weighted assets and higher capital buffers.

For simplicity’s sake the leverage ratio, which ignores risk weights to calculate capital levels, is a lens to view the potential impact. This is expected to be 4.8 per cent at UBS this year, according to Visible Alpha. Say it were to rise in line with Morgan Stanley’s expected 6.1 per cent, an additional $20bn of CET1 might be needed at UBS. That is only a little less than the expected dividends and buybacks for 2025 to 2027.

The outcome probably won’t be that high. But Swiss regulators, caught napping with Credit Suisse, will want to claim a gold-plated regime for the outsized bank left behind. With wrangling ongoing, the question is to what extent UBS can limit becoming a victim of its own deal’s success.","The image shows the UBS logo with a snowflake design, set against a backdrop of a grand, architectural structure with a staircase leading up to a central archway.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BCC03D330>,2024-08-14 14:06:18.470000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/1e50d4fc-c959-4043-8ed4-adbb84933a82,['Business and Finance' 'International'],[0.95 0.75],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/3fbcbaaa57.png
2a9ed45484,The Globe and Mail,Canadian museums happy to report they hold few Benin bronzes - The Globe and Mail,"Canada is a bit player in the world’s biggest art restitution story – and that’s good news.

Four Canadian museums hold a total of 11 objects from the Kingdom of Benin, the historic African civilization whose art was looted by British troops in 1897 and is now scattered through Western institutions.

One of the clearest examples of colonial theft in the museum world, the objects widely known as the Benin Bronzes are at the heart of an international campaign to document the art and negotiate its return.

Restitution has been complicated, however, by disagreements over the rightful owners. Originally, the state of Nigeria, which covers the territory that was once historic Benin (not to be confused with the contemporary Republic of Benin next door), laid claim, with the agreement of the international community. This summer some support has emerged for returning the art to a descendant of the kings to whom it originally belonged, the Oba whose ownership was backed by a Nigerian presidential decree last year.

For example, the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African Art in Washington transferred 29 works to Nigeria’s National Commission for Museums and Monuments in 2022. Yet, in July, an art museum at the University of Iowa confounded the museum community by deciding to give two artifacts to the current Oba, Ewuare II, a traditional ruler in Nigeria’s Edo state who was crowned in 2016.

The objects take their name from the most spectacular pieces, the remarkably detailed and naturalistic plaques of human figures and life-size heads made of bronze or brass; the plaques decorated the Oba’s palace walls while the heads were commemorative portraits. However, the category also includes items made of iron, ivory and wood.

The artifacts, the artistic wealth of the kingdom, were looted in 1897 after a bloody trade dispute between Britain and Benin.

Founded in the 11th century, Benin was a wealthy state controlling trade on the west coast of Africa and the Niger River. In the late 19th century, Britain, which obtained palm oil and ivory from Benin and was colonizing its neighbours, forced an exclusive trade treaty on the Oba. Complaining its terms were not being met, the British organized a parlay with the Oba that went disastrously wrong, leading to the massacre of 250 British troops. The British retaliated with the Benin punitive expedition, killing hundreds, burning the capital and looting the Oba’s palace. Thousands of objects wound up in European and North American museums, some donated by descendants of the officers who had looted them; others purchased on the art market.

However, very few items found their way to Canada.

“We are pretty far down the list,” said Stéphane Aquin, director at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, the largest Canadian custodian with merely five Benin items in its collection. The British Museum in London holds the largest group of all with 944 items. Montreal’s collection includes three bronze and brass pieces that typify Benin artistry. One is a plaque, about 50 centimetres high, showing a Benin courtier holding a ceremonial hammer and wearing a bowler hat of a kind adopted from Portuguese traders. It dates to the 16th or 17th century, and is the oldest and most significant of Montreal’s objects.

The collection also includes an 18th-century brass staff topped by a bird and two other metal figures from the 19th century, a pendant mask and a commemorative head commissioned by one Oba after his predecessor’s death. The collection also includes a ceremonial carved ivory tusk that would have been placed with a commemorative head on an altar. The plaque, the head and the tusk are all on display in the MMFA’s galleries dedicated to global art.

The Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto also has a 19th-century tusk and a wooden commemorative head, and one of the brass plaques from the palace walls, forged by the brass-makers guild in Benin and dating to the mid-16th century. Its fourth artifact is a small bronze figure of a warrior that postdates the looting.

None of the ROM’s objects are on display but they are listed in Digital Benin, a project run out of Hamburg’s Rothenbaum Museum of World Cultures with international and Nigerian participation. Launched in 2020, it aims to establish a complete digital catalogue of all the scattered Benin art. Currently, it lists 5,285 objects from 136 institutions in 20 countries. Only 400 objects are located in Nigeria.

As well as listing their objects on Digital Benin, the ROM and the MMFA participate in the Benin dialogue group. European museums and Nigerian institutions launched the group in 2010 with the goal of seeing the objects reassembled in a museum in Benin City in Edo state. The Nigerian participation includes both its museums commission and the local Edo government but also the Royal Court of Benin. Jesus College at Cambridge became the first to restore an object, handing over a bronze cockerel to the museums commission in 2021 in a ceremony at which the Oba’s brother was present.

The situation seemed relatively straightforward – the art should be returned to Nigeria via the museums commission – until 2023 when outgoing president Muhammadu Buhari published a decree stating the bronzes should be returned to Ewuare.

In July, the Stanley Museum of Art at the University of Iowa caused some consternation when it returned a brass plaque and wooden altarpiece directly to Ewuare, the first U.S. institution to favour the royal claim. In an interview with the Art Newspaper, Stanley director Lauren Lessing said: “It is not my job to tell people what to do with their own possessions. The two works of art restituted were stolen from the Oba of Benin in 1897, and they belong to him.” She added that Ewuare has expressed interest in making international loans.

The competing claims, however, have stalled restitution. The Museum of Archeology and Anthropology at Cambridge University was about to return 116 objects when the presidential decree was circulated and the plan was put on hold. Similarly, Germany has paused a 2022 agreement that eventually would have seen more than 1,000 objects returned from its museums.

The ROM says it will continue to participate in the Benin dialogue group while the MMFA says it will wait for Nigerians to resolve the complex issue.

“I don’t think we’d be the first in line to be asked,” Aquin said, pointing to multiple museums that hold hundreds of Benin objects. He also noted that in terms of artistic quality and historic value only Montreal’s 17th-century plaque would be considered particularly desirable.

The Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia only has an undated brass and copper arm cuff bought from a London gallery in 1960, but the Canadian Museum of History’s single object is an interesting one: a bronze bell with a human face using a casting technique that would date it to the 16th century and workshops outside of Benin, in the area of the lower Niger.

It arrived at the Canadian museum in 1970, but it’s a good example of the way these objects can be traced back to the looting. It was collected in 1897, probably by W.D. Webster, a member of the punitive expedition, and then sold to Augustus Pitt Rivers, the British general and collector for whom the museum at Oxford University is named. Today the Pitt Rivers holds 148 objects and says it is following Nigerian developments closely.",Two images of a carved wooden figure with a detailed headdress and a face with a patterned background.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BE20C6560>,2024-08-16 14:00:00+00:00,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/article-canadian-museums-happy-to-report-they-hold-few-benin-bronzes/,['International' 'Politics'],[0.9 0.8],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/2a9ed45484.png
dec7b9ea49,The Guardian,The Guardian view on taxing billionaires: we need to talk about the super-rich - The Guardian,"In his book The Society of Equals, the leading French sociologist Pierre Rosanvallon identifies the rise of the global super-rich as inimical to a shared social order. “The secession of the wealthy,” writes Prof Rosanvallon, means that “the richest sliver of the population now lives in a world unto itself”.

Tax avoidance is perhaps the most obvious and resented way in which this “separatism” of the rich manifests itself. Whether through silting their money away in tax havens, or exploiting loopholes and using creative accounting, the world’s billionaires these days pay a far smaller proportion of their income to fund public goods than the rest of us. In the 1960s, the 400 richest Americans paid more than half their income in taxes. By 2018, it was less than a quarter.

At a time when governments around the world are struggling with high levels of debt, and facing dramatic challenges such as dealing with the consequences of the climate emergency, this crazy, upside down state of affairs should be seen as intolerable. Such glaring inequity undermines the bonds of reciprocity and trust that sustain healthy societies. But for too long reform has been judged too difficult and too complicated, despite being enthusiastically backed by voters.

Happily, there are signs that, at least at an international level, the political mood is shifting. In July, G20 finance ministers will discuss new proposals for an annual 2% global tax on the wealth of the world’s 3,000 or so billionaires. According to the French economist Gabriel Zucman, the architect of the plan, the wealth tax could raise $250bn a year – more than the recently established global minimum tax on corporations, and roughly the cost of the economic damage wrought by extreme weather events in 2023. Ahead of the G20, the governments of Brazil (which holds the presidency), France, South Africa and Spain have expressed support for Prof Zucman’s idea.

Despite such backing, the path to actually introducing such a tax is likely to be long and tortuous. Watertight criteria for assessing different types of wealth and assets would have to be worked out and, crucially, a way found to deal with non-participating tax jurisdictions. Prof Zucman believes neither of these problems to be insuperable; other sympathetic experts in the field have reservations. And as was the case with a proposed “Robin Hood” tax on financial transactions in the 2010s, there would inevitably be a ferocious resistance campaign on behalf of some of the world’s most powerful individuals.

None of that should prevent a necessary and overdue debate from beginning in earnest in Brazil next month. In the UK, the refusal by both main parties to contemplate wealth taxes flies in the face both of popular sentiment and the needs of the country, following the economic shocks of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. But globally, the successful implementation of the minimum corporation tax suggests that an age in which footloose, mobile capital could please itself may be coming to an end.

States provide the healthcare, education and infrastructure that allow the very wealthy to make their money. Dodging the obligation to pay a fair share of the costs involved should not be an option. In seeking a declaration to that effect in July, Brazil will be doing the rest of the world a favour.","An aerial view of luxury yachts docked in a marina with buildings in the background, under the title 'The Guardian Opinions'.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BA5F43FD0>,2024-06-02 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/02/the-guardian-view-on-taxing-billionaires-we-need-to-talk-about-the-super-rich,['Politics' 'International' 'Opinion/Editorial'],[0.9 0.9 0.8],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/dec7b9ea49.png
f7d9eab95f,Global News Toronto,B.C. landlords win ruling to increase rent by 23.5% over two years - Global News Toronto,"Two Victoria B.C. landlords have been granted a rent increase above the amount that is legally allowed after it was found they were incurring a financial loss on a rental property.

The landlords purchased the property – their first rental property – on Oct. 28, 2021.

They had a variable rate mortgage at the time of 1.9 per cent. However, by June 2023, interest rates had gone up to 6.4 per cent and by July 2023, it was 6.65 per cent.

“In the last fiscal year, the impact on the financing costs incurred by the landlords because of the increased interest rates was $80,058.99. The landlords compared this figure to the interest payable in the previous fiscal year which was $45,722.44,” states the ruling from the Residential Tenancy Branch (RTB).

In April 2023, the landlords reached out to the tenants and asked if they would be agreeable to a rent increase of $500 a month but the tenants said no.

“Some tenants argued that this is the landlords’ investment, so how can this be classified as a loss when the landlords are ‘going to come away with a million dollar house,” the ruling reads.

The landlords said they were not able to lock into a fixed-rate mortgage due to sizeable penalties.

The landlords applied for a 23.5 per cent additional rent increase on top of the permitted annual rent increase of 3.5 per cent for a total rent increase of 27 per cent saying their current financial situation was unsustainable.

They told the RTB that they did not have a financial buffer and said that even with the increase, they were not going to break even.

The landlords’ rental units are two-bedroom one-bath suites. Utilities are included in the tenants’ rents, which are $1,282, $1,450, and $1,550. The landlord’s requested additional rent increase application would raise the rents in the residential property to $1,628.14, $1,841.50, and $1,968.50 per month.

“I find the landlord’s evidence about incurring a financial loss for the financing costs of purchasing the residential property could not have been foreseen under reasonable circumstances credible,” the ruling states.

“I find the world and economic events in reaction to the pandemic were not reasonably foreseeable and have impacted the landlords, despite them taking reasonable precautions by accessing a mortgage through a recognized and well-known lender. I find the landlords exercised care, foresight, judgment, financial prudence, and due diligence in purchasing and financing the residential property, but significant increases in the mortgage interest rate occurred due to unforeseen events.”

According to the ruling, the landlords said they have never applied for an additional rent increase and determined the total amount for this increase by considering the rental income loss they can manage.

“They determined that a net income loss of $10,000 was an amount they can accept, and would still allow them to retain the property.”

The ruling determined that the landlords have proven all the elements required to impose an additional rent increase for a financial loss.

“I find this rent increase significant in one installment, and I order it may be applied over two years,” the ruling states.

In a statement, Housing Minister Ravi Kahlon said that the government is taking action to fight the housing crisis and since 2018 they have kept rental increases at or below inflation.

“The policy that allows these kinds of exceptional rental increases because of financing is an old policy from the old government and this is the first time an application like this has been granted since we started collecting data in 2021,” he said.

“I know people have a lot of questions and I’ve directed staff to review this policy and how it impacts renters in the current context.”","An aerial view of a residential area with a mix of houses and apartment buildings, with a large multi-story building in the center.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BDA781150>,2024-08-16 00:46:15+00:00,https://globalnews.ca,https://globalnews.ca/news/10700468/bc-landlord-ruling-increase-rent-23-percent/,['Business and Finance' 'Local/Regional'],[0.9 0.9],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/f7d9eab95f.png

So, you think you know all about retinol–but how much do you really know? While you may love the vitamin A derivative for its acne-fighting and anti-aging properties, there’s much more to it.

Beauty expert Janine Holmes stopped by The Morning Show to share all the facts, including why retinol is hailed the holy grail of skincare and how to properly incorporate it into your routine.

Read on to discover everything you need to know about the powerhouse ingredient, plus some of our favourite formulas on the market. But first, time for a game of true or false.

Answer: False

Retinol is considered the holy grail of skincare for good reason. Nicknamed the “Anti-aging Superhero,” it fights more than wrinkles and fine lines; it also helps to reduce sunspots and hyperpigmentation. Its versatility makes it suitable for all skin types—whether your skin is dry or oily, retinol can address concerns like dullness and clogged pores, bringing balance and vitality back to your complexion.

Answer: False

“Good news: Hyaluronic acid and retinol are a match made in skincare heaven,” says Holmes. A true humectant, hyaluronic acid draws moisture into the skin, plumping up fine lines and wrinkles. You’ll want to invest in products that combine the powers of retinol and hyaluronic acid in one, like RoC’s Derm Correxion Fill and Treat Serum.

Answer: False

Retinol can be applied in the morning as well as in the evening. One caution: “When you are using a retinol product, you should always be using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least a rating of 15 or higher,” says Holmes, as retinol has been known to cause sensitivity to UV rays.

Answer: False

Retinol is a more cost-effective solution to your skin concerns than a trip to the dermatologist. Products containing the ingredients, like RoC’s retinol serum, can be purchased for as little as $40 online and at local retailers. Your skin and your wallet will thank you!

7d0e7f0a1a,The Guardian,Working-class parents do not see film and TV as viable career for their children - The Guardian,"Nine in 10 working-class parents would discourage their children from pursuing a career in film and television because they do not see it as a viable career, according to a report.

Research conducted by Netflix and the National Youth Theatre found that 89% of working-class parents would advise their children against trying to work in the industry because of the perception it is not a sustainable career.

The report, based on interviews with 500 National Youth Theatre participants and 2,000 parents and carers, found that “traditional” professions such as law, medicine and finance were seen as more attractive and safer bets for aspirational young people.

The Four Lions star and National Youth Theatre patron Adeel Akhtar is encouraging parents not to rule out a career in TV or film for their children.

His first exposure to acting came when his mother sent him to drama lessons, believing it would improve his diction. He then completed a law degree after being “pushed” into it by his father before forging a successful career as an actor.

Akhtar said: “If you’re coming from this context, or a situation which is a little bit precarious, you’re not going to encourage your kid to go into an industry that is high risk.”

The research shows there is still a strong class element at play in discussions between parents and their children about whether the arts is a suitable career path.

One in four respondents said their parents, guardians or carers were unsupportive of their creative endeavours, while just under 75% said their parents viewed their career choice as a waste of their education.

Akhtar believes that the cost of fewer working-class voices in TV and film would be a reduction in the kinds of inventive shows that have emerged in the last decade.

“Something like Atlanta that’s now on TV, we can’t unsee that,” he said. “It opens the doors for lots of people to talk about their lived experience, but space has to be made for people to feel like those stories are valid and worth telling.”

The new research is in line with other academic studies of what Netflix is calling the “class chasm” in the arts.

Research released in 2022 found that 16.4% of actors, musicians and writers born between 1953 and 1962 had a working-class background, but that had fallen to just 7.9% for those born four decades later.

Analysis released this year found that six in 10 of all arts and culture workers in the UK come from middle-class backgrounds. People from working-class families make up 8.4% of those working in film, TV, radio and photography, while in museums, archives and libraries, the proportion is only 5.2%.

The playwright James Graham used his MacTaggart lecture at the Edinburgh television festival to encourage the television industry to treat class in the same way it does other personal characteristics such as race or sexuality.

“If you see a person, or a character, who looks like you or sounds like you on screen, whose experience or dilemmas, or joy, reflects your own … you feel more seen,” he said. “There is a catharsis there, for audiences. A validation.”

Paul Roseby, the chief executive and artistic director of the National Youth Theatre, said there had been a sustained lack of investment in the arts which has contributed to parents feeling the creative industries were not a stable form of employment.

He said: “I talk about a reset or a renewal … on a truly national scale. We have a duty to really embed the value of why we do it, not just how great it is, but why [the arts] are so important for the national character.”","A man in a blue cap is standing in a field of white flowers, holding a plant with a serious expression.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BA3892C50>,2024-09-04 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/article/2024/sep/04/working-class-parents-do-not-see-film-and-tv-as-viable-career-for-their-children,['Entertainment' 'Opinion/Editorial' 'National'],[0.85 0.7  0.65],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/7d0e7f0a1a.png
d0038f13d2,National Review,The Lancet : You Are ‘Hardly Human’ If You Don’t Believe in the International Community - National Review,"The Lancet‘s editor in chief, Richard Horton, is furious at people who don’t believe in the international community. The “system” is failing, he says — and it’s the fault of evil right-wingers.

In a signed editorial in the world’s oldest medical journal, Horton bemoans the plight of Gazans and the fighting that has badly damaged hospitals — without once mentioning that Hamas terrorists hide and store lethal arms in these medical facilities or that they have stolen who-knows-how-many billions in aid over the years, directed at the Palestinian people, to construct intricate tunnel systems from which to attack Israel.

Then, Horton focuses on his real target. He blows a gasket while casting deep aspersions on skeptics of international institutions, particularly on those who participate in the Geneva Project. From “Offline: The system is not working“:

The prospects for this failing system look bleak. Donald Trump again as US President? The far right making electoral gains across Europe? Murderous political leaders able to act with impunity? Purveyors of disinformation, working under the rubric of The Geneva Project, who proclaim that, “We, people of the world, no longer abide by the tyrannical rule of unelected global officials and their vision of the future”? A collection of anti-vaxxers, right-wing activists, and conspiracy theorists gathered at the World Health Assembly on June 1 to declare their opposition to WHO’s efforts to negotiate a pandemic agreement.

I wasn’t aware of the Geneva Project’s work, but good for them. Reasonable people who believe in national sovereignty and individual liberty should oppose the pending pandemic agreement. The agreement would elevate the untrustworthy World Health Organization from an advisory institution to one with the power to declare an international health emergency, impose public-health policies on nations, and censor those who do not toe the party line. In other words, the agreement would enable the imposition of a technocracy.

Why, oh, why, Horton moans, are people so unwilling to docilely follow the lead of international institutions? The trite old standbys:

What is the cause of this breakdown of belief in an international community? There are many possible culprits. Racism. Populism. Nationalism.

Horton takes a hysterical step further, claiming that the system’s skeptics have lost their “humanity”:

But I think it was Dr Ghada who identified one especially important root cause: the loss of our humanity. The system is failing because our humanity—our compassion towards each other—has been eroded and, in some instances, erased. We are numb to one another’s pain. We refuse to see the distress of our neighbour. We turn away from the misery of others. We seem to be hardly human anymore.

No. It isn’t that people are “hardly human anymore.” Indeed, people care very deeply about the distress of their neighbors — such as the distress of children whose education was subverted, and of the grieving who couldn’t attend their loved ones’ funerals — because of public-health policies that we now know were not backed by “science,” as our would-be technocratic overlords then claimed.

In other words, the people’s loss of “belief” was the natural consequence of the international system’s failing and betraying those it was designed to serve. Indeed, if Horton wants to examine the many reasons behind our discontent, he should look in the mirror. The hubris of his rhetoric. The disdain he clearly holds for people with whose political and cultural views he disagrees. The two-dimensional thinking.

7ec3f01a55,The Guardian US,Ohio Republicans approve misleading ballot language to favor gerrymandering - The Guardian US,"Ohio voters could see an extremely misleading description of a proposal to curb extreme partisan gerrymandering on their November ballots after Republicans approved controversial language on Friday.

At issue is how to describe a proposal that would create a 15-person citizen commission to draw congressional and state legislative districts in Ohio. The commission – five Democrats, five Republicans and five independents – would be prohibited from drawing districts that “that favor one political party and disfavor others”.

But the language approved on Friday by the Republican-controlled Ohio ballot board misrepresents the proposal – instead leading voters to think they have less power in the process. It says the commissioners would be “required to gerrymander the boundaries of state legislative and congressional districts to favor the two largest political parties in the state of Ohio”.

The GOP-approved summary also misrepresents how difficult it would be to remove a commissioner from the panel, telling voters the proposal would “prevent a commission member from being removed, except by a vote of their fellow commission members, even for incapacity, willful neglect of duty or gross misconduct”.

But the proposal expressly says that commissioners can be removed from “wanton and willful neglect of duty or gross misconduct or malfeasance in office, incapacity or inability to perform his or her duties, or behavior involving moral turpitude or other acts that undermine the public’s trust in the commission and the redistricting process”. It says that only the commission can remove a commissioner after giving public notice and holding a hearing with public comment.

Supporters of the amendment, a coalition called Citizens not Politicians, said they would sue over the language in the Ohio supreme court next week.

“It’s one grotesque abuse of power after another from politicians desperate to protect the current system that only benefits themselves and their lobbyist friends,” said Maureen O’Connor, a Republican who recently retired from the state supreme court and helped draft the amendment. “Do the politicians not see how angry voters are when they keep breaking the law to protect their own power? Secretary of State Frank LaRose voted seven times for maps that courts ruled were unconstitutional, and this week he violates the constitution with objectively false ballot language. It’s a desperate abuse of power, and it’s not going to work.”

Ohio’s current districts are heavily tilted in favor of the GOP and Republicans defied several rulings from the state supreme court to make the districts more fair. Republicans also unsuccessfully sought to make it nearly impossible to pass a constitutional amendment last summer.

The language approved on Friday, reportedly drafted by Ohio’s secretary of state, Frank LaRose, also says the measure would “repeal constitutional protections against gerrymandering approved by nearly three quarters of Ohio electors participating in the statewide elections of 2015 and 2018”. While Ohio voters did approve anti-gerrymandering reforms in those years, Republicans ignored them when they redrew districts after the 2020 census. Organizers drafted the amendment pushing for the independent commission after Republicans were able to keep gerrymandered districts in place in 2022.

93e8932b59,New York Post,We tried it: Scarlett Johansson’s skincare delivers simplicity and efficacy - New York Post,"As someone who has navigated a myriad of skincare products on the market, I approached Scarlett Johansson’s skincare line, The Outset, with a mix of curiosity and skepticism.

RELATED: Shop the best clean makeup brands, per experts

In a world saturated with celebrity beauty brands, it’s easy to wonder if there’s room for another. However, The Outset stands out by embracing simplicity and efficacy, making it a compelling choice for skincare enthusiasts.

What is The Outset?

The Outset, co-founded by Johansson and beauty executive Kate Foster, is built on the principle of starting with the basics.

The skincare line launched with a curated selection of five essential products, each designed to address common skincare concerns like dullness and dryness. This minimalist approach is a refreshing departure from the overwhelming 10-step routines that have become the norm.

With a wide product selection, you’ll find everything from SPF to a Cool Cream for sun exposure and recovery, as well as a Clay Mask and a Barrier Balm for total skin rejuvenation and protection.

One of the standout products for me is the Nourishing Squalane Daily Moisturizer. Infused with The Outset’s signature Hyaluroset Complex, it’s perfect for when I want a lightweight, non-greasy base for makeup application. The Gentle Micellar Antioxidant Cleanser is another gem. For someone with dry, sensitive skin, it’s a godsend, as it avoids harsh ingredients and focuses on gentle but thorough cleansing.

Before I get ahead of myself, scroll on to discover what’s different about The Outset and how it performed through testing.

Nourishing Squalane Daily Moisturizer

This is a lightweight moisturizer infused with The Outset’s signature Hyaluroset Complex, designed to provide lasting hydration without leaving a greasy residue. After using the Nourishing Squalane Daily Moisturizer, my dry skin feels instantly hydrated and smooth.

The lightweight texture absorbs quickly, making it an excellent base for makeup. I appreciate that it doesn’t leave any sticky feeling, which is a common issue with other moisturizers I’ve tried. Best of all, the hydration lasts all day somehow — and, for that, it’s a holy grail product for me now.

Gentle Micellar Antioxidant Cleanser

This micellar-based cleanser effectively removes makeup and impurities while being gentle on the skin, which is ideal for sensitive skin types. Using the Gentle Micellar Antioxidant Cleanser is a refreshing experience. It removes my makeup effortlessly without leaving my skin feeling stripped or dry. As someone with sensitive skin, I found it soothing and non-irritating. I especially love the texture of the product — I’m a sucker for a foaming cleanser, but my dry skin usually means I can’t use them. That’s not the case with The Outset’s cleanser. This reminds me…I’m nearly out and need to re-up.

Smoothing Vitamin C Eye + Expression Lines Cream

Enriched with vitamin C, this eye cream is aimed at brightening dark circles and reducing the appearance of fine lines. It quickly has become a staple in my morning routine. It brightens my under-eye area and works well under concealer without causing crepiness. The hydrating formula is a definite plus, as it allows me to use my most pigmented makeup under my eyes without any issues.

How We Tested

Some background on my skin: I have dehydrated, somewhat sensitive skin. I am a survivor of severe acne and still get the occasional breakout every once in a while if a product is too complex, comedogenic, or if it’s that time of the month.

To evaluate The Outset skincare line, I incorporated each product into my daily routine over the course of three months. This allowed for a comprehensive assessment of product performance and compatibility with various skin concerns.

Application: Each product was applied according to its intended use: cleanser in the morning and evening, moisturizer after cleansing, and eye cream as part of my morning routine.

Observations: I carefully noted changes in my skin’s texture, hydration, and overall appearance, paying particular attention to any signs of irritation or improvement in targeted areas like under the eyes.

Comparisons: I compared the results with other similar products I’ve used in the past to gauge effectiveness and user experience.

The testing process focused on real-world applications to ensure the products delivered on their promises of simplicity and efficacy.

The verdict

What sets The Outset apart is its commitment to clean beauty. All products are vegan, cruelty-free, and formulated without common irritants like synthetic fragrances, gluten, and nut allergens. This makes the line suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin, which is a significant plus for those prone to irritation (hi!).

After a month of using The Outset products, I noticed a visible improvement in my skin’s texture and hydration levels, which is more than I expected and maybe even more than I deserve (it’s that good). The line’s focus on fewer, high-quality ingredients means each product serves a purpose without overwhelming the epidermis. It’s a testament to Johansson’s vision of creating a skincare line that is both effective and accessible.

In a market crowded with celebrity skincare lines, The Outset is a breath of fresh air. Its emphasis on simplicity, clean ingredients, and universal appeal makes it a worthy addition to any skincare routine. Whether you’re a skincare novice or a seasoned pro, it offers a straightforward path to healthier, glowing skin. In truth, it’s going to take a lot for me to want to test other skincare brands after this one.

5177abb96c,CNN,European Parliament elections: What’s at stake in the world’s biggest multi-country vote - CNN,"One of the world’s largest democratic exercises is underway, with some 373 million people across the European Union eligible to vote in elections for the next European Parliament.

Voters in the 27 nations of the EU head to the polls from Thursday to Sunday to elect 720 members of the parliament, which will play a crucial role in shaping the priorities and political direction of the bloc for the next five years.

The vote comes at a pivotal moment for the EU, which is grappling with issues ranging from the wars in Ukraine and Gaza to immigration and climate change. Polls have predicted big gains for hard-right parties in a number of countries, which could have long-term implications for the continent.

Here’s what you need to know about the world’s biggest multi-country election.

How do the elections work?

The elections are held over four days every five years in June. This year, they are taking place between June 6 and 9.

They are held over multiple days because, despite being elections to an EU institution, they are still arranged and managed as national ballots by each of the EU’s 27 member states. In some countries, they may all be held on a single day, whereas others take place over several days.

Because the elections are managed at a national level, they are not all carried out in the same exact way. However, they must all employ a proportional representation system –where the number of lawmakers elected to the parliament directly correlates to the percentage of people who voted for them.

Once all the votes have been counted, each national political party will be assigned a number of members of European Parliament (MEPs) relative to their vote share. It is up to the member states to determine how this is assigned.

Once they have been appointed to the parliament, MEPs can then join a European political party, which allows them to sit in a group in the parliament. These parties and groupings are multinational and based on a loose set of shared beliefs. The bigger the grouping, the more influence it has in parliament.

Results will start to come in late on Sunday, but full results will not be known until at least Monday.

What’s the point of the European Parliament and what do MEPs do?

The European Parliament sits primarily in Brussels, Belgium, but moves roughly once a month to Strasbourg, France. It is the legislative branch of the EU and one of the bloc’s three main institutions – along with the European Commission, which is the executive branch, and the European Council, which is made up of ministers from the governments of the 27 member states.

It is the only EU institution where representatives are directly elected, and MEPs pass laws which are applied all over the bloc. In order for any legislation to be implemented, both the council and parliament have to agree.

One of the parliament’s most crucial roles is approving the makeup of the commission, which is ultimately responsible for the political direction of the world’s largest trading bloc, and it has the final say on who is appointed as president of the commission. Currently the top job is filled by Germany’s Ursula von der Leyen, who is seeking a second term at the helm.

The parliament also has ultimate approval over the billions of euros allocated in the EU budget. It often has the final word on major policy issues such as the budget, trade and sanctions on foreign nationals.

The parliament can also put major international objectives in the deep freeze. For example, A comprehensive mutual investment agreement between the EU and China is effectively on hold while some MEPs are under sanctions from China. The parliament as a whole has refused to advance the agreement until the sanctions are lifted.

What are the biggest issues in this vote?

Since this week’s election is in effect 27 individual national elections, some issues are in play in some countries but not in others.

Broadly speaking, immigration, climate change, security and support for Ukraine are issues that matter across the bloc.

While irregular migration figures are lower than they were during the 2015-2016 refugee crisis, it is still a sensitive issue across the EU, as some countries bear a disproportionate share of the burden while others are loathe to do their part.

Slowing the effects of climate change and making Europe greener has been a priority for a long time. However, some countries now balk at the cost of cutting fossil fuel emissions.

The EU is largely united on its support for Ukraine, but that too could be affected if populists like France’s Marine Le Pen are elected to lead national governments.

What are the political groupings?

If the 720 MEPs representing 27 countries and hundreds of different domestic political parties were all left to their own devices, things would get very complicated.

To simplify the work of the parliament, leaders of national governments form alliances with each other based on their shared political beliefs – the European political parties.

If a politician is a member of, for example, French President Emmanuel Macron’s Renaissance party in France, he or she will stand for that party as an MEP at a national level. If they are then elected to the European Parliament, they will join the centrist, liberal European party, Renew Europe – which currently has members from 24 of the 27 EU members. Once seated in parliament, they will sit alongside the other MEPs from Renew parties in other countries as a political grouping.

There are seven main groupings, ranging from the extremes of the far right to the far left.

The two dominant groupings are the center-right conservative European People’s Party (EPP) and the center-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D). Due to proportional representation, no single group has anything resembling a majority and therefore they must form broad coalitions to get anything done in parliament. The EPP and S&D (or their previous incarnations) have dominated this coalition for decades.

While these two parties are still expected to be the largest after the elections, all eyes are on the other main right-wing groups, the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and the hard-right, populist Identity and Democracy (ID).

What’s likely to happen in the election?

It is expected that the EPP and S&D centrist coalition will largely hold.

However, it is also expected that ECR and ID will make significant gains that result in more power in the next parliament.

The two hard-right parties have not said they will work together and the leaderships of the two groups are known to dislike each other. Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister and president of the ECR bloc, has an eye on working with the mainstream right at an EU level, for instance.

During the 2022 Italian general election, much was made of Meloni’s right-wing rhetoric. She was a hardliner on immigration, and had questioned LGBTQ+ rights, among other things.

However, since winning she has been pragmatic in working with those in power at a European level – most notably von der Leyen, the commission’s president, who is herself a member of the more mainstream EPP. Von der Leyen even went so far as to visit the Italian island of Lampedusa, which has been an arrival point for large numbers of irregular migrants, to set out a 10-point EU plan to support Italy with the influx.

Critics say that Meloni has sold out; supporters say that she has played her cards perfectly and managed to pull the EU’s center in her direction. Evidence of this might be the EU having finally agreed a deal earlier this year on how it would share the weight of irregular migration, after years of deadlock and negotiation.

How could the election affect European politics?

The possibility that the EU’s political center might be up for grabs is the most important context of these elections. The opaque and fluid nature of politics at a European level means that a lot can change over the course of a five-year period.

Between the EPP and S&D, there might be a centrist coalition on day one of this new parliament. But these are not formal coalitions, rather loose alliances that vote together, issue by issue. This is where the idea of a right-wing ECR and ID axis becomes significant.

The rise of the far-right’s influence in European Parliament follows a similar trend at the national level in a number of major EU member states.

National elections are set to take place in France in 2027, in which right-wing populist Le Pen could emerge victorious. She is the chair of ID and has recently made obvious efforts to detoxify the bloc by expelling lawmakers from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) from its ranks following accusations of antisemitism.

A victory in the French presidential election would of course make Le Pen a much bigger major player in European politics. That might not mean any formal coalition between the center-right EPP and ID, but the politics of the European Parliament is a sliding scale of sorts and, if France shifts right, it’s fair to say the center-right will take note.

There are EPP members (and certainly ECR members) who will agree with ID members on matters such as immigration and climate change. When those issues come up and the parliament has a role to play, it’s not implausible that the ECR and ID could then put huge pressure on EPP lawmakers to vote the same way.

It is, after all, always worth remembering that these people must still answer to their domestic voters, who can sack them at the next election.","A large room filled with people seated at desks, facing a central podium, with multiple screens displaying information, indicative of a European Parliament session.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA4C4BA00>,2024-06-06 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/06/europe/european-parliament-elections-2024-explained-intl/index.html,['Politics' 'International'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/5177abb96c.png
b36a4a105e,USA TODAY,Trump jury requests on trial transcript and instructions offer clues on deliberations - USA TODAY,"LIVE UPDATES: Jury reaches verdict in Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial

NEW YORK − Requests from the jury in former President Donald Trump's hush money trial to hear specific portions of the trial transcript and their instructions from the judge Thursday offer clues about their ongoing deliberations.

Judge Juan Merchan said jurors wanted to hear a description of how they should consider evidence and what inferences may be drawn from it, as well as instructions on New York law. A note from jurors specifically mentioned an example the judge described about inferring it's raining when people are wearing rain gear and using umbrellas.

Jurors also want a headphone jack to listen to recordings. Merchan said headphones or a speaker could be provided.

Merchan read pages six through 35 of the jury instructions. You can read the instructions here:

Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.

Trial transcript: What did jurors ask to review?

Jurors asked to listen to these four portions of the trial transcript read aloud:

Testimony from David Pecker, the former head of the parent company for the National Enquirer tabloid, about a phone conversation with Trump while Pecker was in an investor meeting;

Pecker's testimony regarding the decision not to finalize and fund the assignment of former Playboy model Karen McDougal's life rights;

Pecker's testimony regarding a Trump Tower meeting he said he had with Trump and former Trump attorney Michael Cohen in August of 2015; and

Cohen's testimony regarding that same Trump Tower meeting.

What are these transcript sections about?

David Pecker testified during Trump's historic hush money trial trial that he agreed in an August 2015 meeting with Trump and Cohen to be ""the eyes and ears"" when it came to catching stories from women that threatened to get out and hurt Trump's presidential campaign. Pecker said he agreed to notify Cohen, at which point Cohen and Trump would be responsible for buying the stories or otherwise killing them.

Pecker also said that, during a call he had with Trump during an investor meeting, he recommended buying McDougal's story of an affair with Trump. Pecker testified that he believed her story was true.

Pecker also told jurors that, after having a conversation with a lawyer, he told Cohen he didn't want to get paid back or sell the rights to McDougal's story, which the media company that Pecker ran had purchased.

What are jurors discussing?

Jury deliberations are private. But the jurors' request to listen to portions of the trial transcript offers some clues about what they may be discussing.

Prosecutors charged Trump with felonies based on the theory that Trump falsified records to cover up a conspiracy to unlawfully influence the 2016 election. The August 2015 meeting is a core moment when prosecutors say that conspiracy took shape. Jurors' interest in that meeting could mean they are discussing whether there was such a conspiracy.

One of the prosecution's theories for how co-conspirators tried to unlawfully influence the election is by violating federal campaign finance laws through a $130,000 hush money payment from Cohen to porn star Stormy Daniels.

The McDougal hush money deal is totally separate, but the prosecution argued it's important context for understanding the wider alleged conspiracy. Jurors' interest in Pecker's testimony on that deal and his recommendation to Trump could mean they are looking at the degree of evidence supporting Trump's participation in a conspiracy.

When Pecker testified that he didn't want to sell the McDougal story to Trump or Cohen after talking with a lawyer, he seemed to suggest he had legal concerns about it. Jurors could be considering this testimony to gauge whether Trump would have known that Cohen's hush money payment to Daniels was illegal. That would be relevant to whether Trump falsified records concerning his alleged reimbursement to Cohen in to cover up a separate crime.","A man in a suit and tie sits at a table with his hands clasped, surrounded by a courtroom setting with other individuals in suits and police officers standing in the background.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA4248130>,2024-05-30 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.usatoday.com,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/05/30/donald-trump-jury-deliberations-questions/73905514007/,['Politics' 'National'],[0.85 0.75],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/b36a4a105e.png

fc50027586,Forbes,India End Cricket Curse After Beating South Africa To Win T20 World Cup - Forbes,"Rohit Sharma lay on the field and punched the Kensington Oval turf several times. Being captain of mighty India, cricket's undisputed powerhouse, is an uncompromising role with the hopes and dreams of a billion people piled on your back.

The scrutiny is always at 100% and Rohit, like everyone else who has filled these big shoes, has been numerously a punching bag. An ashen-faced Rohit looked like he saw a ghost in the aftermath of India losing a home final to Australia at last year's 50-over World Cup.

But all the angst and toil bubbled over when a sprawled and emotional Rohit realized he had led India to the T20 World Cup title after a tense seven-run win over South Africa.

Cricket's most baffling curse is over, with India ending an 11-year drought across formats. It was just their second T20 World Cup title having won the inaugural edition in 2007 - a triumph that changed cricket's course forever with the shorter T20 format gaining a foothold.

Mighty India are simply cricket's powerhouse on-and-off the field. They have the type of deep reservoir of talent, from a bottomless pool, that is the envy of every other nation.

India has been the most consistent team across formats over the last decade, but with no titles to show off.

They are something like the U.S. in basketball where all eyes are on them every time they play. Only winning is acceptable, everything else is deemed a failure from their totally devoted followers and bombastic media.

Even finances skewed in their favor hadn't helped them. India's governing body has a $6 billion media rights deal for the Indian Premier League and receives close to 40% of the revenue share from the International Cricket Council's new $3 billion broadcast deal.

The final was a microcosm of India's heft in a sport whose finances remain almost totally dependant on the world's most populous nation that just happens to be cricket obsessed.

Cricket might be venturing into the U.S. in a bid to find a new money-spinning market, but India's stranglehold of the sport was underlined by the final in Barbados being played at the strange time of 10.30am. The reason being that the match was being beamed back to an audience in the hundreds of millions in India during prime time at 8.30pm.

Amid such an early start, those in the crowd were probably just shrugging off morning grogginess, the atmosphere felt rather subdued given the magnitude of the event. Not being a night fixture also made it look less aesthetically pleasing, but the contest luckily made up for all of that.

Both teams, who had romped to the final unbeaten, got what they wanted. India batted first as their penchant, while South Africa didn't mind as their slew of heavy-hitters prefer mowing down a total.

Rohit had been perhaps the most influential figure in the tournament, batting ultra aggressively in a selfless act in a bid to set a tone. There had been some speculation before the World Cup that Rohit and superstar Virat Kohli were on the outer in the format after a weary India's humiliating exit in Australia two years ago.

But, predictably, India's hierarchy stuck with the legends in what might just be their last World Cup appearances. It appeared perhaps destiny that Rohit was going to impose his will much like he did against fellow powerhouse Australia, who were clobbered by the inspired India captain and shockingly dumped from the tournament.

Rohit had been out for revenge all tournament after the heartbreak of last year's World Cup final. But he fell in the second over and Rishabh Pant was dismissed two balls later forcing Kohli, who had endured a miserable tournament up to this point, to play sedately.

Kohli's detractors were sharpening their knives after he posted his slowest ever T20I half-century. But Kohli, who after the match revealed he was retiring from T20Is, ignited after that to ensure India posted a competitive score and put the pressure back on South Africa, who were out to end three decades of misery at World Cups.

It was a see-saw of a chase with South Africa on track for a stunning upset until Jasprit Bumrah, arguably India's greatest ever pace bowler, bowled a delivery from the cricket gods to knock over Marco Jansen in the 18th over and India could not be stopped from there.

It was just a matter of time before India celebrated in jubilation and claimed their rightful place at the top of the cricket tree. With their supreme cricket boss Jay Shah basking in the glory, only adding to their all-powerful flex, this might just be the start of India's domination that has long felt inevitable.

You can take this to the bank - India won't be waiting another decade for a title.","An Indian cricket player, wearing a blue jersey with 'HARDIK' and the number '33', is seen celebrating with another player, both are in action during a cricket match.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BA2A0FCD0>,2024-06-29 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.forbes.com,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tristanlavalette/2024/06/29/india-end-cricket-curse-after-beating-south-africa-to-win-t20-world-cup/,['Sports' 'National'],[0.95 0.8 ],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/fc50027586.png

In New York Attorney General Letitia James' lawsuit that she filed last year, James alleges that Trump, his adult sons, and top executives at The Trump Organization, conspired to increase his net worth by billions of dollars on financial statements provided to banks and insurers to make deals and secure loans. Trump, the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, has denied any wrongdoing and has said the trial is politically motivated. During the course of the trial, Trump has made repeated attacks on judges and court staff, often taking to Truth Social, his social media platform, to voice his stance, which caused him to be issued gag orders. The former president attacked Judge Arthur Engoron's, who is overseeing the case, longtime law clerk, Alison Greenfield, on social media, which made Engoron fine him twice after the insults. More recently, Engoron's wife has also been at the center of Trump's attacks after she was accused of posting derogatory claims about the former president. She has denied these allegations. In early November, a state appellate court judge temporarily froze two gag orders that Engoron imposed on Trump. The appellate court lifted them until it heard a full appeal from Trump's lawyers, who wanted the gag orders removed.

He added: ""Now Trump is trying to test the waters, trying to see if he can get the judge to provoke some sort of fight with him over trying to protect his wife, something that makes it seem a little more personal.

He added: ""It certainly should impact how the defendants make statements that arguably fall under the order, but there is a high likelihood of a violation occurring. The big, open issue may be what penalties, if any, can be effective if and when Trump violates the order."" In an interview with MSNBC last week, former federal prosecutor and legal analyst Glenn Kirschner, a staunch Trump critic, spoke about the former president's repeated attacks while explaining that the judges in Trump's cases have a responsibility to pay attention to the ongoing ""witness threatening conduct"" Trump incites, warning that his ""luck may run out."" ""I think it would be irresponsible for one jurisdiction to decline to pay attention to the potentially witness threatening conduct by the same pretrial defendant in another jurisdiction and we have seen some cross pollination between and among the judges. I can only wonder if at some point Donald Trump's luck will run out and the judges will say enough, we are going to impose these gag orders, we are going to keep them in place,"" he said.",A man in a blue suit and tie is surrounded by police officers in a courtroom setting.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BA1167B50>,2023-12-03 17:00:08+00:00,https://www.newsweek.com,https://www.newsweek.com/legal-analyst-predicts-inevitable-defeat-donald-trumps-new-york-trial-1849060,['Politics' 'National'],[0.9 0.7],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/ae59a9509e.png
20de08e95b,Forbes,Inside VITAC’s Role In Making The Democratic National Convention ‘The Most Accessible’ In History - Forbes,"This year’s Democratic National Convention (DNC) is happening at Chicago’s United Center this week. The opening night festivities included speeches from Golden State Warriors and Team USA men’s basketball head coach Steve Kerr, Hillary Clinton, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and President Biden. I saw bits and pieces of every speech last night; as a disabled American voter, I’m keenly interested in finding out how the Harris-Walz ticket plans to support the disability community should they win the White House over Donald Trump come early November.

One aspect of the DNC you likely won’t hear anything about in most, if not all, mainstream news coverage is the accessibility of it. My friend and colleague Sara Luterman at The 19th News wrote an extensive piece on this very topic earlier this month, noting the DNC does feature “new wide-ranging considerations” for greater accessibility for the 850 attendees with disabilities, which include 560 delegates who identify as disabled. Robin Jones, accessibility advisor to the Democratic National Convention Committee, told Luterman in part the DNC Committee is “trying to be inclusive of everyone’s needs” while adding there are a “variety of different people with different disabilities attending.”

Captioning company VITAC, who’s been covered in this column before, put out a press release earlier this week ahead of the DNC kicking off where it announced it was enhancing accessibility at the event by way of live, multi-language captions, dubbing, and audio descriptions. The company touts its contribution in the lede, writing it is playing an “important role” in shaping this year’s DNC “the most accessible in the DNC’s history.” VITAC notes it is the “largest provider of captioning products and services in North America” and added it has a “long, successful history” of making governmental and other political events accessible to the disability constituency. VITAC, it boasted, was one of the first companies to being live captioning to such conventions as the DNC; it captioned the 1988 Democratic National Convention in Atlanta.

In a brief interview with me conducted earlier this week, VITAC general manager Doug Karlovits explained the DNC made a commitment to “put on the most accessible convention in history” and said it was imperative that Kamala Harris’ message be spread to “as many Americans as possible.” In order to realize its grand vision, the DNC sought a partner who possessed both the experiential and technical chops to help make it happen. That perfect partner, of course, was found in the VITAC team.

“It’s a pretty big undertaking,” Karlovits said of the work to make the DNC accessible to all. “It’s all being done remotely, and we have a direct feed to the United Center’s audio. We’re providing live English captions and live audio description for DNC viewers across all their different streaming channels and broadcast outlets. Our translators and voiceover artists are providing live English-to-Spanish dubbing on the fly during the convention while our multilingual captioners, listening and working directly from that dubbed audio, are providing live Spanish captions.”

In a nod to equality, Karlovits told me Deaf and hard-of-hearing people “increasingly want and expect access to” things like the DNC—or live sporting events or even a Taylor Swift concert. Ensuring such events are accessible to all, he said, guarantees everyone, regardless of ability, will be able to enjoy them. Specific to the Deaf and hard-of-hearing community, Karlovits noted accommodations such as ASL interpretation and captions are “essential to understanding spoken content.” Likewise, things like audio descriptions as equally essential to Blind and low vision people in terms of understanding information that’s presented visually.

Karlovits said the cries for accessibility is part of a “broader movement” towards equality and inclusivity regarding access to information. Slowly but surely, the disability community is getting its due—deservedly so.

“By providing accessible services, organizers not only comply with legal requirements but also recognize the importance of including all community members in important societal and political conversations,” he said. “This helps foster a more equitable society where everyone can engage with and contribute to key discussions and decisions.”

When asked what VITAC’s goals are for this week, Karlovits said the company is “thrilled” accessibility has been thrust onto such a big stage. This means a lot to Karlovits and crew from a business standpoint, but especially as an advocate for and ally of the disability community. VITAC’s overarching goal, he said, has always been to “provide the highest quality access services for the communities that rely on them.”

“We love the fact that in all walks of life and across multiple industries—whether it be education, corporate, government, or legal—we’re seeing people recognize the benefits of accessibility and take proactive steps for inclusion,” Karlovits said of the moral of the DNC’s inclusion story.",A large crowd at the Democratic National Convention with a stage featuring a sign that reads 'DNC 2024' and a large screen displaying a hugging couple.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BC762D690>,2024-08-20 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.forbes.com,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenaquino/2024/08/20/inside-vitacs-role-in-making-the-democratic-national-convention-the-most-accessible-in-history/,['Politics' 'Other'],[0.95 0.85],Unlikely,Likely,sample_review/images/20de08e95b.png
3cac826bd8,ABC News,Senate Democrats are polling well. That could help Biden. - ABC News,"As Democrats wring their hands over their poor polling numbers in the presidential race, there is one spot of good news for them: U.S. Senate races. Democratic candidates have led in most recent polls of key Senate races like Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin* even as President Joe Biden trails former President Donald Trump in the very same polls.

I went back and looked at every state-level poll that has asked about both the presidential race and a U.S. Senate race over the past six weeks. The table below shows a simple average of these polls by state; as you can see, Senate Democrats are outrunning Biden's margin by an average of 5 percentage points:

It isn't hard to figure out why this is the case. Stop me if you've heard this before, but Biden is unpopular; meanwhile, most Democratic candidates for Senate are popular incumbents, like Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, and/or have a track record of outperforming the top of the ticket, like Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Lo and behold, the only three states where Republican Senate candidates are polling better than Trump are the two states where they are incumbents (Florida and Texas) and Maryland, where the GOP's candidate is popular former Gov. Larry Hogan, who had an astounding 81 percent approval rating among Democrats at the time he left office.

So it's not exactly a mystery why there's a presidential-downballot gap. The more interesting question is what, if anything, that gap means for November. There are basically three theories to answer that:

1. Biden's support right now is artificially low; there are plenty of traditionally Democratic voters who are telling pollsters they support Senate Democrats but, for whatever reason, aren't ready to get behind Biden yet. So Biden's support will rise as we get closer to the election and those voters get on board, leaving both Biden and Senate Democrats in good shape.

2. Senate Republicans' support right now is artificially low. Since most of them aren't incumbents, they aren't as well known as their opponents, but their support will rise as Trump voters learn that they are on the ""right team"" in these Senate races. Therefore, both Trump and Senate Republicans will do well in November.

3. Senate Democrats are just more popular than Biden, and this gap will persist through the election: Many states will vote for both Trump and a Democratic Senate candidate.

Right off the bat, I'm skeptical of No. 3. If the current polls end up being exactly correct, Democrats would win at least five Senate races in states Trump carries. That wouldn't have been unusual 20 years ago — in 2004, seven states voted for different parties for president and for Senate. But today, split-ticket voting is quite rare. In 2016, every state voted for the same party for Senate that it did for president, and in 2020, every state but one (Maine) did.

The median difference between the presidential and Senate margins in a state has also shrunk drastically over that time — from 20 points in 2004 to just 3 points in 2020.

By comparison, the median difference between the current presidential and Senate polling margins in the 10 states in the table above is 10 points. It's just really hard to imagine that happening in such a polarized political environment.

So if we assume that the presidential and Senate results are eventually going to come into closer alignment, we're left with the question of which party that will benefit. And to answer that, we need to look beyond just the Democratic-Republican margins in recent polls to the actual percentage of the vote that Biden and Trump are getting compared with Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans.

You see, something that margins obscure is the fact that some voters are still undecided at this early juncture — and looking at actual percentages can give you a clue about who those voters might eventually be inclined to support.

Imagine State X, where Trump leads Biden 43 percent to 39 percent — a margin of 4 points — but the Democratic Senate candidate leads the Republican Senate candidate 47 percent to 41 percent — a margin of 6 points. That’s a 10-point difference in the margin, but it’s not because 10 percent of the voters in this state are splitting their tickets between Trump and the Democratic Senate candidate. Instead, Trump and the Republican Senate candidate have roughly the same level of support: around 42 percent. But the Democratic Senate candidate is running almost 9 points ahead of Biden, 47 percent to 39 percent, indicating that a lot of people voting Democratic for Senate haven’t decided who they’re voting for at the top of the ticket yet.

It's plausible that these people could vote for either Biden or Trump in the end; undecided voters, by definition, could go either way. But it is easier to imagine them voting for Biden because they have already expressed willingness to vote for a Democrat — and, again, split-ticket voting has become as rare as platinum. So this scenario would give Democrats reason for optimism.

Well, luckily for Democrats, this is a real scenario: State X is Arizona. And it's a similar story in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin so far — almost all of the presidential-Senate discrepancy in the polls there is accounted for by Biden's soft support among Democratic Senate voters. There's no guarantee that he'll be able to do it, but if Biden can just win over every supporter of Casey, Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego and Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin,** he has a good chance of erasing his deficit in those states.

On the other hand, the news is worse for Biden in other states. Biden has lots of room to grow in Nevada as well, where he is polling 9 points behind Sen. Jacky Rosen. But likely Republican nominee Sam Brown is also polling 6 points behind Trump, and if both of them catch up to the leader, the Silver State would be roughly tied, 45 percent to 44 percent.

Meanwhile, in Michigan, it's actually Biden and Slotkin who are polling at the same level (42 percent). Likely Republican nominee former Rep. Mike Rogers, though, is underperforming Trump by 3 points, implying that he could pull ahead of Slotkin in Senate polling once Republicans start learning who he is.

This is, of course, an oversimplified exercise; again, these undecided voters aren't guaranteed to break uniformly for the party that they've expressed support for elsewhere on the ticket. In fact, they're almost certain to not break uniformly — that is, some will vote for the same party for president and Senate, but others will split their ticket.

And, crucially, there are still lots of voters who are undecided about their votes for both president and Senate. Look back at the table above; only two numbers in it are above 50 percent (the 51 percent of Floridians who support Republican Sen. Rick Scott and the 55 percent of Marylanders who support Biden). So even if every not-Biden Democrat and every not-Republican-senator Trump supporter comes home in the end, the election in most states is going to come down to which way a more unpredictable group of voters breaks — the truly undecided.

d428967ff0,The Guardian US,Kamala Harris allies deploy new Trump attack line: he is ‘just plain weird’ | US elections 2024 - The Guardian US,"US Democrats have spent recent days trying out a relatively new attack line on Donald Trump: that he is weird. The tactic is almost certainly calibrated to resonate with young and independent voters who, polls show, are moving from marked lack of interest in the now-dropped matchup between Joe Biden and his presidential predecessor to engagement in the 100-day contest between Trump and Kamala Harris.

In a press release on Thursday, the vice-president and presumptive Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, issued a list of the main takeaways of what Trump had given the American people. “Is Donald Trump OK?” the X message said. The seventh of nine entries was: “Trump is old and quite weird?”

At a fundraising event in Massachusetts on Saturday, Harris tried out the line again, describing what Trump and running mate JD Vance had been saying about her as “just plain weird”.

“I mean that’s the box you put that in,” Harris said after Trump had called her “a bum” the previous day and Vance disparaged her in 2021 as a “childless cat (lady)”.

The Harris campaign, working to redefine the race with particular attention to the youth vote, including colorizing online HarrisHQ banners lime green after Charli xcx’s “brat” endorsement, has sought to draw attention to Trump’s rally storytelling. Particularly, they have highlighted his frequent references to the fictional serial killer Hannibal Lecter of The Silence of the Lambs fame as well as the choice between being shocked by a sinking electric boat or being eaten by a shark.

But “weird” is what seems to be sticking, in part as an apparent simplification of warnings about the threat to democracy that Trump poses – which dominated 15 months of Biden’s re-election campaign.

Minnesota’s Democratic governor, Tim Walz, appears to have started the “weird” political trendline. He posted on X, “Say it with me: Weird,” in response to a video of Trump speaking about Lecter. Walz later followed up with “these guys are weird” to describe Trump and Vance.

During a Sunday appearance on CNN’s State of the Union, Walz was asked if “weird” had replaced existential threat to democracy as a more effective attack strategy. The retired high school educator and football coach replied: “It’s an observation because being a schoolteacher I see a lot of things.”

Walz added that a second Trump presidency could indeed put women’s lives at risk over reproductive rights after three of his US supreme court appointees helped eliminate federal abortion rights in 2022. He also said Trump could end other constitutional liberties – but musing about his embodiment of a threat to democracy “gives him way too much power”, Walz argued.

“Listen to the guy. He’s talking about Hannibal Lecter and shocking sharks and whatever crazy thing pops into his mind,” Walz said.

“I think we give him way too much credit. If you just ratchet down some of the scariness and just name it what it is. Have you seen the guy laugh? It seems very weird to me that an adult can go through six and a half years of being in the public eye and when he laughs it’s at someone – not with them.

“That’s very weird behavior,” Walz explained on State of the Union. “I don’t think you call it anything else. It’s simply what we’re observing.”

The US transport secretary, Pete Buttigieg, also an outside contender for Harris’s vice-president pick, tried a slightly amended line, telling Fox News that Trump is “clearly older and stranger than when America first got to know him”.

The 78-year-old Trump’s campaign, he added, had maintained its candidate “is strong as an ox, leaps tall buildings in … bounds, but we don’t have that kind of warped reality on our side”.

“I’m pretty sure voters are worried about the age and acuity of President Trump compared to Kamala Harris, who represents being a generation younger,” Buttigieg said. “And how could anybody not watch the stuff he’s saying, the rambling on the trail, and not be just a little bit concerned?”

The new Democratic line on Trump comes after several days of criticism aimed at Vance not only about the “childless cat” lady comment – but also because of reportedly resurfaced comments calling Trump “morally reprehensible” and expressing his hatred for police officers, who generally enjoy the support of Republicans.

The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, described Vance’s selection as an “incredibly bad choice” to CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday, adding that the Ohio Republican senator “seems to be more erratic and more extreme than President Trump”. “I’ll bet President Trump is sitting there scratching his head and wondering, why did I pick this guy? The choice may be one of the best things he ever did for Democrats,” Schumer said.

The developments come as a new ABC News/Ipsos poll on Sunday found that Harris’s favorability rating had jumped to 43% from 35% a week earlier. It found a major jump in her favorability rating among electorally crucial independent voters, with 44% saying they viewed her favorably compared with 28% the previous week.","A woman stands at a podium with the United States Presidential Seal, speaking into a microphone.

4432d9d830,Financial Times,Labour’s pledge to cut work visas worries business - Financial Times,"Sir Keir Starmer’s pledge to cut work-related immigration to the UK is achievable, but linking visa rules to training may not solve long-standing skills and labour shortages, according to policy experts.

“Read my lips, I will bring immigration down,” the Labour leader told The Sun on Sunday newspaper. Migration is one of three topics frequently cited by voters as the main policy issues affecting the UK, according to polling.

Starmer said he wanted to ban “bad bosses” who underpaid workers or broke other employment rules from hiring overseas into the UK.

He also pledged to link immigration with skills policy, so that high demand for visas in particular sectors would automatically trigger a push to train more British workers.

By Labour’s own admission, Starmer’s pledge to cut net migration from a near-record inflow of 685,000 in 2023 should be easy to deliver.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s Conservative government has already introduced measures, which Labour has supported, that appear to be reducing immigration to the UK.

These include a ban on masters students and care workers bringing relatives to the UK and a sharp increase in the salaries employers must pay to sponsor visas for skilled workers.

Recent Home Office data suggests applications to study in the UK and to work in care homes have already fallen sharply as a result of the changes.

Yvette Cooper, Labour’s shadow home secretary, on Sunday refused to set a target for the level of net migration a Labour government would see as appropriate, or a timescale by which the party would meet its pledge.

But she conceded in a BBC interview that Sunak’s measures meant Labour would “expect to see the numbers coming down swiftly”.

Cooper suggested Labour would go further, moving away from what she called a “free market approach to migration” to link employer use of visas with broader efforts to train British workers.

She cited five sectors — health, social care, IT, construction and engineering — where visa numbers had soared in recent years while the number of UK citizens starting apprenticeships had plunged.

The plans Labour has published so far do not appear to impose new obligations on employers to train UK workers before using the visa system but involve wider attempts by government to boost training.

However, business groups are nervous of the suggestion that “bad bosses” are responsible for rising immigration, and the prospect of new curbs making it harder for them to hire.

Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment & Employment Confederation, said a crude goal of cutting work-related immigration could be “really damaging to the economy” and drive away foreign investment.

Most employers did not routinely hire from abroad, because of the high costs, but immigration was a “palliative” to deep-seated skills and labour shortages, he said.

Carberry urged politicians to “fix the skills system before you take away the coping mechanism”.

The CBI, the employers’ organisation, said it supported a “stronger link between [labour] shortages and the training that is available”.

“It’s a key part of a more honest conversation about immigration,” said Matthew Percival, who is responsible for policy on skills and workforce issues at the CBI.

Others noted that Starmer’s attempt to pin high immigration on “bad bosses” ignored the fact that recent increases had been overwhelmingly driven by publicly funded or subsidised sectors facing tight budget constraints — higher education, social care and the NHS.

Jonathan Portes, professor at King’s College London, said the sector-focused approach outlined by Cooper would have no impact unless Labour put money behind the current government’s largely unfunded NHS recruitment drive and boosted funding for social care.

When it came to the private sector, improving the UK’s skills base was the right goal, but trying to solve a deep-seated structural problem through a link to visa rules was “a triumph of hope over experience”, he said.

“Actually, you just need to get skills policy right — and migration will solve itself,” said Portes.",A man in a dark suit is speaking into a microphone with a red background featuring the word 'CHANGE' and holding a card with a picture of a person.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA41BBD60>,2024-06-02 15:37:32.118000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/392f1411-6cee-468e-802a-72a5652f9650,['Politics' 'Business and Finance' 'National'],[0.9 0.8 0.7],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/4432d9d830.png
cca1414119,The Globe and Mail,Investors count on earnings to calm US$900-billion U.S. tech rout - The Globe and Mail,"As earnings season goes into full swing, bullish investors hope solid corporate results will stem a tumble in technology shares that has cooled this year’s U.S. stock rally.

The S&P 500′s technology sector has dropped nearly 6% in just over a week, shedding about US$900 billion in market value as growing expectations of interest rate cuts and a second Donald Trump presidency draw money away from this year’s winners and into sectors that have languished in 2024.

The S&P 500 has fared somewhat better, losing 1.6% in just over a week, with declines in tech partly offset by sharp gains in areas such as financials, industrials and small caps. The benchmark index is up more than 16% so far this year.

Second-quarter earnings could help tech reclaim the spotlight. Tesla and Google-parent Alphabet both report on Tuesday, kicking off results from the “Magnificent Seven” megacap group of stocks that have propelled markets since early 2023. Microsoft and Apple are set to report the following week.

Big tech stocks “have been leading the charge, and it’s for a good reason,” said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “They’re making money, they’re growing earnings, they’re owning their niche.”

Strong results from the market’s leaders could assuage some of the worries that have recently dogged megacaps, including concerns over stretched valuations and an advance highlighted by eye-watering gains in stocks such as Nvidia, which is up 145% this year despite a recent dip.

On the other hand, signs that profits are flagging or artificial intelligence-related spending is less than anticipated would test the narrative of tech dominance that has boosted stocks this year. That could turn quickly into a problem for broader markets: Alphabet, Tesla, Amazon.com, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Apple and Nvidia have accounted for around 60% of the S&P 500′s gain this year.

Corporate results for the market’s leaders are expected to meet a high bar. The tech sector is projected to increase year-over-year earnings by 17%, and earnings for the communication services sector -- which includes Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta -- is seen rising about 22%. Such gains would outpace the 11% estimated rise for the S&P 500 overall, according to LSEG IBES.

Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial, believes many investors were caught off guard by an inflation report earlier this month that all-but-cemented expectations of a September rate cut by the Fed, sparking a rotation into areas of the market that have struggled under tighter monetary policy.

The move out of tech accelerated this week, after a failed assassination attempt on Trump over the weekend appeared to boost his standing in the presidential race.

In addition, semiconductor shares were hit hard after a report earlier this week said the United States was mulling tighter curbs on exports of advanced semiconductor technology to China. The Philadelphia SE semiconductor index has tumbled about 8% since last week.

“What we’re advising investors to do is use some of the pullbacks in these areas as an opportunity to allocate on a longer-term basis,” said Saglimbene, who believes the upcoming earnings reports could ease the selling pressure on Big Tech.

To be sure, the widening of gains to other parts of the market has heartened some investors over the durability over the rally in stocks this year.

During the recent rotation, the number of stocks gaining compared to those declining over five days reached its highest rate since November, according to Ned Davis Research.

Historically, when gainers outnumber decliners by at least 2.5 times, as has been the case in this recent five-day period, the S&P 500 has rallied an average of 4.5% over the next three months, according to NDR.

“The risk is that mega-caps pull the popular averages lower, but history suggests that strong breadth improvements have been bullish for stocks moving forward,” Ned Davis strategists said in a report on Wednesday.",An individual is seen using a tablet in a data center with multiple computer screens displaying complex information in the background.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6B7D99ECB0>,2024-07-20 21:44:26+00:00,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/article-investors-count-on-earnings-to-calm-us900-billion-us-tech-rout/,['Business and Finance' 'National'],[0.95 0.75],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/cca1414119.png

Harris says 'unified reich' in Trump video was 'appalling'

In a speech to union workers today in Philadelphia, the vice-president, Kamala Harris, said the use of the term “unified reich” in a video posted by Donald Trump was “appalling”.

“In this moment, extremists are trying to divide our nation, and we see them as they encourage xenophobia and hate,” Harris said.

“This kind of rhetoric is unsurprising coming from the former president and it is appalling. And we’ve got to tell him who we are. And once again it shows that our freedom and our very democracy are at stake.”

Joe Biden was also asked about the remark as he campaigned in New Hampshire.

“It would take too long,” he quipped as he exited a Veterans of Foreign Wars post to shouts of “criminal” and “traitor” from Trump supporters stationed outside.

Closing summary

The White House slammed Donald Trump after he shared a now-deleted video on his Truth Social account that included the phrase “unified reich”. While the language may have been cribbed directly from Wikipedia, the vice-president, Kamala Harris, said it was “appalling”, but added: “This kind of rhetoric is unsurprising coming from the former president.” Meanwhile, in Arizona, Trump’s allies were arraigned on charges related to allegedly plotting to overturn Joe Biden’s election victory in 2020. Among the group was Rudy Giuliani, who tried mightily to avoid service of the indictment, but was ultimately tracked down thanks to his livestreaming.

Here’s what else happened today:

Trump told a local broadcaster he was “looking at” restrictions on contraception, then said he would never do such a thing in an all-caps post on Truth Social.

Antony Blinken’s appearance before a Senate committee was interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters.

“Unified reich” is not the first Nazi-adjacent terminology that Trump has used.

A bipartisan group of US senators condemned the international criminal court after the chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, requested arrest warrants against two of Israel’s leaders.

Peter Navarro, an incarcerated former Trump adviser, predicted mass deportations and the firing of the Federal Reserve chair if the ex-president returned to the White House.

A major part of Joe Biden’s strategy to win re-election is steering voters’ attention to the threat Donald Trump poses to reproductive rights beyond just abortion.

As president, Trump appointed three of the supreme court justices who overturned Roe v Wade and set the stage for states to ban access to the procedure. In a recent interview with a local broadcaster in Pittsburgh, Trump said he was “looking at” restrictions on contraception:

“Donald Trump and his allies have been waging an all-out assault on reproductive freedom – and contraceptives and Plan B are next on the chopping block,” Aida Ross, a spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee, said in response.

This afternoon, Trump issued an all-caps denial of any plans to go after contraceptives in a post on Truth Social:

I HAVE NEVER, AND WILL NEVER ADVOCATE IMPOSING RESTRICTIONS ON BIRTH CONTROL, or other contraceptives. This is a Democrat fabricated lie, MISINFORMATION/DISINFORMATION, because they have nothing else to run on except FAILURE, POVERTY, AND DEATH. I DO NOT SUPPORT A BAN ON BIRTH CONTROL, AND NEITHER WILL THE REPUBLICAN PARTY!

Pro-Palestinian protesters again interrupted secretary of state Antony Blinken as he appeared before a second Senate panel on Tuesday, calling him a “war criminal”.

Another shouted that he was abetting a “holocaust” in Gaza. “

“Secretary Blinken, how dare you,” one of the activists yelled before being removed by police. Several more antiwar activists sat silently behind him with their painted red hands raised, a symbol of the bloodshed in Gaza.

Blinken did not respond to the protests and paused while the activists were removed from the room before continuing with his remarks.

“We have to do better by the people of Gaza,” Blinken testified.

Since the beginning of the war seven months ago, protests have been a feature of the pro-Palestinian movement calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and pushing the Biden administration to change its policy toward Israel. Blinken, over the course of several trips to the region, has become the face of Joe Biden’s response to the war – and a target of protests. Nearly all of his public appearances attract anti-war activists, and some even camped outside of his home in northern Virginia.

On Tuesday, the protesters who attended the hearings did not make clear policy demands. Instead, they focused their attacks on Blinken personally.

One told the secretary he would be remembered as the “butcher of Gaza”.

Reuters has released a new poll of Joe Biden’s popularity, which shows little has changed when it comes to Americans’ downbeat view of the president.

The poll conducted with Ipsos finds only 36% of respondents approve of Biden’s job performance, two percentage points lower than last month and a return to an all-time low lever last reached in April 2022. However, the drop was within the survey’s three-point margin of error.

Four protesters were removed before the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, finished his opening remarks in his first of four appearances on Capitol Hill this week.

One waved a Palestinian flag and said Blinken would be remembered as the “butcher of Gaza”. One attempted to approach the dais but was quickly blocked, and another was carried out. Several others remained silent, their hands painted red to symbolize the Palestinians killed by Israel’s bombardment of Gaza.

Blinken was pressed by both Democrats and Republicans about the administration’s Israel policy. Lawmakers also wanted to know about the situation in Haiti, the war in Ukraine, the death of the Iranian president in a helicopter crash, Chinese aggression and artificial intelligence.

For the most part, Blinken did not veer from his previous remarks on Israel. He called the decisions by an ICC prosecutor to seek warrants against Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders “profoundly wrongheaded” and said it would likely complicate US-backed peace talks. He also emphasized the US support for a two-state solution.

Two Democratic senators, Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, pressed Blinken to take a tougher line with Israel, while Republicans admonished Biden for withholding a shipment of bombs.

In a testy exchange with Ted Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas, Blinken categorically denied that the US was withholding intelligence from Israel on the whereabouts of top Hamas officials, or the locations of underground tunnels.

“I wish we had it,” he said.

Blinken will appear shortly before a Senate appropriations subcommittee.

It’s a very “split screen” day at the top of US politics.

Joe Biden was in Nashua, New Hampshire, moments ago on a classic but unremarkable election year visit.

He went to spell out the impact of the Pact Actthat helps military veterans who were exposed to toxins with getting key benefits, especially as a result of burn pits during their service.

The Biden administration said more than 1m claims have been granted to veterans since Biden signed the legislation into law in August 2022, across the country, with about $5.7bn in total benefits distributed to veterans and their survivors.

Meanwhile, Donald Trump was in criminal court in New York, where his defense wrapped up.

And his former lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and other minions were pleading not guilty in an election interference case in Arizona dating back to the 2020 election, when Biden won the state.

Here’s the line-up of those accused in the Arizona election interference case.

The Associated Press reports that in addition to Rudy Giuliani appearing remotely, those being arraigned on Tuesday are the former Arizona Republican party head Kelli Ward; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA; the state senator Anthony Kern; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican party; Robert Montgomery, a former chairman of the Cochise county Republican committee; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila county; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice-president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, past president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Kelli Ward; the attorneys Jenna Ellis and Christina Bobb; and Michael Roman, who was Trump’s 2020 director of election day operations.

Further arraignments are scheduled for 6 June for the state senator Jake Hoffman; on 7 June for the former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows; and on 18 June for Trump’s attorney Boris Epshteyn and for James Lamon, another Republican who claimed Trump carried the state.

The following are also defendants in the Georgia election interference case: Giuliani, Eastman, Ellis, Bobb and Roman. Trump is a central defendant in that criminal case. There is no date for that trial yet.

In this Arizona election interference case, former president and current presumed Republican nominee for the 2024 election, Donald Trump, was not charged but was referred to by prosecutors as an unindicted co-conspirator.

Arizona is the fourth state where allies of Trump have been charged with using false or unproven claims about voter fraud related to the election, the Associated Press reports.

The 11 people who claimed to be Arizona’s Republican electors met in Phoenix on 14 December 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were “duly elected and qualified” electors and asserting that Trump carried the state.

A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.

Of eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden’s victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 fake Arizona electors, who had asked a federal judge to decertify the results (ie, the Guardian adds, Biden’s surprise victory in Arizona in November 2020) and block the state from sending its results to the electoral college.

In dismissing the case, the judge concluded the Republicans had “failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims”. Days after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 participated in the certificate signing.

Note from Guardian archives: as part of the US electoral college system, states cast a set number of votes for the candidate who wins the popular vote in their state, the winner of which then takes the presidency.

During his remote appearance in an Arizona court today, Rudy Giuliani said he received a summons but did not have a copy of the indictment. He said he was familiar with the charges, though, by reading about them.

Arizona authorities tried unsuccessfully over several weeks to serve Giuliani notice of the indictment against him, the Associated Press reports.

Today in response to the prosecutors request for a $10,000 cash bond after outlining the difficulty in serving Giuliani in the case, Giuliani said:

I have a fair number of threats including death threats, and I don’t have security any more … so I have very strict rules about who gets up and who doesn’t.”

The judge required Giuliani to post a secured appearance bond of $10,000 as well as appear in Arizona within the next 30 days for booking procedures.

Arizona authorities unveiled the felony charges last month against Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring Trump, a Republican, had won Arizona.

The defendants include five lawyers connected to the former president and two former Trump aides.

The indictment alleges Ward, a former state senator who led the GOP in Arizona from 2019 until early 2023, organized the fake electors and urged then-vice-president Mike Pence to declare them to be the state’s true electors. It says Ward failed to withdraw her vote as a fake elector even though no legal challenges changed the outcome of the presidential race in Arizona.

Last week, attorney John Eastman, who devised a strategy to try to persuade Congress not to certify the election, was the first defendant in the case to be arraigned, pleading not guilty to the charges.

Giuliani pleads not guilty in election meddling case

Joanna Walters

Rudy Giuliani has pleaded not guilty to nine felony charges stemming from his role in efforts to overturn Donald Trump’s 2020 election loss in the key state of Arizona to Democrat Joe Biden. His trial has been scheduled for October – right before the presidential election.

The ex-New York City mayor, former presidential candidate and former lawyer for former president Trump, Giuliani, who turns 80 later this month, appeared remotely for an arraignment that was held in a Phoenix courtroom, the Associated Press reports.

Former Arizona Republican party chair Kelli Ward and at least 11 other people were also arraigned on Tuesday, accused of conspiracy, forgery and fraud charges. She and nine others have so far pleaded not guilty.

Giuliani said he did not have an attorney at this time but will. He was asked by the court whether he needed counsel appointed for the arraignment.

He said:

No, no, I think I am capable of handling it myself.”

The day so far

The Biden campaign is slamming Donald Trump after he shared a now-deleted video on his Truth Social account that included the phrase “unified reich”. While the language may have been cribbed directly from Wikipedia, the president’s re-election effort denounced it as Nazi rhetoric, and a White House spokesman chimed in to call such language “abhorrent, sickening and disgraceful”. Meanwhile, in Arizona, the former president’s allies are being arraigned on charges related to allegedly plotting to overturn Joe Biden’s election victory in 2020. Among the group is Rudy Giuliani, who tried mightily to avoid service of the indictment, but was ultimately tracked down thanks to his livestreaming.

Giuliani, Trump allies, face Arizona arraignment in 2020 election meddling case – report

Rudy Giuliani and other Donald Trump allies accused of attempting to meddle in Arizona’s 2020 election results are being arraigned today, the New York Times reports.

The defendants are facing charges of fraud, conspiracy and forgery for allegedly attempting to create fake presidential electors in order to disrupt Joe Biden’s election victory in the state. In addition to Giuliani, who is expected to be arraigned virtually, former Arizona Republican party head Kelli Ward and Christina Bobb, a former Trump campaign adviser who is now with the Republican national committee, are also facing charges.

In a jailhouse interview with Semafor, Peter Navarro, a former top trade adviser to Donald Trump, predicted mass deportations of undocumented migrants and the firing of Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell if the ex-president wins the November election.

“Trump will … quickly seal the border and begin mass deportations. Biden has imported a wave of crime and terrorism along with an uneducated mass that drives down wages of Black, brown, and blue-collar Americans. Blacks and Hispanics, particularly males in the workforce, are flocking to Trump in droves,” Navarro said in the interview, which was conducted over the law library email system at the federal prison where he is incarcerated following his conviction for defying the January 6 committee. Semafor notes that Navarro apparently remains in Trump’s good graces, and has been visited behind bars by members of his inner circle, raising speculation he could be appointed to a post in a second Trump administration.

Powell, a Republican, has led the fight against inflation, which has bedeviled Joe Biden’s presidency and caused his approval ratings to drop. Though Trump first nominated Powell for the job leading the powerful central bank, and Biden renominated him, Navarro predicts he would be removed if Trump takes office again:

Powell was Mnuchin’s folly – Powell raised rates too fast under Trump and choked off growth. To keep his job, Powell then raised rates too slowly to contain inflation under Biden. My guess is that this punctilious non-economist will be gone in a hundred days one way or the other. Former Council of Economic Advisers Chair Kevin Hassett would be a logical replacement; former CEA Chair Tyler Goodspeed would be a bold choice.

As the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, entered a hearing room in the Senate Dirksen building – his first of four appearances on Capitol Hill this week – anti-war protesters rose and raised their hands, painted blood red.

“Secretary of genocide,” they called, as he took his seat. “War criminal.”

According to local health officials, more than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israel’s war in Gaza. Israel says it is seeking to eradicate Hamas, which launched a cross-border attack that killed roughly 1,200 people on 7 October and took as many as 250 hostages.

Blinken is here ostensibly to make the case for Congress to approve Joe Biden’s $64bn state department and international affairs budget request. But he’ll certainly face pointed questions from senators on both sides of the aisle who are unhappy with the president’s Israel policy.

The Senate foreign relations committee, Blinken’s first stop of the week, features Republicans who are furious over the Biden administration’s decision to pause a bomb shipment to Israel as a warning to the nation not to launch a full-scale invasion of Rafah, and Democrats are also upset that the administration hasn’t done more to protect Palestinian civilians.

The hearings come at an extremely delicate moment for the region: a day after the international criminal court’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, applied for arrest warrants for two top Israeli officials – the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and defense minister, Yoav Gallant – as well as the leaders of Hamas. Meanwhile, Iran is reeling from the death of the country’s president and foreign minister in a helicopter crash near its border with Azerbaijan.

U.S. Politics

Balloons drop on a bandaged Trump

For about half an hour last night, a sombre Donald Trump worked to soothe a divided nation. “I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning for half of America,” he said at the Republican National Convention, in his first public speech since the attempt on his life. He recounted the story of his shooting – “you’ll never hear it from me a second time, because it’s actually too painful to tell” – and kissed the helmet of Corey Comperatore, the volunteer fireman who died at the rally and whose uniform was displayed on stage.

For the next 60 minutes, though, Trump pretty much sounded like he usually does on the stump. He talked about other countries “plundering” America, attacked the media and made false claims about the last election, wandered off script with callbacks to “Crazy Nancy Pelosi” and “the China virus,” and said the U.S. was contending with the worst “illegal immigration invasion” the world has ever seen. “They’re coming from prisons, they’re coming from jails, they’re coming from mental institutions and insane asylums. Has anyone seen Silence of the Lambs?”

At 92 minutes, Trump’s presidential acceptance speech was by far the longest in televised U.S. history, so you can’t fault his stamina. And Republicans leave Milwaukee riding high.

Oceans

Losers, haters and sharks

Throughout their national convention this week, Republicans tried mightily to sand down the edges of Donald Trump’s demeanour – less “American carnage,” more soft-focus, grandchild-hugging unifier. But there’s one position on which Trump has been rock-solid for well over a decade:

The man absolutely despises sharks.

Stormy Daniels said that at a dinner in his hotel room back in 2007, Trump couldn’t tear his eyes away from the Discovery Channel’s “Shark Week,” muttering “I hope all the sharks die.” He told a Pennsylvania crowd in 2020 that people often call him for donations to save the sharks, but his response is the same: “No, thank you, I have other things I can contribute to.” And just last month, at a rally in Las Vegas, Trump declared he’d rather take his chances with electrocution than with a shark, especially because there’s been “a lot of shark attacks lately, you notice that? A lot of shark.”

This isn’t true. Shark attacks are still exceptionally rare: The Florida Museum, which keeps a close eye on these matters, puts the odds at one in 11.5 million. That said, we have big news about sharks this week. As The Globe and Mail’s Lindsay Jones points out, white shark sightings are on the rise in Atlantic Canada, thanks to conservation efforts and a growing abundance of food. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans estimates as many as 257 tagged white sharks head through Cape Cod into Canada.

Of course, climate change is also a culprit: Warming ocean temperatures mean more white sharks can hang out in the once-chilly Canadian waters for longer periods of time. That’s why, Jones writes, it pays to be shark aware, avoiding swimming in the ocean at dawn and dusk, and staying away from areas where there’s a steep drop-off on the ocean floor.

Still, we – and Trump – can find some comfort in the wisdom of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (a federal agency that Project 2025 would like to dismantle). Sharks eat small fish, mollusks, crustaceans and the occasional seal, the NOAA says. But “people are not part of their natural diet.”

6412576bf0,Forbes,Trump 2.0 Can’t Stop Electric Vehicle Sales From Accelerating - Forbes,"Speaking at the Republican Convention, former President Trump made an impossible promise: “I will end the electric vehicle mandate on Day One.” Unfortunately, that rhetoric crashed into reality – there is no federal electric vehicle mandate.

No car company is being forced to sell electric vehicles and no consumer is being forced to buy them. The Biden administration’s policies have given consumers the freedom to choose cleaner air and cheaper energy costs by driving electric. And no matter what he says, Trump can’t repeal existing environmental standards on his first day in office.

Unfortunately, Trump is not the only one misleading the public about an EV mandate. Nationwide television ads funded by oil companies falsely claim the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s standards mandate EVs and impose a “ban” on gasoline vehicles. This is also misinformation, that could keep consumers chained to volatile oil prices and pain at the pump. No EPA standards have ever banned the sale of gasoline or diesel vehicles. A quick visit to an auto dealership would dispel this myth.

Trump and the oil industry’s ads likely refer to the EPA’s most recent clean car standards, released in March 2024. The standards establish tailpipe emission reduction targets through 2032 – the goal is to cut tailpipe pollution so that all Americans can breathe cleaner air. The standards may indeed encourage EV sales, but these are still not mandates.

For decades, EPA regulations have been designed so carmakers can develop a mix of cars and trucks in their fleet that meets clean air and emission goals, including cleaner gasoline and diesel, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, fuel cell vehicles and EVs. Allowing automakers to choose what technology they invest in fosters innovation and investment – for proof look at the “Battery Belt” of factories springing up across the Southeast U.S. and the billions in EV manufacturing investments automakers are pouring into our communities. Encouraging clean cars also cuts air pollution from America’s transportation sector, the country’s largest source of the carbon emissions heating up our planet and a significant contributor to toxic smog and soot.

Rolling back these clean car standards would have significant consequences for our economy and the air we all breathe. It would increase emissions, slow job and economic growth, undermine efforts to meet international climate commitments, and jeopardize public health and environmental sustainability. Fortunately, any attempt Trump might make to repeal the EPA clean car program will face multiple hurdles.

First, rolling back clean car standards will face significant legal challenges from environmental organizations, states including California – the nation’s largest car market, and even auto manufacturers. These legal battles would likely extend over months or years, making a Day One repeal impractical.

No matter what Trump says, the EPA also must adhere to the Clean Air Act. As the senior director of transportation emissions at EPA, I led the first set of EPA regulations to address greenhouse gas emissions in automobiles, so I know well how rigorous the process for developing federal environmental regulations is. It involves extensive research, stakeholder engagement, and public comments over the course of several years. During a public comment period, stakeholders can submit comments in writing and attend hearings held across the country to testify in person. The EPA must account for all this public input in its final rule.

The EPA's updated clean car program was crafted following this same meticulous process, including thousands of pages of legal, engineering, and cost-benefit analyses. The overall benefits of these new rules are estimated at $2.1 trillion, with consumers saving $1 trillion by using less oil and gas, which translates into savings at the pump.

The bottom line is that reversing such regulatory standards is not as simple as signing an executive order. Any major change to regulation requires a similar, time-consuming process of proposal, public comment, and finalization, all subject to legal scrutiny, typically also lasting several years.

These long-standing processes are what helped stymie Trump from rolling back clean energy and transportation to regulatory programs that EPA has finalized. In his first term, Trump’s proposed cuts to the previous EPA clean car program were so radical that even automakers—the group Trump claimed to be helping—said they went too far. In fact, five major auto companies agreed to meet California's more ambitious clean car standards over the ones proposed by the Trump-controlled EPA.

The economic landscape has changed, and even if Trump were re-elected and did attempt to roll back the EPA’s clean car programs, forward thinking car manufacturers will once again join California to oppose him. Stellantis recently signed a historic deal with California that aligns with the state’s zero emission goals, regardless of the election or court decisions. I encourage GM, Ford and other forward thinking car manufacturers to follow Stellantis’ example and sign similar agreements with California.

Trump may imagine that in his second term EPA’s authority would be curtailed by the Supreme Court’s recent Chevron deference decision, but that ruling is unlikely to impact the EPA's April 2024 clean car program. The Supreme Court's ruling on the Chevron doctrine recognizes the importance of Congressional delegations of discretion to agencies like EPA and in status expressly cited the Clean Air Act. For example, the clean car program under the Clean Air Act is precisely such a delegation of discretion to EPA. That means EPA’s new standards based on such a meticulous consideration of the law and technical issues is precisely the exercise of a congressional delegation of discretion to an agency that should be upheld under the Supreme Court’s recent ruling.

Beyond the legal limitations Trump would face in any attempt to roll back environmental legislation, many elements of EV adoption simply aren’t controlled by the federal government. California has implemented stringent emissions standards and EV adoption rules, and 17 other states are committed to adopting its clean car programs. These states, which represent about 40% of new car sales in U.S., are likely to continue their efforts to clean up emissions regardless of any federal reversals. And consumers are increasingly choosing EVs over gas-powered cars – U.S. EV sales have passed 10% of total auto sales and are forecast to comprise 20% of all cars on American roads by 2030.

Perhaps even more importantly, eliminating existing clean car programs now creates political risks in red, blue, and purple states alike. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act has spurred over $360 billion in investments in clean technology manufacturing and infrastructure, creating nearly 313,000 jobs as of June 2024, many in the EV sector and many in red states. Erasing these well-paying domestic manufacturing jobs just because they are also environmentally beneficial would be a huge political risk.

Undoing the momentum created by this massive federal investment in our country would also be economically disruptive. Reversing existing EV policies will create massive uncertainty for car manufacturers and suppliers about future investment. At the same time, global competitors like China and the European Union are financially supporting and rapidly growing their EV markets. Reducing support for EVs could weaken America’s competitive position in this critical and growing industry.

President Trump’s promise to repeal Biden’s EV policies fails to acknowledge the complexities and challenges inherent in such an action. Undoing established regulations is neither swift nor simple, involving legal hurdles, state-level initiatives, and broader market trends towards electrification.

The future of transportation is undeniably electric. The shift towards EVs is being driven by environmental necessity, technological innovation, and economic opportunity. Instead of attempting reverse this progress, the next president should build on the foundations laid by current policies, ensuring a sustainable and prosperous future for all.","A man in a dark suit and red tie gestures with his right hand, possibly making a point or emphasizing something, with a microphone stand in front of him against a dark background.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BA53CB2B0>,2024-08-13 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.forbes.com,https://www.forbes.com/sites/margooge/2024/08/13/trump-20-cant-stop-electric-vehicle-sales-from-accelerating/,['Politics' 'Business and Finance'],[0.95 0.75],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/6412576bf0.png
e879ae465e,CNN,John Deere backs away from diversity and inclusion efforts after a conservative backlash - CNN,"John Deere says it will no longer sponsor “social or cultural awareness” events, becoming the latest major US company to distance itself from diversity and inclusion measures after being targeted by conservative backlash.

In a statement posted Tuesday to social media platform X, the farm equipment maker also said it would audit all training materials “to ensure the absence of socially-motivated messages” in compliance with federal and local laws. It did not specify what those messages would include.

The Moline, Illinois-based John Deere added “the existence of diversity quotas and pronoun identification have never been and are not company policy.” But it noted that it would still continue to “track and advance” the diversity of the company, without providing further details.

The move from the company known on Wall Street as Deere & Co. arrives just weeks after rural retailer Tractor Supply ended an array of its corporate diversity and climate efforts. Both announcements came after backlash piled up online from conservative activists opposed to diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, sponsorship of LGBTQ+ Pride events and climate advocacy.

Conservative political commentator and filmmaker Robby Starbuck appeared to lead the criticism of both companies on X.

Starbuck posted that John Deere’s announcement marked “another huge win in our war on wokeness,” but said that it still wasn’t enough, calling on the company to completely eliminate its DEI policies and no longer participate in Corporate Equality Index scoring from the Human Rights Campaign, the largest advocacy group for LGBTQ+ rights in the US.

Starbuck, a 35-year-old Cuban American, told The Associated Press that “it’s not lost on me my kids would benefit from this stuff,” but he opposes hiring decisions that factor in race, as well as DEI initiatives, employee resource groups that promote non-professional activities and any policies that in his view allow social issues and politics to become part of a company culture.

“People should go to work without having to feel like they have to behave a certain way in order to be acceptable to their employer,” he said.

Starbuck and other conservative activists celebrated Brentwood, Tennessee-based Tractor Supply for taking a more aggressive approach than John Deere last month by pledging to eliminate all of its DEI roles while retiring current DEI goals and stop submitting data to the Human Rights Campaign.

But the move also sparked outrage from critics of the new position, who have argued that Tractor Supply is giving in to hate.

John Deere’s move has faced similar pushback. Eric Bloem, vice president of programs and corporate advocacy at the Human Rights Campaign, called the announcement “disappointing” and “a direct result of a coordinated attack by far-right extremists on American business.”

National Black Farmers Association President John Boyd, Jr., called for the resignation of Deere & Co CEO John C. May and a boycott of the company on Wednesday.

The organization said that Deere “continues to move in the wrong direction” in regards to DEI and has “failed to show its support” for Black farmers since NBFA’s founding. It also noted Tuesday’s announcement arrives one month after the company agreed to pay $1.1 million in back wages and interest to 277 Black and Hispanic job applicants after the Labor Department alleged hiring discrimination.

The conservative backlash against DEI has extended to companies across industries, including previous boycott campaigns against Bud Light and Target over their LGBTQ+ marketing. Starbuck said he has a list of companies he is thinking of posting content about, starting with ones that have traditionally conservative customer bases. He declined to name his next target.

The ensuing changes to policy and corporate commitments aren’t just coming from company boardrooms. Leading HR organization Society for Human Resource Management last week announced that the 340,000-member lobbying and advocacy group will drop “equity” from its diversity and inclusion approach, although it said it remains committed to advancing it.

“Effective immediately, SHRM will be adopting the acronym ‘I&D’ instead of ‘IE&D,” the group said in a statement posted on LinkedIn. “By emphasizing Inclusion-first, we aim to address the current shortcomings of DE&I programs, which have led to societal backlash and increasing polarization.”

The move, in turn, triggered a backlash among LinkedIn users, some calling it “backward” and “shameful.” Others replied that they were planning to cancel their SHRM memberships.

Still others stress that prioritizing equity is critical for leveling the playing field, saying this kind of omission signals a shift in messaging that could have chilling consequences on efforts toward workplace equality.

In an interview with The AP on Wednesday, SHRM’s president and CEO Johnny C. Taylor, Jr. said the organization’s focus groups found general consensus around prioritizing diversity and inclusion, but “the E triggered like all sorts of emotions and responses.”

“You either loved it, you hated it,” he said. “If it’s so polarizing that people just abandon it, then we all lost.”

Legal attacks against companies’ diversity, equity and inclusion efforts have also drawn more attention following the Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling to end affirmative action in college admissions. Many conservative and anti-DEI activists have been seeking to set a similar precedent in the working world.

“The blowback and the potential vulnerabilities are real,” said Jen Stark, co-director of the Center for Business and Social Justice at BSR, a consulting network of more than 300 companies.

A vast majority of companies are “not taking the bait” and keeping policies in place “because it makes good business sense and it’s also the right thing to do,” she said. Still, she added, external pressures are building up.

The U.S. is also in a fraught presidential election year, with bubbling conversations about the prospect of Project 2025 — a term for the Heritage Foundation’s nearly 1,000-page handbook for the next Republican administration, which has become a cudgel Democrats are wielding against former President Donald Trump.

Stark noted that companies across industries are bracing for the prospects of potential changes in terms of their federal contracts, for example, which have historically been a powerful way to promote equity in workplaces.

That doesn’t mean companies will stop their DEI efforts entirely, she added, but they may have to change language or find new workarounds.

“All these flash points that companies are, sort of, limping between is the new normal,” she said.","A John Deere tractor is seen in a field with a plow attached, indicating agricultural activity.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BCBFA1630>,2024-07-18 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/18/business/john-deere-diversity-inclusion-efforts/index.html,['Politics' 'Business and Finance'],[0.85 0.8 ],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/e879ae465e.png
d7d40ffc42,The Guardian,Who is Robert Fico? - The Guardian,"Who is Fico?

Born into a working-class family on 15 September 1964, Fico – a lawyer by profession – began his political career with the Communist party shortly before the 1989 Velvet Revolution that led to the breakup of former Czechoslovakia.

He was Slovakia’s representative to the European court of human rights from 1994 to 2000 and set up his centre-left Smer-SD party in 1999 after being turned down for a ministerial post by the Democratic Left, the Communists’ political heirs.

Smer won a landslide victory in 2006, catapulting Fico into the prime minister’s seat two years after Slovakia joined the EU. In 2009, he led his country into the eurozone, but was unable to form a coalition the following year despite winning elections.

He scored another landslide in 2012 after the fall of a centre-right coalition over corruption allegations, and won again in 2016 – but had to resign two years later amid mass protests over the murder of an investigative journalist and his fiancee. In October, he returned for a third-term as a PM at the head of a populist-nationalist coalition.

Embroiled in allegations of corruption he has always denied, Fico is brash and outspoken, with a penchant for bodybuilding, football and fast cars.

What are his politics?

Fico admires both Vladimir Putin, saying he would not permit the Russian president’s arrest under an international warrant if he came to Slovakia, and Hungary’s illiberal leader, Viktor Orbán, “who defends the interests of his country and his people”.

The Smer leader is also a tactician: in a three-decade career, he has navigated successfully between mainstream, pro-EU positions and a fiercely nationalist, anti-western rhetoric destined mainly for domestic consumption, proving more than willing to change tack depending on public opinion or political reality.

Saying he only has Slovakian interests at heart, Fico has been outspoken on numerous issues, savaging the EU and international NGOs, insulting his rivals, falsely alleging a coup plot and claiming the vote would be rigged.

He is also fiercely opposed to immigration – a key factor in his 2016 election win – and rejects “a distinct Muslim community in Slovakia”. More recently, he has criticised same-sex marriage and described adoption by same-sex couples as a “perversion”.

During the Covid pandemic he became the country’s most prominent voice against masks, lockdowns and vaccination. Before taking up office again in October, he exploited high levels of pro-Russian sentiment in Slovakia to undermine the government’s pro-western course.

What has happened in his third term as prime minister?

Critics worry that Fico is abandoning Slovakia’s pro-western course and following the direction of Hungary under Orbán. Thousands of people have rallied in the capital and across Slovakia to protest against Fico’s policies.

In February, MPs approved legal changes that scrapped a special prosecutor’s office dealing with high-level corruption, lowered penalties for financial crimes, and cut the statute of limitations for rape.

In April, the government approved a proposal to abolish the public broadcaster and replace it with a new body. The plan has drawn fierce criticism from opposition parties, who say it will give the government full control of public radio and television.

Also in April, Peter Pellegrini, a Ukraine-sceptic and close ally of Fico, won a run-off vote in presidential elections against the liberal, pro-western opposition candidate, Ivan Korčok.

Pellegrini is due to succeed Zuzana Čaputová, the country’s first female head of state. Čaputová, a staunch backer of neighbouring Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s invasion, announced she would not run for re-election last June after receiving death threats.","A man in a suit stands at a podium with a microphone, gesturing with his right hand, with two flags behind him, one red and one blue, and the logo of The Guardian in the bottom right corner.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BA22EEA70>,2024-05-15 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/15/who-is-robert-fico,['Politics' 'International'],[0.9 0.7],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/d7d40ffc42.png
cf66e36dc9,Forbes,How Don Fulano Tequila Maintains Authenticity Through Generations Of Agave Farming - Forbes,"Don Fulano’s journey began long before its first bottle was distilled in December 2002. Founded by Enrique Fonseca and Sergio Mendoza, Don Fulano Tequila traces its roots back 140 years to the highlands of Jalisco, Mexico, where their great-grandfathers began cultivating agave.

Today, Don Fulano is one of the last family-owned tequila brands that is fully self-sufficient in its agave supply.

“Everything about Don Fulano is rooted in its history,” Sergio Mendoza, co-founder of Don Fulano Tequila, tells Forbes. “Tequila as a category has had its great moments pretty much in the same time frame: first came the revolution, which was an agrarian and political movement; then came the cultural revolution with all the muralists, novelists, poets and filmmakers that searched to find the real identity of the new Mexico that was emerging from the clash of two completely different civilizations.”

This deep connection to the land and the agave plant is central to Don Fulano’s philosophy. The brand’s commitment to quality begins with hand-selecting mature agave—from only Maduro and Pinto agave plants—each harvest, followed by a dual distillation process refined through generations. This approach not only ensures high-quality ingredients free of additives but also allows the tequila to capture the essence of the land from which it originates.

“The agave plant has always been central to Mexico and its history and of course agave spirits were part of it,” Mendoza says. “Today, we very much do the same: farm agave and produce a product that reflects our land as closely as possible. Of course, we face many challenges as every farmer does, but we try hard to keep as close and as simple a connection with the source.”

The brand’s commitment to authenticity is further emphasized by its membership in Tequila Matchmaker’s Additive-Free alliance.

“For us, tequila is all about the agave, and the yeast and water that necessarily come into play together with heat and time,” Mendoza explains about the significance of the additive-free process. “If we honestly talk about spirits, we can't really talk about synthetic additives that just make something taste like something else.

And one of Don Fulano's core distinguishing factors is its 100% self-sufficiency in agave supply. This autonomy allows the brand to maintain consistent quality and authenticity, even in challenging times.

“In an ideal world, tequila makers don't necessarily have to farm their own agave,” Mendoza says. “But in hard times, it certainly comes as a blessing to be able to farm your own raw material because quite simply everything else depends on it.”

The use of estate-grown mature agave, proprietary yeast and natural spring volcanic water is a hallmark of Don Fulano’s production process. These elements contribute to the unique flavor profile of their tequilas, each expression offering a distinct taste experience. From the robust Blanco to the complex Imperial, Don Fulano’s tequilas cater to a variety of palates and occasions.

Produced at the Tequileña distillery in Tequila, Don Fulano’s portfolio currently includes five expressions: Blanco, Fuerte, Reposado, Añejo and Imperial, ranging from $54.99 to $219.99 in suggested retail prices.

“All Don Fulano expressions are rooted in the same agave fields and with a very similar process,” Mendoza says. “They are just different cuts or segments of time that work amazingly in different situations, moods or timings.”

But even with a commitment to preserving tradition and heritage, the company still maintains some individuality. The name Don Fulano, roughly translating from Spanish to English as “a gentleman of unknown or undisclosed identity,” reflects a playful departure from the industry norm of naming tequilas after their makers.

Looking toward the next century

Maintaining a family-owned tequila business in today’s competitive market is not without its challenges.

“It has certainly required patience because today's world is so loud, and whoever makes the most noise is always heard first,” Mendoza acknowledges.

However, he remains optimistic about the future of Don Fulano, attributing the company’s success to the support of the industry and the appreciation of consumers who value authenticity and quality.

“For us, it has always been the industry that has supported us,” Mendoza says. “And through them, we have found our way to the consumer, who once exposed to authentic products always responds positively.”","Four bottles of Don Fulano Tequila are displayed against a dark background with a rustic texture, featuring labels with the brand name and product type.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x131 at 0x7D6BA2B27700>,2024-07-24 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.forbes.com,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelking/2024/07/24/how-don-fulano-tequila-maintains-authenticity-through-generations-of-agave-farming/,['Business and Finance' 'Entertainment'],[0.85 0.6 ],Unlikely,Likely,sample_review/images/cf66e36dc9.png
bb90902687,Global News Toronto,"Timeline of slayings of 4 women in Winnipeg, demands to search landfill for remains - Global News Toronto","A Winnipeg man has admitted to killing four women in Winnipeg but claims he’s not criminally responsible because of mental illness. A judge is scheduled to give a verdict Thursday in the first-degree murder trial of Jeremy Skibicki.

Here is a timeline of the case:

March 15, 2022 — Police say an unidentified woman is killed on or around this date.

May 1, 2022 — Morgan Harris, a member of Long Plain First Nation living in Winnipeg, is last seen in the area of Main Street and Henry Avenue north of the city’s downtown. Police say the 39-year-old is killed on or around this date.

May 16, 2022 — Officers find the partial remains of Contois in a garbage bin near an apartment building. They secure the Brady Road Resource Management Facility, a city-run landfill, where they believe there could be more remains. Police say they believe the remains of Harris and Myran were transported to the privately operated Prairie Green landfill, north of Winnipeg, on this day.

May 18, 2022 — Skibicki is arrested and charged with first-degree murder in the death of Contois. Officers execute a search warrant at his apartment in the same area where her remains were found.

May 19, 2022 — Police say remains found in the garbage bin near the building belong to Contois.

June 21, 2022 — Police say remains found at the Brady landfill are of Contois.

Dec. 1, 2022 — Police charge Skibicki with three counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Harris, Myran and the unidentified woman. They say the unknown woman is believed to be Indigenous and in her mid-20s. Indigenous leaders later name her Mashkode Bizhiki’ikwe or Buffalo Woman.

Dec. 2, 2022 — Skibicki appears in court. Police Chief Danny Smyth says the remains of Harris and Myran are believed to be at the Prairie Green landfill but no search is planned because too much time has passed.

Dec. 6, 2022 — Police defend their decision not to search Prairie Green. Relatives of Harris share their disappointment and anger on Parliament Hill and say they’re prepared to search on their own.

Dec. 8, 2022 — Operations at Prairie Green stop as the Manitoba government and the City of Winnipeg decide how to proceed. First Nations leaders call for the police chief to resign.

Dec. 14, 2022 — Smyth apologizes in a meeting with First Nations leaders and the victims’ families for comments about not searching the landfill. Police are to be part of an Indigenous-led committee that will study feasibility of a search.

May 12, 2023 — The study says a search is feasible but could take up to three years and cost $184 million. Family members and Indigenous leaders say it must go ahead.

July 5, 2023 — Manitoba’s Progressive Conservative government says searching the landfill is too risky.

6dc15b50e8,CBS Chicago,UChicago professor: Assassination attempt on Trump comes in climate of rising political violence in U.S. - CBS Chicago,"CHICAGO (CBS) -- Over the last few years, there has been an uptick in political violence in the U.S.—and while the motivations may vary, the motive for the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump on Saturday remained unknown a day later.

University of Chicago Professor of Political Science Robert Pape specializes in international security affairs—and has studied political violence for years. He now also serves as the director of the Chicago Project on Security & Threats, and since 2021, he has studied political violence in America following the Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6 of that year.

Pape's research and findings show how 270 million Americans feel about political violence—and how the country reached this point.

""And what we found, right from the beginning, is a significant amount of support for political violence in the mainstream. We found nearly 5 to 10% of American adults were supporting political violence to restore Donald Trump to the presidency. Over that three-year period of time, it has ebbed and flowed,"" said Pape. ""And we now find that 10% of American adults support the use of force to stop Donald Trump from becoming president.""

Darius Johnson's full interview with UChicago Professor Robert Pape:

Pape's latest study with the Chicago Project on Security & Threats, released in June, showed 6.9% of Americans—or 18 million adults—believe the use of force is justified to restore former President Trump to the White House, while 10% of Americans—or 26 million adults—believe political violence is justified to prevent Trump from becoming president again.

The study found that both of these groups that support political violence are active and dangerous, and have the potential for growth.

Of the 26 million who support political violence to keep Trump from being president again, 22 million have access to internet organizational tools, 9 million own guns, 6 million believe police officers who are violently attacked deserve it, 5 million attended a protest in the past 12 months, 3 million are militia members or know someone who is a militia member, and 2 million had prior military experience, the study found.

Of the 18 million who support violence to restore Trump to the White House, 16 million have access to the internet and organizational tools; 8 million own guns; 7 million believe those who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 were patriots; 4 million or militia members or know someone who is a militia member, and 2 million attended a protest in the past 12 months, and 1 million had had prior military experience, the study found.

The survey of 2,061 people was conducted between June 20 and June 24, and had a margin of error of +/-2.97%. The conclusions on the number of people who support political violence either for or against getting Trump back into the White House are based on the study's use of nationally-representative probability samples—the gold standard in polling.

The questions in the survey were designed to track the scope and drivers of support for political violence on both the left and right.

Meanwhile, Pape said violence has been part of several other highly-charged political events over the past several years—and the people behind the violence believed themselves to be justified.

""We saw 7 to 10% of the George Floyd protests were riots. Those folks thought they had legitimate reasons to riot,"" said Pape. ""We saw the January 6 riot against the Capitol. Those folks thought they had legitimate reasons to riot. We saw the Palestinian, pro-Palestinian, pro-Hamas protest, a fraction of which we're storming buildings and throwing bricks and so forth and so on. And those folks thought they had legitimate reasons to be acting violently.""

The last time a president—sitting or former—was shot was March 30, 1981, when President Ronald Reagan was shot while walking back to his limousine after speaking at the Washington Hilton in Washington, D.C. Six years earlier, would-be assassins tried to shoot President Gerald Ford on two different occasions, but he was not struck in either.

But Pape raised comparisons to 1968—the year Robert F. Kennedy was shot and killed while giving his victory speech for the California primary at a hotel in Los Angeles. Kennedy was assassinated in June of that year, two months after Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis.

The year 1968 was also infamous for political turmoil that sometimes involved violence—including unrest in Chicago after Dr. King's assassination, mobilization against the Vietnam War, and violent clashes between police and protesters at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

""There are some superficial similarities to what's happening today—to what happened in the 1960s; that we're fighting in the 1960s a foreign war, very controversial foreign war in Vietnam,"" Pape said. ""We also have a situation where we have a wounded president, Lyndon Johnson, in 1968. Joe Biden here now, he's not as wounded as President Johnson. But that you also have, in '68, the Democratic Party in a crisis. Well, here we have a Democratic Party in crisis. So these are all the similarities, but some of the root factors are very different.""

Anxiety about demographic change cited as cause for political violence

How did America get to this point in 2024? Pape cited demographic change.

""We are going to a transition where we're becoming; we're going from a white majority democracy to a white minority democracy. Right now, about 62% of Americans are white. If you had gone back 30 years, that would have been 82% would have been white,"" Pape said. ""So this this is not always been this way, and this demographic change has been happening for years, and actually for decades. But we're at the tipping point of change now some parts of the country don't want that change.""

Pape said anxiety about demographic change is behind the rise of right-wing populism in America.

""So you're getting a lot of political anger around this major demographic change, and this demographic change is going to go on for about another 10, 15 years,"" he said. ""So this is this is where Donald Trump came from in the first place, and this is why his movement is growing.""

Pape added that the current crisis is serious—and wishful thinking about how it will end isn't helpful.

""We really need to recognize we're going through a crisis in our American democracy, and this is a manifestation of this crisis, what we just saw yesterday, and these continuous hopes that everything is just going to fade away is just simply unrealistic, given the dynamics I just explained,"" he said.

The anxiety about demographic change that Pape said was spurring political violence is not going away.

""This is not ending just with this election. This. What we are seeing is does the demographic changes continue, and the consternation about that gets worse and worse,"" said Pape. ""Our politics is getting worse. The violence is getting worse, and this is the real crisis in our democracy.""

He said this is especially alarming for a country that has remained at the forefront.

""The United States was the world's first genuine democracy 248 years ago, and we're now becoming the world's first truly multiracial democracy,"" Pape said.

As political violence remains present, Pape urged unity among the American people—while issuing a challenge to political leaders.

""The crucial thing that should happen, and needs to happen, to hold our country together—especially in the next six to nine months—is for political leaders on both sides of the aisle to condemn violence if it's supported by their side,"" Pape said. ""It's been easy for Republicans to condemn violence that's coming from the left, or it's been easy for Democrats to condemn violence coming from the right—say, January 6. The hard thing is for political leaders to condemn violence coming from their own side. But this is absolutely critical.""

If lawmakers on both sides do not issue that broad condemnation of political violence, Pape said it's likely that the violence will just keep getting worse.

""With the assassination attempt against Donald Trump, we'll start to get retaliatory political violence against Democrats and Democratic leaders,"" he said. ""We can start to see spirals of political violence that can occur so and this is going to be something that, once those spirals start to occur, this is going to be extremely hard to control, and put those genies back into the bottle.""

Pape also got into social media and the spread of misinformation. He said social media continues to add fuel to the fire.","A group of police officers in tactical gear are on a stage, with one officer holding a rifle and another holding a baton, while a person in a blue uniform is kneeling on the ground.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BA545A2C0>,2024-07-14 23:47:00+00:00,https://www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/uchicago-professor-assassination-attempt-trump-rising-political-violence/,['Politics' 'National'],[0.9 0.8],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/6dc15b50e8.png

White House spokesperson declines comment on reports of Alito flying flag associated with Trump support

The White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, declined to comment on the New York Times’s report that Samuel Alito flew an upside down American flag at a time when it was being used by supporters of Donald Trump’s lies about the 2020 election.

“We’ve seen the reporting, and I don’t want to comment on the specific report,” Jean-Pierre replied when asked about the Times’s story at her ongoing press briefing.

However, she noted that Joe Biden believed people should respect the country’s flag:

What I can say more broadly, is that the president believes that the American flag is sacred. You’ve heard him say that, and is owed proper respect and honor for the brave men and women who have defended our country for generations.

Closing summary

Democrats are howling after the New York Times reported that a flag associated with Donald Trump’s false election fraud claims flew outside the house of Samuel Alito, a conservative supreme court justice. Dick Durbin, the Democratic chair of the Senate judiciary committee, called on Alito to recuse himself from cases involving Trump and the 2020 election – such as the ex-president’s petition for immunity from the federal charges related to his plot to keep Joe Biden from taking office. In a rare interview with Fox News, Alito said that the flag was raised by his wife after a confrontation with a neighbor.

Here’s a rundown of what else happened today:

Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, had no comment on the report of Alito’s pro-Trump flag flying, but noted that Biden feels the country’s banner is “sacred”.

Alito is among the conservative justices who appeared skeptical of the government’s arguments at a hearing over Trump’s immunity petition last month.

The banner flown from Alito’s house was an upside-down American flag, a traditional symbol of distress that became associated with support for Trump’s “stop the steal” movement.

The House oversight committee devolved into chaos last night as personal arguments broke out between Democratic and Republican lawmakers.

A big story that broke this week was the agreement – made public in a series of rapid-fire tweets – for Donald Trump and Joe Biden to meet for two debates, in June and September. The Guardian’s Lauren Gambino reports that the two candidates are hoping to use the events to gain an edge over the other:

It’s game on for a pair of presidential debates between two unpopular candidates most Americans wish weren’t running for the nation’s highest office.

In a ratatat social media exchange on Wednesday, Joe Biden and Donald Trump agreed to participate in two debates on 27 June, hosted by CNN, and on 10 September, hosted by ABC.

“Make my day, pal,” Biden said in a video, challenging his predecessor and rival to a high-stakes showdown. Trump, who had been insisting for months he would debate Biden “anytime, anyplace”, quickly accepted the offer: “Let’s get ready to Rumble!!!”

The arrangement jolted a general election campaign that had begun to feel stagnant. And if their plans hold, Americans will be treated to a presidential matchup far earlier than usual – before either candidate will have formally accepted his party’s nomination.

“The candidates realize the value of the debates, especially given their ages,” said Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan. “They need to show that they have the stamina to debate for 90 minutes or two hours to reassure the country.”

The decision to square off at least twice before the November election reflects a careful calculation by both candidates who believe televised confrontations will help magnify the other’s weaknesses.

The White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, also did not have much to say when asked if Joe Biden had any thoughts on the partisan fracas that took place last night in the House oversight committee.

“I have not talked to him about if [he’s] seen it,” Jean-Pierre said at her press conference.

“What we can say and I think this is something the president would agree upon … as someone who was a senator for 36 years he believes that people should respect each other, treat with each other with dignity and civility.”

White House spokesperson declines comment on reports of Alito flying flag associated with Trump support

The White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, declined to comment on the New York Times’s report that Samuel Alito flew an upside down American flag at a time when it was being used by supporters of Donald Trump’s lies about the 2020 election.

“We’ve seen the reporting, and I don’t want to comment on the specific report,” Jean-Pierre replied when asked about the Times’s story at her ongoing press briefing.

However, she noted that Joe Biden believed people should respect the country’s flag:

What I can say more broadly, is that the president believes that the American flag is sacred. You’ve heard him say that, and is owed proper respect and honor for the brave men and women who have defended our country for generations.

In a series of tweets, the progressive Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said the squabble that broke out last night at a meeting of the House oversight committee was used as an excuse by Republicans to force a vote on holding the attorney general, Merrick Garland, in contempt.

The GOP is pushing the contempt citation over Garland’s refusal to hand over recordings of Joe Biden’s interview with a justice department special counsel. Ocasio-Cortez accused Republicans of seizing on the chaos that broke out as insults flew between the far-right Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene and the Democrat Jasmine Crockett to block the opposition from offering amendments to the resolution:

From the Guardian’s Dani Anguiano, here’s more on the sentencing of David DePape, who broke into then-House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s home two years ago and bludgeoned her husband:

David DePape, a rightwing conspiracy theorist who broke into Nancy Pelosi’s northern California home in 2022 and bludgeoned her husband with a hammer, has been sentenced to 30 years in prison.

A federal jury convicted him of attempted kidnapping of a federal official and assault on the immediate family member of a federal official in November 2023, just over a year after the attack in the former House speaker’s San Francisco home.

DePape broke in through the back door in the early hours of 28 October 2022 with plans to kidnap Nancy Pelosi, interrogate her and post footage online. Instead, he found Paul Pelosi, who was 82 at the time and awoke to DePape in his bedroom with a hammer and zip ties, asking: “Where’s Nancy? Where’s Nancy?”

Paul Pelosi was able to call 911, and police officers arrived just before DePape struck him in the head multiple times with a hammer, knocking him unconscious. Pelosi required surgery for a skull fracture as well as injuries to his arm and hands after the attack, which was captured in police body-camera footage.

The former House speaker Nancy Pelosi has put out a statement after, David DePape, the attacker of her husband Paul Pelosi was sentenced to 30 years in prison for breaking into the family home and bludgeoning her husband with a hammer.

In a statement, a family spokesman for the applauded the bravery of Paul Pelosi during the night of the attack and subsequent trial.

From the spokesperson, Aaron Bennett:

The Pelosi family couldn’t be prouder of their Pop and his tremendous courage in saving his own life on the night of the attack and in testifying in this case. Speaker Pelosi and her family are immensely grateful to all who have sent love and prayers over the last eighteen months, as Mr Pelosi continues his recovery.

Given the ongoing state court proceedings, Speaker Pelosi and the Pelosi family will not be offering further comment on this matter at this time.

Here’s more on the allegations in Arizona against John Eastman, from the Associated Press:

The Arizona indictment said Eastman encouraged the GOP electors to cast their votes in December 2020, unsuccessfully pressured state lawmakers to change the election’s outcome in Arizona and told then-Vice President Mike Pence that he could reject Democratic electors in the counting of electoral votes in Congress on Jan. 6, 2021.

Trump himself was not charged in the Arizona case but was referred to as an unindicted co-conspirator.

Charges have not yet been made public against Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and Trump-aligned attorney, but he was readily identifiable based on descriptions of the defendants in the indictment. No arraignment date has been scheduled for Giuliani. Arizona authorities say they have been unable to serve Giuliani with the notice of the charges …

Last year, Eastman was indicted on racketeering, conspiracy and other charges in a scheme to overturn the 2020 president election in Georgia. He has pleaded not guilty to the Georgia charges. Eastman also is named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the sprawling federal indictment filed in Washington against Trump for working to overturn the results of the 2020 election in the run-up to the violent riot by his supporters at the U.S. Capitol.

Attorney John Eastman pleaded not guilty to fraud, conspiracy and forgery charges for his role in efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in favor of Donald Trump, the Associated Press reported.

Eastman is the first person in Arizona’s fake elector case to be arraigned. Eastman was charged after he attempted to create a plan to get Congress not to certify the 2020 election.

“I had zero communications with the electors in Arizona [and] zero involvement in any of the election litigation in Arizona or legislative hearings. And I am confident that with the laws faithfully applied, I will be fully be exonerated at the end of this process,” Eastman said in a brief statement outside the courthouse.

The day so far

Democrats are howling after the New York Times reported that a flag associated with Donald Trump’s false election fraud claims flew outside the house of Samuel Alito, a conservative supreme court justice. Dick Durbin, the Democratic chair of the Senate judiciary committee, called on Alito to recuse himself from cases involving Trump and the 2020 election – such as the ex-president’s petition for immunity from the federal charges related to his plot to keep Joe Biden from taking office. In a rare interview with Fox News, Alito said that the flag was flown by his wife after a confrontation with a neighbor.

Here’s a rundown of what has happened so far today:

Alito was among the conservative justices who appeared skeptical of the government’s arguments at a hearing over Trump’s immunity petition last month.

The banner flown from Alito’s house was an upside-down American flag, a traditional symbol of distress that became associated with support for Trump’s “stop the steal” movement.

fb570fb6ca,Fox News,Karen Read murder trial: Dashcam emerges from night of police officer boyfriend's death - Fox News,"Dashcam video shown in court during day three of Karen Read's murder trial was the public's first glimpse of the night Boston police officer John O'Keefe was killed, but the footage was obscured by heavy snowfall and police flashlights against the pitch-black night sky.

The video is about three minutes long and was initially played in a quiet courtroom, with no comment or questions from the prosecution or defense.

Then the lawyers sparred during first responders' testimony, where they gave conflicting accounts of what they heard. They described a ""frantic"" and ""distraught"" woman yelling, but what she actually said isn't clear.

One first responder testified that she had yelled, ""I hit him, I hit him, oh my God I hit him."" Another testified, ""He's dead. He's f---ing dead."" A third said a woman had yelled, ""Is he alive?""

The blurry dashcam clearly showed a commotion in front of the police vehicle, and first responders moving a gurney with O'Keefe's body to an ambulance.

But first responders had difficulty even distinguishing themselves in the footage from Jan. 29, 2022, outside of Boston police officer Brian Albert's home in Canton, Massachusetts, a Boston suburb.

That's when O'Keefe was found dead in four to six inches of snow in a T-shirt and missing a shoe.

PROSECUTORS FACE CHALLENGE WITH ‘UNDETERMINED’ CAUSE OF DEATH, EXPERT SAYS, AND WHAT HE'S LOOKING FOR

Read was charged with O'Keefe's murder. Prosecutors alleged she backed over her boyfriend, O'Keefe, with her Lexus SUV during an alcohol-fueled fight.

Read pleaded not guilty to all charges, and her defense team claimed she was framed in an elaborate cover-up to protect the Albert family, an influential family with ties to law enforcement, first responders and prosecutors in the area.

WATCH FULL DASHCAM VIDEO SHOWN IN COURT

Two Canton first responders, Fire Lt. Anthony Flematti and firefighter Kaite McLaughlin, testified that they had heard Read incriminate herself by repeatedly saying, ""I hit him.""

During cross-examination, Flematti seemingly walked back his original comments.

Read's high-powered attorney, Alan Jackson, asked him if he heard that phrase ""in any context either to the police or to the grand jury before today?""

""I don’t recall,"" Flematti responded.

Canton Fire Lt. Francis Walsh said he had heard a distraught woman yelling, ""He's dead. He's f---ing dead.""

Read's lawyer specifically asked Walsh whether it was ""easy for you to discern that her words were, 'He's dead. He's f---ing dead'?"" Walsh responded, ""Correct.""

He also testified that he heard a woman yell, ""Is he alive?""

""I think they were all over the map, weren’t they?"" one of Read's lawyers, David Yanetti, said about the testimonies heard Thursday. ""Everybody had a different version of what was said, and I think much of it was unreliable.""

After the trial's fiery opening statements, which included several stunning accusations from the defense, jurors heard testimony from the first responders, as well as O'Keefe's family.

On Friday, jurors visited the crime scene, as testimony continued.

fe6bc770f9,Financial Times,Wall Street wants Harris to turn the antitrust tide - Financial Times,"Dealmaking lawyers and bankers have opened up their pocketbooks and hearts to Kamala Harris. Wall Street’s love affair with the Democratic party traces back three decades to Bill Clinton. This time the Masters of the Universe may have a very specific request of Harris.

Joe Biden’s administration has approached corporate consolidation with a new, stricter lens, arguing that deals approved in previous eras now must not proceed. Private equity and venture capitalists are irritated because their portfolio companies, for example, cannot easily sell to Big Tech.

Elite lawyers and bankers are perhaps the most exercised by the Justice Department’s Jonathan Kanter and Federal Trade Commission’s Lina Khan, as advisers traffic in more deal volume. Coincidentally or not, many of these Biden critics have rushed to embrace Harris.

The Biden administration on the surface does not look that different from previous administrations in antitrust enforcement, according to a recent report from the Progressive Policy Institute think-tank. However, where it departs is its willingness to litigate to enjoin transaction closings rather than offer settlements. Biden’s win rate of just over 50 per cent trails the 80 per cent win rate of the Obama years.

Under Biden, the antitrust watchdogs are going to court more — and losing at a higher rate, given the more novel economic theories deployed. The administration also has its set of noteworthy wins including halting a book publisher combination between Penguin Random House and Simon & Schuster that would have cut advances for elite writers.

The banker Ken Moelis noted on his company’s earnings call this week that the mere spectre of a lengthy antitrust review has discouraged boards of directors from pursuing transformative deals.

The dealmaker crowd that resents the Biden administration rarely offers any principled critique of its trustbusters; the sense is merely that their approach threatens year-end bonuses. Few Americans could pick Lina Khan out of a line-up and to the extent they have a view on corporate mergers, they do not like them. As it happens, Donald Trump’s vice-presidential nominee, JD Vance, has previously praised Khan’s worldview.

Biden was a different kind of Democrat willing to actively embrace labour unions and experiment with a less markets-first ideology. Plenty of finance bigwigs gritted their teeth because of their aversion to Trump. Their hope is that Harris would mark a return to business-as-usual. She has yet to place a stake in the antitrust turf but the pressure coming on all sides of the debate will be enormous.","A woman in a white blazer is holding a smartphone, smiling, and appears to be in a professional setting with other people in the background.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA4A397B0>,2024-07-28 04:00:17.968000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/54477594-976f-467c-857e-e695f3c7642f,['Business and Finance' 'Politics'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/fe6bc770f9.png
f009ae0eab,CBS News,Home equity levels are near record highs. Here are 5 ways to access it. - CBS News,"It's safe to say that the housing market has been a bit bleak for potential homebuyers over the last few years. Not only are mortgage loan rates substantially higher than they were just a few years ago, but limited for-sale home inventory and elevated home prices have made it more difficult for buyers to find homes that are both affordable and available.

But that narrative is quite different for today's homeowners. Thanks to a mix of sustained demand and low inventory levels, the average homeowner has experienced rapid growth in their home equity since the start of 2021. And, according to recent data from CoreLogic, the total home equity for U.S. mortgage holders soared to more than $17 trillion in the first quarter of 2024 — just shy of the record set in the third quarter of 2023.

That uptick amounts to an increase of about $28,000 in home equity over the past year for the average homeowner. In turn, homeowners have, on average, about $305,000 in home equity currently — a 70% increase compared to pre-pandemic levels. So, if you're a homeowner who needs to borrow money at an affordable rate, borrowing against your home's equity can be a smart option to consider right now — and there are a few different ways you can access it.

Find out what the most affordable home equity borrowing options are for you.

5 ways to tap access home equity now

Here are some home equity borrowing options that may be worth considering right now:

Borrow a lump sum with a home equity loan

A home equity loan is a lump-sum loan that's secured by the value of your home. With a home equity loan, you borrow against your equity and receive the funds upfront. The benefit of this approach lies in its simplicity. You receive a fixed amount of money to use as you see fit, and home equity loan repayment terms are typically fixed, allowing for easy budgeting.

And, in today's high-rate environment, home equity loans are one of the most affordable borrowing options, too. Right now, for example, home equity loan rates are hovering near 8.63% overall — but the average rates on other borrowing options, like personal loans and credit cards, are well into the double digits.

But while a home equity loan can be an affordable option to consider, it's important to note that a home equity loan is a second mortgage. Failure to make timely payments on your home equity loan could put your home at risk of foreclosure, so it's important to focus on responsible borrowing if you want to take this route.

Compare today's best home equity borrowing options online now.

Utilize a HELOC to gain a line of credit

A home equity line of credit (HELOC) works similarly to a home equity loan in that you borrow against your home's equity with a second mortgage that's secured by the value of your home. However, there are a couple of big differences.

Unlike home equity loans, the rates tied to HELOCs are variable, so they can change with the overall rate environment. And, rather than a lump-sum loan, a HELOC functions like a revolving credit line, allowing you to borrow against your home's equity as needed, up to a predetermined limit.

This flexibility makes it a popular choice for ongoing expenses or multiple projects, as you only pay interest on the amount you actually borrow. And, in a high-rate environment where rates are expected to decline in the future, borrowing money with a HELOC could be a smart move, as there's a potential for the rate to drop over time.

However, the variable interest rates can also make a HELOC a risky choice for certain borrowers (and in certain rate environments). That's because the rate on a HELOC could also increase depending on the overall rate environment, meaning that your payments could also increase over time, potentially straining your budget.

Consider whether a cash-out refinance makes sense

With a cash-out refinance, you replace your existing mortgage with a new, larger loan and receive the difference in cash. This option can be advantageous if you can secure a lower interest rate than your current mortgage, potentially reducing your monthly payments and freeing up funds for other purposes.

However, if you're a homeowner who secured a low rate during the pandemic, you may not want to refinance to a mortgage loan with a significantly higher rate. After all, a higher rate would result in higher monthly mortgage payments (and more paid in interest over the life of the loan). And, the closing costs and the extended loan term tied to this equity borrowing option can offset some of the benefits.

Turn your equity into cash with a reverse mortgage

If you're a homeowner age 62 or older, a reverse mortgage could be worth considering. With a reverse mortgage, you're able to convert a portion of your home's equity into cash without having to make monthly mortgage payments.

In turn, this option can provide a much-needed source of income during retirement, alleviating some of your financial stress and allowing you to age in place. However, it's crucial to understand the potential impact on your estate and the costs associated with this type of loan, as well as the potential tax implications, before taking this route.

Downsize and access your equity without borrowing

While not a loan per se, downsizing to a smaller, more affordable home can help you unlock a significant portion of your home's equity. This option can be particularly appealing for ""empty-nesters"" or those seeking a simpler lifestyle, as it not only provides access to funds but also reduces ongoing maintenance and housing costs.

However, the process of selling and relocating can be emotionally and logistically challenging, and you may need to factor in additional expenses, such as selling and moving costs or potential renovations, to determine whether it's the right move for you.

The bottom line

By responsibly tapping into your home's equity, you may be able to borrow the money you need at an affordable rate — which is unusual in today's elevated rate environment. But while today's near-record-high levels of home equity present an enticing opportunity, it's crucial to approach your borrowing options with a long-term perspective in mind. And, remember that each option carries its own set of risks and benefits, so what may work for one homeowner may not be suitable for another. So, be sure to weigh all of your options to find the one that works best for your unique situation.",A silver calculator with a house-shaped keyhole on its keypad is placed on top of a stack of US dollar bills with the word 'LOAN' visible on the left side.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BDA730F70>,2024-06-18 17:20:04+00:00,https://www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/home-equity-levels-are-near-record-highs-ways-to-access-it/,['Business and Finance' 'National'],[0.95 0.75],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/f009ae0eab.png
3f73e46d11,Financial Times,"Now everyone is worried about France, is it time to buy European stocks? - Financial Times","Fear not, I am done writing about investment trusts. Now I just need to buy one. We also lost a couple of weekends, didn’t we, pondering how to join the private equity cowboys? I still want in here, too — most likely via a fund of listed players.

Both closed-ended funds and private equity are out of favour. This always makes me vibrate like a tumble drier. (Beat that, Dr Dre!) But now there’s a new asset class jiggling my contrarian bones: European equities.

Everyone lost it when populists did well in Europe’s parliamentary elections this month. President Macron then compounded matters by calling a snap poll, with investors fretting over Marine Le Pen’s far-right party and the leftwing Nouveau Front Populaire.

Markets spasmed. French stocks dropped 7 per cent in a little over a week before recovering some. European bond yields rose, credit spreads widened, and many fear a Liz Truss-style convulsion in France as both ends of the political spectrum seem lax on finances.

All of which has spoiled the party a bit. Despite Germany’s economy being in a funk and gross government debt levels versus output in Spain, Italy and France exceeding 100 per cent, the bloc’s equity markets have boogied since January.

I’d been watching them from the sidelines, unfortunately. As you can see, my portfolio has no exposure to European assets whatsoever. Hence I missed out on the 9 per cent rise in the Stoxx 600 ex-UK index before the latest slip.

This never felt as lonesome as my zero in US shares — they are up 15 per cent this year. But it pains me because continental Europe accounts for roughly a tenth of the Morningstar 60-80 per cent equity index against which I measure my returns.

Why haven’t I owned any European companies? For the same reason I’ve been wrong about US ones since October. I’ve often mentioned my first boss who used to say, “never bet against America”. Well he also warned: “Never overestimate Europe.”

This had nothing to do with growth or productivity — both are often higher than we achieve in the UK. Nor politics, which is no more or less volatile than elsewhere. Greece even topped The Economist global economic rankings last year.

Sure, we purists bemoan the incongruity of a single currency zone made up of discrete fiscal-raising entities. Or that a single monetary policy cannot possibly be appropriate for all 20 members of the Eurozone at once.

No, my boss’s negative view was more about returns on equity. As with Japan, the fact was that managers and employees of continental businesses simply didn’t obsess themselves with shareholders as US ones did. And they still don’t.

It’s a cliché that German engineers would rather make a perfect turbine, Italians beautiful handbags, and the French nothing, it’s summer. But as a fund manager I visited thousands of companies. You can tell who cares about their stock price.

Europe will never outdo the US on this score (no one will, to be fair.) So it is no surprise that the S&P 500 has outperformed European ex-UK shares by almost five times over the past two decades. Likewise, there are only three European names in the MSCI World’s top 30 and not a trillion-dollar valuation in sight.

As with liars and philanderers, form matters when it comes to trusting an investment. Fundamentals rarely change. If this was the only consideration, however, I would own US stocks. Prices get out of whack. Short- or medium-term opportunities pop up.

Is this recent drop in European shares one of them? To answer this question it first pays to know what I would be buying. Like my analysis of Asian funds, the sweeping term “Europe” covers a disparate collection of nations and businesses.

I don’t like where the concentration is — on either side of the pond. In the US it’s all artificial intelligence

I’m going to focus on the Stoxx 600 ex-UK index, as it’s much broader than the Stoxx 50 and I already own UK stocks. Something about the former that immediately appeals is the low concentration risk — despite a heavy tilt towards France.

For example, the top five companies in the S&P 500 make up a quarter of the index, roughly 50 per cent more concentrated than in Europe. That’s fine for some — indeed the narrower Stoxx 50 index is spookily aligned with the S&P 500 in terms of concentration.

Trouble is, I don’t like where the concentration is — on either side of the pond. In the US it’s all artificial intelligence. As me old mucker Robert Armstrong calculated last week, AI is responsible for all the gains in the S&P 500 since the end of March. The rest of the market is down.

Sure, I’ve missed the rally in Nvidia, but I don’t want to own it now on 20 times forward revenues (you read that right: revenues, not profits). Nor in Europe do I like that Novo Nordisk — manufacturer of blubber-shredder drugs and top name in the Stoxx 600 ex-UK index — has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of almost 40 times.

But even Super Novo is only 5 per cent the benchmark — compared with Nvidia and Microsoft at 6.5 and 7 per cent of the S&P 500 respectively. And while Dutch chipmaker ASML has ridden the AI boom, it has a smaller weight again at number two.

And I’m partial to the rest of the top 10, frankly. LVMH and SAP are world leaders. Meanwhile, food, energy and numerous other pharma companies spew cash flow.

Is Europe cheap enough for me to justify selling one of my other funds to pay for it though? The trailing price/earnings ratio even of the concentrated Stoxx 50 is 14 times, according to Bloomberg data.

That makes my FTSE 100 fund seem dear after its strong run this year. Likewise, Japan and Asia. Sorry boss, I may have to look into this a little more.","An image with a blurred background featuring five stars, with one large yellow star and four smaller blue stars, possibly representing a rating or level of importance.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA484EAD0>,2024-06-28 10:00:27.995000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/f32a77f3-d46a-45c7-b869-fec66a53bd7d,['Business and Finance' 'Politics'],[0.85 0.75],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/3f73e46d11.png
7f946837cf,Forbes,Keir Starmers First Test As Uk Overtaken With Riots - Forbes,"One month after the new Labour government has taken power, the country has been engulfed in riots – in the north and south – that are ostensibly driven by far-right groups, and at the same time Muslim youths in cities like Bolton.

The riots were triggered by the murder of three children in a stabbing attack in Southport, and a specific tactic has been to target hotels and accommodation centres used for asylum seekers.

The tactics deployed in the riots appear to be coordinated on social media (by far right groups and potentially other actors), and are suspiciously all too similar to the pattern of recent riots in Ireland.

For background, in November 2023 following a knife attack on a group of children in Dublin (by an alleged migrant) riots erupted in the city centre , and recently there have been violent protests in Dublin (against the housing of asylum seekers). At the time I had spoken to a number of European experts on the ‘far-right’, who mentioned that within an hour of the Dublin protests starting, far-right WhatsApp groups across Europe were animated.

This suggests that there is an element of coordination by the far-right in the violent protests (as well as a template for action), which have happened in many cities. Of interest, Irish far-right groups (of which there are few) have joined far-right protest groups in Belfast (unionists/loyalists), and historically it would have been unimaginable for them to combine.

There are several policy strands here.

The first relates to the policing effort and here police forces across the UK are severely stretched (police chiefs have described the violence as ‘staggering’). There will also be efforts by the security forces to track and halt the coordination of the attacks. The scale of the attacks is weighing not only on the police but also on the criminal justice system (which needs reform and money, and the prison system (already over crowded).

A growing element in the violence is the use of social media to coordinate attacks, and the partisan position of the X owner Elon Musk. Though it is early, we feel that there will be a policy backlash and it is not unlikely that we see a tougher approach to curb the use of social media for ‘hate’ and violent protest. Currently, the UK has the Online Safety Act, whose financially unitive elements only come into force at the end of this year (from when regulators can fine platforms that produce illegal content 10% of revenues). There is scope (need) to introduce further measures to curb hateful and extremist content.

Second, the timing of the protests during the ‘honeymoon’ period for the Labour government is also suspicious and will represent the first test for Keir Starmer.

Thirdly, and from a longer-term point of view, Labour had identified the degradation of social infrastructure across the UK in its manifesto, and the effects of over a decade of austerity on cities outside London is very clear. In addition, the poor integration of mostly Muslim immigrants in UK cities will get greater policy attention, and immigration now becomes an even bigger policy issue. This may bolster support for the small Reform party and could also colour the Tory party leadership contest (the violence is as much a statement about the Tory legacy).

In summary, Keir Starmer’s first test as prime minister is upon him, and the stance he takes (twenty years ago he prosecuted groups involved in similar riots) will define his premiership. We expect him to bolster the police, clampdown on both the rioters and the use of social media to foment trouble. Two far greater tasks, are managing immigration and renewing Britain’s crumbling social infrastructure.",A man in a suit and tie stands in front of a blurred background with a British flag.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BC76DCD30>,2024-08-08 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.forbes.com,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeosullivan/2024/08/08/keir-starmers-first-test-as-uk-overtaken-with-riots/,['Politics' 'National'],[0.85 0.8 ],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/7f946837cf.png
f38d19b23f,CBS Minnesota,National and Minnesota leaders react after Gov. Tim Walz picked as Kamala Harris' VP running mate - CBS Minnesota,"MINNEAPOLIS — Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate in the 2024 election — and it's prompting a wide array of reactions from leaders around the state and throughout the country.

Harris announced Tuesday morning that the Midwestern progressive will join her on the ticket heading into the November election. Harris and Walz will campaign in all seven battleground states in the coming days, beginning with an appearance in Philadelphia on Tuesday, Walz's first event as Harris' running mate.

""As a governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran, he's delivered for working families like his,"" Harris said. ""It's great to have him on the team. Now let's get to work.""

Walz called it an ""honor of a lifetime"" to join Harris in the ticket and said he's ""all in.""

National response

President Biden, who last month decided to step down from his reelection bid, said Harris made a ""great decision"" in choosing Walz as her running mate.

""I've known Tim Walz for nearly two decades, first during his time in Congress and as Governor. A husband and father, he's been a school teacher and a high school football coach. He served for 24 years in the Army National Guard and became the highest ranking enlisted soldier to ever serve in Congress. As Governor, he's been a strong, principled, and effective leader,"" Mr. Biden said.

Mr. Biden says the ticket is a ""powerful voice for working people and America's great middle class"" and that it's time for Democrats and all Americans to rally behind the ticket.

Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who were among those being vetted as potential running mates, also issued statements.

Kelly said Harris and Walz ""are going to move us forward"" and are ""already building a campaign to unite our country,"" while Shapiro said his work in his state is ""far from finished"" and that he's looking forward to uniting residents of his state behind Harris and Walz.

Former President Donald Trump's presidential campaign called Walz a ""radical leftist"" in its statement.

""It's no surprise that San Francisco Liberal Kamala Harris wants West Coast wannabe Tim Walz as her running-mate - Walz has spent his governorship trying to reshape Minnesota in the image of the Golden State,"" Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. ""While Walz pretends to support Americans in the Heartland, when the cameras are off, he believes that rural America is 'mostly cows and rocks'. From proposing his own carbon-free agenda, to suggesting stricter emission standards for gas-powered cars, and embracing policies to allow convicted felons to vote, Walz is obsessed with spreading California's dangerously liberal agenda far and wide. If Walz won't tell voters the truth, we will: just like Kamala Harris, Tim Walz is a dangerously liberal extremist, and the Harris-Walz California dream is every American's nightmare.""

Trump's vice presidential nominee, Sen. JD Vance, said Harris' selection of Walz ""highlights just how radical Kamala Harris is.""

""This is a person who listened to the Hamas wing of her own party in selecting a nominee,"" Vance told reporters Tuesday. ""This is a guy who's proposed shipping more manufacturing jobs to China, who wants to make the American people more reliant on garbage energy instead of good, American energy, and has proposed defunding the police just as Kamala Harris does.""

Vance also said he tried calling Walz and left a voicemail congratulating him.

Minnesota leaders react

Leaders in Minnesota were quick to react to the news, including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who called it a ""great pick"" for Harris.

""I can't wait for the rest of the country to get to know @Tim_Walz,"" Frey said on X. ""Cheers to the ticket that's going to energize people across the nation.""

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison called the pick an ""extremely wise choice,"" that shows Harris is ""smart, bold and ready to win."" He also called Walz ""accessible, friendly"" and an ""ally of Americans working hard for a living.""

U.S. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, a Republican from Minnesota, said it's ""not surprising"" Harris picked Walz.

""He embodies the same disastrous economic, open-borders, and soft-on-crime policies Harris has inflicted on our country the last four years,"" Emmer said on X. ""Walz is an empty suit who has worked to turn Minnesota into Harris' home state of California, and solidifies this ticket's full embrace of a radical, America-last agenda.""

Minnesota Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson, R-East Grand Fork, said the Harris-Walz ticket will be the ""most extreme and far-left in history.""

""Walz ran on a 'One Minnesota' theme, but governed with a 'One Extreme Minnesota' platform,"" Johnson said in a statement. ""The Harris/Walz tandem will make the cost of living even more expensive for Americans, encourage unchecked illegal immigration, and further divide our country - as he did with our state. Tim Walz failed to unite Minnesotans by pushing an extreme agenda and lost nearly $500 million taxpayer dollars to waste fraud and abuse. He will do the same as part of this far-left presidential ticket.

Dean Phillips, who represented Minnesota's 3rd Congressional District until he briefly ran for president, said on X that Walz is a ""common-sense, competent, and experienced leader whose refreshing normal-ness will be a great contrast to the tiresome weirdness.""

Walz has also received support from Rep. Ilhan Omar and Sen. Tina Smith, as well as Sen. Amy Klobuchar.

""Minnesota is known as the land of Vice Presidents, and we've got another great one on the way! As a veteran, a high school teacher and a football coach, and our Minnesota Governor, Tim Walz has been an incredible leader (and on top of that, a good friend). Let's go win this!"" Klobuchar said on X.

Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, who would make history as the state's first female governor and first Native American woman to serve as governor in the country's history if Harris and Walz win the election, said Walz has he ""grit and the grace to keep our country moving forward alongside Kamala Harris.""

Walz had been in the mix of top contenders for the pick since late last month, along with along with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.

Walz was among several Democratic governors who visited the White House amid calls for Mr. Biden to drop his reelection bid following the first presidential debate. Soon after Mr. Biden announced he was leaving the race, Walz quickly fell in line with the majority of Democrats to endorse Harris.

Just days before Mr. Biden's announcement, Minnesota Congresswoman Betty McCollum joined the chorus of Democrats calling on him to step down. She then went further to throw Walz's name in as a possible vice presidential candidate.

After the Walz announcement on Tuesday morning, McCollum said Harris had made an ""excellent, insightful choice.""

""Tim Walz is my friend and a former colleague whose Midwest values are rooted in selfless service to our nation, caring for his neighbors, and inspiring students, soldiers, and citizens to stand together, dream bigger, and never give up. Tim is a rock-solid Democrat, a teacher, a football coach, a veteran and a leader who will defend our freedoms and will work to improve the lives of All Americans in every corner of our country,"" McCollum added.

WCCO's Esme Murphy asked Walz about his VP prospects before the announcement, but his response was both calculated and cagey.

""I don't think you turn down a job that you haven't been offered, but I have the best job in the world in being the governor of Minnesota,"" Walz said.

When pressed again about his possible candidacy during a separate event, Walz made it clear that he wasn't going to speak on the matter and reiterated his full support for Harris. He did, however, quip to reporters about the surrealness of hearing his name being tossed about.

""I've seen it out there and it's a little weird (laughs)!"" Walz said.

Now in his second term as governor, Walz, 60, also served 12 years as a U.S. congressman before his successful 2018 run to lead the state.","An older man with glasses and a white shirt is seen from the side, wearing a dark suit jacket, standing in front of a blurred background that suggests an outdoor setting.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BA2707820>,2024-08-06 13:56:00+00:00,https://www.cbsnews.com,https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minnesota-leaders-react-after-gov-walz-picked-as-kamala-harris-running-mate/,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.9 ],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/f38d19b23f.png
ad5c5798fa,Forbes,Jack Black Says Tenacious D Will Be Back After Trump Assassination Joke Canceled Tour: ‘These Things Take Time’ - Forbes,"Topline

Actor Jack Black has said his two-person band, Tenacious D, will make a comeback when the time is right after he canceled the remainder of a world tour following an off-color joke made on stage about the assassination attempt against former president Donald Trump last month.

Key Facts

At the premiere for the movie ""Borderlands"" Tuesday night, Black told Variety he and bandmate Kyle Gass needed to ""take a break"" after the comment, but said they are still friends and will ""be back when it feels right.""

Gass was blowing out birthday candles on stage during a tour stop in Sydney, Australia on July 14, the day after a man fired gunshots at Trump during a campaign rally, when he was asked to make a wish.

He replied ""Don't miss Trump next time,"" a reference to the assassination attempt.

The band canceled its remaining 10 sold-out stops and “all future creative plans” after the comment and Black said he would ""never condone hate speech or encourage political violence in any form.""

Australian senator Ralph Babet called for Black and Gass to have their visas revoked and for the pair to be kicked out of the country over the joke, and said ""Anything less than a deportation is an endorsement of the shooting and the attempted assassination of Donald J. Trump.”

Gass subsequently apologized for the remark, calling it “highly inappropriate, dangerous and a terrible mistake.”

Key Background

Trump was speaking at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania when several shots were fired from hundreds of yards away. The FBI later identified Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, as the gunman. A bullet grazed the former president’s ear before he was ushered off stage by Secret Service, and he was quickly released from a nearby hospital after an evaluation. Several other people at the rally were shot and one was killed. Authorities have still not identified a movie in the attack. Prior to the assassination attempt, Black was a vocal supporter of President Joe Biden's campaign for president and was a featured speaker at a Biden fundraiser in Los Angeles, during which he told the audience “democracy is at stake.”

63a0f4752b,Financial Times,Tunisian presidential candidate arrested ahead of October election - Financial Times,"One of only two candidates approved to run against Tunisia’s authoritarian president Kais Saied in next month’s election was arrested on Monday, the same day his name appeared on the list of approved candidates.

Ayachi Zammel was taken into custody in the early hours, shortly before he was named as a candidate for the October 6 vote by the electoral commission.

Mahdi Abdel Jawad, a member of Zammel’s campaign, told Express FM, a Tunisian broadcaster, that the arrest appeared linked to “false” allegations that the campaign had forged endorsements from members of the public to secure Zammel’s candidacy.

“The allegations aim at tarnishing the image of Zammel,” said Abdel Jawad.

Although Zammel made it on to the list, the commission whose members have been handpicked by Saied refused to include three other politicians, seen as potentially strong competitors to the president. This despite recent court rulings reinstating them as presidential candidates.

Saied has conducted repeated crackdowns against his political opponents, as well as journalists and civil society workers, since he staged a power grab in 2021. He has since then proceeded to dismantle Tunisia’s fledgling democratic experiment launched after the country’s 2011 uprising.

Zammel, a businessman and former MP, had maintained a low-profile according to Hamza Meddeb, analyst at the Carnegie Middle East Center, but some Saied opponents had begun to see him as someone they could potentially “bet on”.

“He initially supported Saied’s power grab, then started taking a distance from him,” said Meddeb. “Some are saying why not play the Zammel card. At least he is an independent.”

Meddeb said the entry of the three politicians excluded by the electoral commission would have been “a game-changer for the election”, because they could mobilise sections of the public that might otherwise have stayed home.

“It would have ensured competition and that Saied did not win from the first round,” said Meddeb.

The three are Mondher Znaidi, a long serving former minister who appeals to a constituency nostalgic for the stability of the pre-revolution regime; Imed Dleimi, said to have support among younger Tunisians and circles which backed the 2011 uprising; and Abdel Latif Mekki, who appeals to an Islamist constituency.

“Even those tempted to boycott the election could have been mobilised,” said Meddeb. “It is clear Zammel is being harassed to prevent him from conducting a campaign under normal conditions.”

Before Saied concentrated powers in his hands, Tunisia was seen as the only successful transition to democracy to have emerged from the Arab uprisings of 13 years ago.

The other candidate approved to run against Saied is Zouhair Maghzaoui, head of the al-Shaab party, which has supported the president’s assault on Tunisia’s democratic institutions.

Ahead of the announcement by the electoral commission of the approved candidates, dozens of civil society organisations, political and public figures condemned what they saw as an intention to ignore the court rulings.

They said in a statement over the weekend that “the non implementation of the decisions of the administrative court . . . has no legal basis . . . and leads to harm in the form of punishable electoral fraud”.","A man in a black suit and red tie sits with his hand on his chin, appearing to be deep in thought.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA49A3E50>,2024-09-02 17:09:05.932000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/424017b0-6d1a-4542-a93b-4dfcbe77ea4c,['Politics'],[0.95],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/63a0f4752b.png
095592da0f,National Review,"Songs, Words, Life - National Review","My column today is a smorgasbord, touching on identity politics (the curse of), presidential immunity (and the recent Supreme Court decision), and Ismail Kadare (the late Albanian novelist). There’s more too. Here.

Let’s have some mail. In a post last week, I said, “. . . for ‘Desperado,’ I’ll forgive Don Henley almost anything.” (Never mind the context. That need not detain us.) A “wonderful song,” I said, “especially when sung by other people.” An unkind cut, but honest.

A reader writes,

I’m with you on “Desperado.” What a song. A beautiful song and, in my listening, a very spiritual (dare I say “Christian”?) song. “You better let somebody love you . . .”

Forty years ago, I was working the sound board for a little band of Christian guys who would go into jails and prisons and do concerts — mostly rock covers with double meanings, such as “I Ain’t Got You,” with a few good Christian songs.

I could tell a number of stories, but I’ll tell just this: The highlight of every performance was “Desperado.” The perfect song in the program. The room often got a little pensive.

I can see it, hear it.

Another reader writes,

I agree that “Desperado” is better when sung by others, and thought I’d share a recent version sung by one of my favorite bands. If you’re not already familiar with the Petersens, they’re what you find when you look up “wholesome” in the dictionary. A family bluegrass band whose members seem to really enjoy one another, and who are straightforwardly Christian without being obnoxious about it.

Anyway, if you haven’t seen this already, I hope you enjoy it.

Here is the video.

A little language? A reader writes,

We were reading The Grapes of Wrath in school, and I went to the teacher and asked her what a “gutache” was. The word is spoken by one of the Joad kids, if I remember correctly. I pronounced it “GOO-tash.”

The teacher laughed and replied, crisply, “Gut ache.”

My mom uses “gutache” to this day — pronounced my way.

Stick with words for a minute. In a recent column, I wrote,

One of the most interesting and enjoyable words in our language is “Oi.” Did I say “our”? Well, you hear this word in Britain. Grammarians classify it as an “interjection.” The TV series Ted Lasso, which is about a London soccer team, is replete with it.

I recall something from Boris Johnson’s time as mayor. He said to a young man sitting across from him, “Oi, there’s no eatin’ on the Tube.”

Classic.

Well, a friend informs me that “oi” — or, to render it correctly, “Oi!” — is “also a genre of music. Skinhead and skinhead-adjacent.” Ah. To read an article about this by Alexis Petridis in the Guardian, go here.

Finally, apropos of nothing — and everything — a reader writes,

Jay,

I’ve often wondered what it was like to be alive at certain moments in history. Moments that historians have designated “life-changing.” The Declaration of Independence: July 4, 1776. Lincoln’s assassination: April 15, 1865. Armistice Day: November 11, 1918. The stock-market crash: October 29, 1929. The Nazi invasion of Poland: September 1, 1939. Pearl Harbor: December 7, 1941.

I was alive for the Kennedy assassination. I was ten years old. They dismissed us from school early. In my immaturity, I thought this was cool. JFK’s death seemed like TV fiction.

So, let’s buckle our seatbelts. The presidential election on November 5, 2024, will be a day that future historians will garnish with superlatives. If I’m alive on that Tuesday, I must remember. When the sun rises on Wednesday, November 6, 2024, America will never be the same.

Yikes. Anyway, have a good week.

Hang on, one more thing: Up above, I said I preferred others in Don Henley’s “Desperado.” May I revise and extend my remarks? Henley wrote the damn thing — wonderful thing — along with Glenn Frey. Honestly, he can sing it however the hell he wants. And “who can gainsay it?” (I have borrowed Buckley language.)

As I have related before, I heard Leontyne Price sing Lee Hoiby’s “Where the Music Comes From” many times. Then I heard the composer himself sing it (accompanying himself on the piano). He was probably about 80 then. And it was so . . . so . . . real. I realized that the song was a deeply personal — almost prayerful — soft-rock song, not an art song (though, God, Leontyne was good in it). Hoiby himself called it “my Cat Stevens song.”

I can hear it now, from both the luminous soprano and the rather hoarse, octogenarian composer.

49944a2b1c,Financial Times,The UK nuclear fusion start-up helping the US develop stealth submarines - Financial Times,"In the 1990 film The Hunt for Red October, a Soviet naval captain played by Sean Connery pilots a submarine powered by a “magnetohydrodynamic drive” that is undetectable to military sonar.

More than 30 years later, UK start-up Tokamak Energy is supporting a US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency programme to make silent marine propulsion a reality.

The collaboration with Darpa is one of several ways the nuclear fusion company is seeking to monetise a decade of work on high temperature superconductor magnets, which it argues can transform sectors from public transport to medical imaging.

“What we want to do here is usher in the HTS era,” said Liam Brennan, director of TE Magnetics, which Tokamak Energy will officially launch next week. “We want to get those magnets out there and get them operating.”

Spun-out of the UK Atomic Energy Authority in 2009, Tokamak Energy’s principal business is nuclear fusion, where the Oxfordshire-based company is vying with about 40 others worldwide to be the first to develop a power plant capable of producing commercially viable clean power by fusing hydrogen isotopes.

The prospect of recreating the reaction that powers the sun has tantalised scientists for decades. The carbon-free reaction creates no long-lived radioactive waste, the isotopes can be sourced in large quantities, and a small cup of the fuel has the potential to power a house for hundreds of years.

But after 60 years of experiments no group has been able to perfect the technology and there is no guarantee the dream of fusion power plants will be realised.

The most common approach to fusion uses magnets to suspend a plasma of two isotopes — normally deuterium and tritium — in a device called a tokamak. The isotopes are then heated to extreme temperatures 10 times hotter than the centre of the sun so the nuclei fuse, producing helium and energy.

The first generation of magnets used in experimental tokamaks such as JET in Oxfordshire, which began operations in 1983, were made of copper. More recent facilities, such as China’s EAST, which produced its first plasma in 2006, use so-called low temperature superconductor magnets.

Tokamak Energy will use its specially designed HTS magnets wound from groundbreaking tape that can generate a much stronger magnetic field, at higher temperatures, than LTS magnets. The crucial component in the copper-covered tape is a layer — about the width of a human hair — of superconducting material rare earth barium copper oxide.

Whereas LTS materials have to be cooled using expensive liquid helium to temperatures close to absolute zero (minus 273C), rebco tape exhibits superconducting properties at roughly minus 200C, making HTS-based systems potentially cheaper and more powerful.

Tokamak Energy in 2019 built and tested the world’s highest-field HTS magnet, achieving a record 24 tesla field at a temperature of minus 253C. The magnets in the JET device, which was decommissioned this year, could only generate magnetic fields of up to 4 tesla.

“We’ve shown with our magnets that we can make them very reliable, stable and consistent, and that’s the tipping point,” said Brennan. “This couldn’t be done seven years ago.”

Tokamak Energy’s advances in magnet technology are vital to its fusion plans. Whereas most existing tokamaks are doughnut-shaped, it plans to build a more compact spherical one, which will require the machine’s magnets to perform as efficiently as possible.

It aims to build a pilot plant capable of delivering electricity into the grid in the early 2030s. The UK government’s next fusion device, STEP, will use a similar design.

To test the science and engineering in its magnets, Tokamak Energy has built a demonstration device at its facility outside Oxford. When completed this year it will stand 3.2 metres tall and include 44 magnetic coils of HTS tape arranged in a spherical formation around a central core. The machine will replicate the forces required in a fusion power plant, producing a magnetic field of 18 tesla, nearly a million times stronger than the Earth’s magnetic field.

However, the potential applications of HTS magnets extend beyond fusion. The ability to operate without the need for costly liquid-helium cooling and a high tolerance to vibration makes HTS magnets ideal for use in MRI scanners in hospitals and other scientific imaging equipment that currently use LTS materials, Brennan said. He said other applications of the superconducting qualities of HTS could also include shrinking the size of electric motors for trains.

The Darpa programme on maritime propulsion requires HTS magnets, he said, because it is seeking to build magnetohydrodynamic drives that produce magnetic fields of 20 tesla.

The only such drive tested to date was developed by Japan’s Mitsubishi in the 1990s and then abandoned. The drive generated a magnetic field of approximately 4 tesla, which successfully propelled a 30-metre boat but only at speeds of 6.6 knots (about 12 km/h).

By selling its magnet expertise to other fusion companies and industries, Tokamak Energy says it can ease its future funding requirements. Private sector fusion companies have raised about $7bn in investment to date but fundraising is challenging as long as revenues from commercial fusion power remain at least a decade away.

Tokamak Energy, which employees about 250 people, is in the middle of another funding round having previously raised $250mn from private investors and government grants. At least $50mn of that has been spent on magnet development.

“It’s a very difficult investment story because your typical venture capital investors are looking for a return in a defined period of time, and the magnets business helps us there because we can actually point to a return,” said Christian Lowis, the company’s general counsel.

The company has already signed HTS-related contracts with several customers and estimates TE Magnetics could generate £8mn in annual revenues next year and £300mn a year by the end of the decade.

“Key to our model is owning the design of the magnets,” Lowis said. “Whether we manufacture the magnets, subcontract the manufacture to somebody else, sublicence the IP to somebody else or even sublicence them to another fusion company for them to manufacture themselves, they’re all potential options.”

6f05ba573d,Financial Times,Is economics in need of trustbusting? - Financial Times,"The standard advice from economists about concentrated market power is that it is inefficient, unfair and should be broken up or regulated. The standard retort from concentrated industries is that they are merely super-efficient at the business they do.

But what if the concentrated business is economists themselves? A study documents a “high and rising” concentration of Nobel Prize winners in a handful of top US universities: more than half their combined career time has been spent at just eight economics departments. Equivalent measures for other disciplines, from natural sciences to the humanities, are going the other way.

There are other signs of economics turning into an elite closed shop: the handful of journals acting as gatekeepers to career advancement are largely controlled by economists from the same top departments, who also disproportionately pass through the revolving doors into policymaking jobs.

This cartelisation may have similar causes to concentration elsewhere, from “superstar” dynamics enabled by information technology to the tendency of financial advantage to compound. But does it lead to wasted resources and inferior output, as in other markets?

There are many things economics does well. Over the past century it has vastly improved governments’ ability to manage the business cycle and limit rises in unemployment. Its insistence on logical argument and careful use of (albeit often imperfect) data can hold public policy to account in a way no other social science can.

Yet there is no shortage of criticisms to lay at the profession’s door: from its infamous collective failure to spot a global financial crisis in the making and too-slow alarm at inequality or rent-seeking, to its excessive confidence that people act in their informed interest and a huge disconnect between how economists and the general public think about the economy. The question is to what extent such shortcomings are caused by institutional concentration.

There is certainly a case to be made that narrow gatekeeping and a steep hierarchy of prestige foster groupthink overseen by a self-perpetuating priesthood. After all, economics itself has models — from informational cascades to herding behaviour — explaining how the pivotal influence of a few can entrench inferior outcomes. When career incentives and social pressures concentrate influence in a small group, neither big policy mistakes nor petty personal abuse should surprise anyone.

Of course, elite institutions have their dissenters: a Dani Rodrik (Harvard) on trade and financial liberalisation, a Raghuram Rajan (Chicago) on financial deregulation, or a Richard Thaler (Chicago) on how people do not behave as economists traditionally model them.

Yet these exceptions do much to prove the rule: their insights were largely dismissed by their peers until the evidence was overwhelming. As for broader disagreements — such as the “saltwater-freshwater” divide on macroeconomic policy — they are tightly confined within admitted methodologies.

Geographic dominance matters too. When the route to influence even for non-US economists passes through top US departments, some opportunity for competing intellectual traditions is surely missed.

It is said that success has many parents, while failure has none. The opposite is the case for the economics profession: its shortcomings are what economists would call “causally overdetermined” — many factors could be to blame. A less concentrated economics could just mean more dispersed failure. Still, the principle that more pluralist systems are better and faster at self-correcting is worth holding on to, in business and knowledge production alike.

74725ed8cf,The Guardian,Thames Water urged to ‘get a grip’ on testing water supply after illness outbreak - The Guardian,"Steve Reed, Labour’s shadow environment secretary, has urged Thames Water to “get a grip” and test treatment works “urgently” after it emerged over the weekend that the company had tested the water at only one property.

Over the last two weeks, dozens of people in Beckenham, south-east London, have reported becoming unwell with diarrhoea and vomiting. The symptoms in most cases have lasted for an unusually long time – up to two weeks. They have also been severe, with multiple people hospitalised, including an eight-year-old boy.

Last Wednesday, Thames Water tested the water at the property of one person who had become unwell; the results came back clear. Since then others who are unwell in Beckenham have asked for a test. Thames initially said that since its initial tests came back clear, it did not need to conduct further tests. Thames has also not tested the wider supply or the treatment facilities specifically as a result of this suspected outbreak.

Syreeta Brown lives in Beckenham and her family has been unwell with diarrhoea and vomiting. She and her daughter experienced mild symptoms, but her eight-year-old son has been severely unwell for 12 days and was briefly hospitalised.

Thames Water rebuffed her requests to test her water. But after being contacted by the Guardian, Thames sent a technician to take samples from her tap on Monday.

“Thames Water’s response has felt very dismissive,” she said. “We’ve got two kids so of course we have dealt with diarrhoea and vomiting over the years but this was just not normal. We went to hospital after I went downstairs to discover he threw up, and was too weak to call for help. He was downstairs, he was lying in it and couldn’t call for help. Kids get bugs, this just felt different.”

She first tried calling the water company, but could not get through. She then used their WhatsApp service, through which operators told her not to worry and refused to test her tap water because they had already tested one property in the area.

She said: “When I had seen that they tested only one property, I thought why would you test just one property? It just seems a bit odd.”

Others who live in the area have said they have found it difficult to get a response from Thames Water when they have suffered from illness and asked for a test.

Reed said: “Thames Water must get a grip, be honest with the public and test treatment works in the area urgently.”

Speaking about the sewage scandal more broadly, Reed said that a Labour government would put the water companies under tough special measures. “We will give the regulator new powers so law-breaking water bosses face criminal charges and block their multimillion pound bonuses until they clean up their toxic filth.”

The Drinking Water Inspectorate has urged water companies to test thoroughly when asked to do so by customers, and told concerned people to contact them if their provider is not testing sufficiently.

A DWI spokesperson said: “Water companies are required to adhere to the water supply (water quality) regulations 2016. These regulations include statutory responsibilities for sampling drinking water, investigating concerns identified in the water supply system and reporting to the Drinking Water Inspectorate. This includes a requirement for water companies to investigate and take steps to determine if and why water quality is or is not meeting the specified requirements. If consumers are not satisfied with the response provided by their water company, they can contact the Drinking Water Inspectorate, who will investigate the company response as a complaint.”

The UK Health Security Agency confirmed it was monitoring connections between people complaining of illnesses locally, but that it had not so far found enough evidence to put out an alert.

Scientists said the reported symptoms sounded like cryptosporidium, or another waterborne disease, but that there could be other reasons for the symptoms.

Paul Hunter, a medicine professor from the University of East Anglia, said: “Cryptosporidium is the top, vomiting does occur but is not usually pronounced. You rarely see blood in the diarrhoea. There is a lot of crypto around at present. Giardia is another possibility, again watery diarrhoea no blood, but the characteristic feature is bloating and flatulence. They also tend to report abdominal pain. Salmonella infections can last quite some time as well. Stool can be watery or bloody, people may have a fever and may or may not report abdominal pain.”

Tim Walsh, professor of medical microbiology at the University of Oxford, added: “This will be food-/water-borne outbreak and is likely to have come from a common source. Should be easy to track down with decent retrospective epidemiology data and microbiology.”

This month, unsafe drinking water led to more than 100 cases of cryptosporidium in the Brixham area of Devon.

About 17,000 households and businesses were told by South West Water not to use their tap water for drinking without boiling and cooling it first after cryptosporidium was detected in the water supply.

A Thames Water spokesperson confirmed there has been no specific testing of the treatment centres or local works as a result of the concerns from customers, but added that more tap tests have been done. They are still waiting for some results.

They said: “We can confirm there are no water quality concerns in the central Sydenham water zone. We take all customer complaints of illness very seriously and have processes in place for investigating any contacts from customers.

“Our technicians have collected samples from a number of properties as part of our process. Initial on-site testing has not indicated any aesthetic [taste, smell, look] issue with the water. Samples were also collected for laboratory analysis and of the results we have received back, show no concerns.”","A hand is pouring water into a glass, with the logo of 'The Guardian' visible in the bottom right corner.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BA3032F20>,2024-05-29 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/29/thames-water-urged-to-test-supply-urgently-after-reported-illnesses,['Health' 'Local/Regional'],[0.9 0.9],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/74725ed8cf.png
162614fb2d,Forbes,"Where To Go In Vienna Now: New Hotels, Restaurants And Sights - Forbes","“Are you sure this is where you want to go?” asked the Uber driver, dropping me off at night in what looked like a construction project and, actually is: the Neues Landgut apartment/educational/green space urban district due to rise in Vienna’s 10th district by 2026. But without a large sign, the only way to find the new restaurant Steinhart within it is by following the blue dot on Google maps. It’s worth doing: this inventive restaurant is emblematic of the new energy in Vienna’s culinary scene and in the city itself.

The interior is industrial and spare, more Kreuzberg or Bushwick than the regal trappings in the imperial part of town. Within it, the menu is curated and inventive: white asparagus are at the height of the season at the moment but instead of serving them whole and sauced like they are in other places, they’re presented here as asparagus carbonara with asparagus tips mixed in with vinegary julienned asparagus atop fresh pasta in a densely flavored carbonara. Ravioli filled with roasted lamb arrives with wild broccoli and almonds; tender short ribs are accompanied by mashed potatoes with crunchy potato and bacon bits; ice cream comes in flavors such as Granny smith apple, white peach, sour cream and popcorn.

Another recently opened restaurant is at the opposite end of the elegance, location, presentation scale. Glasswing Restaurant, presided over by executive chef Alexandru Simon, serves an artistic, detailed, impeccably sourced seven course menu in a suave room of curved banquettes and grey walls lined with important Austrian art. Each course glides to the next with dishes such as Ora King Salmon with Cucumber and Makro-Algae and Sot L’y Laisse, fleshy knubs near the thigh known as chicken oysters with Morels and Pickled Kumquat but there are also a la carte choices such as the signature Norway Lobster with Cauliflower, Vadouvan Hollandaise and Caviar that shouldn’t be missed. Even breakfast, with dishes such as smoked fish with wasabi and beetroot and sweet and crunchy Kaiserschmarren (a chopped cross between pancakes and waffles) with apple puree and cinnamon is worth coming over for even if you’re not a guest of the hotel where it’s located.

That hotel is The Amauris Vienna, a Relais & Chateaux member, that opened in February of last year in a prime position around the corner from the Vienna State Opera on Kärntner Ring, a section of the Ring Road that encircles the 1st district or inner town. As befits that location, it’s a former noble residence from the 19th century now configured into 62 rooms and suites designed with sharp, contemporary Italian furnishings in jewel tones, fanciful light fixtures and five intricate types of marble, (160 tons worth which sounds ostentatious but actually isn’t), marquetry wood floors and more original art belonging to the owner. It also has a pool, spa and fitness room but one of the real pleasures of staying here is ascending in the turn of the 20th century, decorative cast iron elevator, a throwback to the house’s noble past when only the aristocrats could have such conveniences. (Those who use the modern elevator on the other side of the lobby to reach the upper floors are rewarded with a mural of humans trying to fly.)

Another newcomer to the hotel scene, if a more modest one with only 12 rooms and suites plus a two bedroom penthouse, is a few blocks away in a building with a history saturated with musical names: in its previous incarnation, the 19th century structure that opened as Hotel Zur Wiener Staatsoper in March housed luminaries such as Leonard Bernstein, Herbert von Karajan and Enrico Caruso. Mahler, Strauss, Mozart and Tchaikovsky all, reportedly, also spent time here, the reason several of the suites bear their names. Beethoven, in 1808, lived across the street. Now, with a serene, traditional design by the London designer Nina Campbell, and an extremely attentive staff, it feels like a private house. You don’t usually wave hello to the front office staff member when you return to a hotel but as you pass the open office door near the entrance, you do that here.

It’s a completely different feel over at The Hoxton Vienna which opened in April on the other side of the Ringstrasse and Stadtpark near Schloss Belvedere (and its most famous painting, Klimt’s The Kiss.) The building is midcentury modern, the tone: edgy as is its trademark and the rooftop bar Cayo Coco is Cuban with an array of tropical cocktails and a panoramic view over the city.

That view from a different perspective is also available from the terrace of &töchter, the café/bar in the Wien Museum which reopened in December after a four-year renovation and expansion; there’s also a new and popular modern Austrian restaurant trude on ground level with a terrace overlooking Karlsplatz park and the green domed, Baroque St. Charles’s Church. The interior of the museum displays the history of the city, artifacts from past eras, major paintings and sculpture, a major addition to the city’s dense museum lineup which also includes the Leopold Museum in the MuseumsQuartier for its sizeable collections of Klimt’s and Egon Schiele’s works and designer furnishings of early 20th century Viennese society. (There’s also another view over the city here by taking the external elevator to the roof. And for a lunch break: Glacis Beisl for well prepared Austrian classics in a garden setting adjacent to the museum.)

Apart from all of the news in town, there are always classics to revisit. The opulent, deep red Restaurant Rote Bar at The Sacher Hotel offers elevated versions of classic dishes such as the boiled beef Tafelspitz, new inventions such as a plant-based Wiener Schnitzel and a special white asparagus menu in season. (Instead of Sacher Torte, though; pick something else from the trolley or go around the corner for one of the cakes at Café Gerstner.) Coffeehouses are an essential part of the culture, are scattered all over town and everyone has favorites. If the line is too long at Café Central or Demel, Café Landtmann is a magnet for artists, intellectuals and politicians, was a former hangout for Mahler and Freud and has an excellent apple strudel adding to its appeal. Visitors in May will also get to experience the variety of Austria’s gourmet offerings when the annual GENUSS-FESTIVAL takes over the Stadtpark and showcases 100 producers ranging from the more typical hams, sausages, cheeses and breads to the more surprising caviar and escargots. And they give sample tastes.

Other places worth a visit: the Naschmarkt for its 100+ food stalls and restaurants (and on Saturdays, the extensive flea market in the parking lot next door); the idiosyncratic restaurant Skopik & Lohn in the 2nd district with a ceiling that makes you feel that you’re in a Jackson Pollock painting and a menu that might combine ceviche, sashimi and Schnitzel on any given night; the homey Vollpension decorated like a grandmother’s living room with cakes baked by grandmothers on site (complete with a granny baking school;) a performance at the Wiener Konzerthaus particularly during the Gemischter Satz festival in which guests sample wine before and in between performances in different concert halls that might include selections by Amy Winehouse, Schubert and Brahms.","A bustling street scene in Vienna with people dining at outdoor tables, a large white building with a green dome in the background, and shops with signs like 'Hessenberger' and 'JUWELEN-ANTI'.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BA218AF20>,2024-05-17 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.forbes.com,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lauriewerner/2024/05/17/new-hotels-restaurants-sights-where-to-go-in-vienna-now/,['Entertainment' 'Local/Regional'],[0.9 0.8],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/162614fb2d.png
eacfb5fddc,The Washington Post,‘In the name of God’: Native American children endured years of sexual abuse at boarding schools - The Washington Post,"These firsthand accounts and other evidence documented by The Washington Post reveal the brutality and sexual abuse inflicted upon children who were taken from their families under a systematic effort by the federal government to destroy Native American culture, assimilate children into White society and seize tribal lands.

From 1819 to 1969, tens of thousands of children were sent to more than 500 boarding schools across the country, the majority run or funded by the U.S. government. Children were stripped of their names, their long hair was cut, and they were beaten for speaking their languages, leaving deep emotional scars on Native American families and communities. By 1900, 1 out of 5 Native American school-age children attended a boarding school. At least 80 of the schools were operated by the Catholic Church or its religious affiliates.

The Post investigation reveals a portrait of pervasive sexual abuse endured by Native American children at Catholic-run schools in remote regions of the Midwest and Pacific Northwest, including Alaska.

At least 122 priests, sisters and brothers assigned to 22 boarding schools since the 1890s were later accused of sexually abusing Native American children under their care, The Post found. Most of the documented abuse occurred in the 1950s and 1960s and involved more than 1,000 children.

“A national crime scene” is how Deborah Parker, a citizen of the Tulalip Tribes and the chief executive of the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition, described the network of church-run Indian boarding schools.

“They committed crimes under the cloak,” said Parker, whose grandmother and other family members were sent to boarding schools. “They did it in the name of God.”

To investigate, The Post examined the work histories of priests named on lists, disclosed by Catholic entities, as having faced a “credible claim of sexual abuse.” Using those lists from dioceses and religious orders, The Post then identified which abusers worked at Indian boarding schools. Reporters also reviewed lawsuits, sworn affidavits, oral histories and thousands of boarding school records, and conducted interviews with former students.

The Post’s findings come at a time when the country’s first Native American Cabinet secretary, Deb Haaland — whose own relatives were sent to boarding schools — is scrutinizing the history of the schools that were operated or supported by the U.S. Interior Department, the agency she now leads.

As with past government inquiries into the boarding schools, Haaland’s investigation has not delved into the sexual abuse of Native American children at church-run schools. A 2022 report by her department blamed the U.S. government for the boarding school system and cited the “rampant physical, sexual, and emotional abuse” of the children. But the report did not detail the schools where sexual abuse happened, the number of children raped or molested, or the names of priests and other religious members who abused them.

“We care deeply about this issue, but it’s outside the scope of what we sought to do with the investigative reports,” said an Interior Department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to speak publicly. The official said the department did not seek records from the Catholic Church because its investigation was focused solely on the U.S. government’s role and reviewed only federal government documents.

Experts say The Post’s findings are a window into the widespread sexual abuse at Indian boarding schools. But the extent of the abuse was probably far worse, because the lists of accused priests are inconsistent and incomplete, and many survivors have not come forward. Others are aging and in poor health, or, like their abusers, have died.

The chances to document their testimonies are disappearing.

“I’ve been waiting 67 years to tell this story,” said Jim LaBelle, 77, an Iñupiaq from Fairbanks, Alaska, who spent six years at the Wrangell Institute, a government-run school in the state, 700 miles from his home. He was forbidden to use his Alaska Native name. From the time he was 8, he was instead identified by number, a new one assigned each year.

The abuse of Native American children predated by decades the revelations that priests at Catholic churches had sexually abused thousands of minors in the United States and other countries. Those scandals of the early 2000s gave Native Americans the courage to come forward with their own stories of abuse and seek accountability through lawsuits.

“It showed that people could stand up against a powerful entity like the church and that people could be held accountable,” said Vito de la Cruz, a Native American and Chicano lawyer who has represented boarding school survivors.

An attempt to sue the federal government failed, but some survivors of sexual abuse have successfully sued Catholic dioceses and religious orders and received settlements.

Unlike children abused by priests at churches in Boston and other big cities while they were living at home, Native American children were put into the care of alleged abusers at remote boarding schools, sometimes hundreds of miles from home.

Chart showing the appointments over time of priests credibly accused of sexual assault at 18 schools.

Eighteen of the 22 schools examined by The Post employed at least one credibly accused priest, sister or brother for 91 consecutive years. At these schools, successive generations of students continuously lived among predators.

“They can scream for help, but no one’s going to hear them or believe them. It’s a perpetrator’s wonderland,” said Patrick J. Wall, a former Catholic priest who once worked for the church as a self-described “fixer” settling child sexual abuse cases. He has since worked with lawyers representing Native American boarding school survivors.

The U.S. government’s efforts to address its legacy of boarding schools lag far behind those of Canada, where survivors were paid billions in compensation and a Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2015 declared the schools a form of “cultural genocide.”

Pope Francis traveled to Canada in 2022 to apologize for the church’s role in the “cultural destruction and forced assimilation promoted by the governments of that time.” But the pope has remained silent about the abuse at Catholic-run Indian boarding schools in the United States, which had received little scrutiny until the Interior Department’s report.

Cardinal Christophe Pierre, the Vatican’s ambassador to the United States, known as the apostolic nuncio, did not respond to an email or call for comment.

The church has addressed abuse by priests in U.S. parishes, but has said little about the molestation of children in Indian boarding schools. And although the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has grappled in recent years with the legacy of the church-run schools, it has not issued a formal apology.

Asked by The Post if the group was considering one, spokesperson Chieko Noguchi said it is “committed to fostering dialogue and engaging in other efforts to reconcile involvement in the boarding school period in the United States.”

“The Catholic Church recognizes and acknowledges that the history that is brought to light regarding the boarding school period of American history may cause deep sorrow in the Native and Indigenous communities, but we also prayerfully hope it may bring real and honest dialogue and lead towards a path of healing and reconciliation with the impacted communities,” Noguchi said.

The Rev. Mike Carson, assistant director for the subcommittee on Native American affairs with the bishops conference, addressed the church’s role in boarding schools last year in a webinar.

“Once abuse surfaced, the schools need[ed] to be closed and investigated. That did not happen for the most part,” Carson said. “Once the federal government required only English to be taught in the Catholic boarding schools, the answer should be no, because it violates our faith and should be a line that should not be crossed.”

Carson acknowledged the sexual and physical abuse of children in the Catholic-run schools and called for more scrutiny of what occurred, but also noted a likely dearth of records.

The Post reached out to Carson, who referred inquiries to the bishops conference.

The Interior Department’s report did not explore the role of the Catholic Church in the schools, except to say the U.S. government paid the church and other religious institutions to run many of the schools.

“I don’t look at it as we’re out to criticize the Catholic Church as much as bring this period of history into the consciousness of the American people,” Haaland told The Post in an interview. “It happened to Native Americans, but the history belongs to everyone who’s an American.”

Boarding school survivors have praised Haaland’s efforts, but say they still want apologies from the president and the pope.

Two years ago, the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), the oldest and largest organization of Native Americans and Alaska Natives, asked for an apology from the pope — and for the church to disclose internal records on abusers.

“The Catholic Church holds important records about Federal Indian boarding schools that can help bring the truth to light. We cannot hold abusers accountable, seek redress for harm, or reconcile with the Church, government institutions, and, in some cases, our own communities and families, until we know the full, unadulterated truth — truth the Catholic Church is actively withholding,” wrote Fawn Sharp, a citizen of the Quinault Nation and the NCAI’s president at the time.

In March, Parker, of the boarding school healing coalition, met at the White House with Tom Perez, a senior adviser and assistant to President Biden, and asked for a presidential apology for the widespread mistreatment and abuse that Native American children suffered at boarding schools.

The White House did not respond to requests for comment.

Advocates have not pushed for reparations from the U.S. government. Parker said doing so now is a “non-starter” because they first want Congress to create a truth and healing commission to uncover the horrors of the schools and the country’s assimilation policy.

“Unfortunately, many, many leaders in this country don’t even know what a U.S. Indian boarding school was,” Parker said. “And that’s the first step.”

Near the cliffs overlooking the Okanogan River, not far from a sprawling apple orchard in north-central Washington, the Catholic Church established St. Mary’s Mission School in 1886.

St. Mary’s, on the Colville Reservation, was created by federal policy that tasked people of “good moral character” with introducing Native American children to the “habits and arts of civilization” under the Civilization Fund Act of 1819. For Catholic missionaries and other religious groups, the schools were an opportunity to profit from contracts with the federal government and transform children the church saw as heathens into God-fearing disciples of Christianity.

Generations of children attended St. Mary’s before it was turned over to local tribes in 1973. Decades later, one former student’s stories of predatory behavior by a priest set off an avalanche of similar claims about priests at St. Mary’s — and at many other schools.

The account of Katherine Mendez, who was sent to the school in 1966, didn’t become public until 2007, when her nephew, Ken Bear Chief, a paralegal, told his boss that his Aunt Kathy had been molested as a child at St. Mary’s.

Blaine Tamaki, a trial lawyer in Washington state who knew little about Indian boarding schools, interviewed Mendez, then in her early 50s. Mendez, who was from the Cowlitz Indian Tribe, told him that shortly after she arrived at the school at age 11, one of the senior Jesuit priests — John J. Morse — began to prey upon her.

Mendez said Morse often ordered her to his office, sometimes to be disciplined. She said he insisted she sit on his lap, spanked her bare bottom and penetrated her with his fingers. He told her not to say a word about it if she ever wanted to go home again and see her mother, she said.

Mendez thought she was the only one. She wasn’t.

The abuse of children at St. Mary’s spanned more than two decades: Starting in 1948 and for 26 consecutive years, priests or brothers molested children at the school, according to The Post’s analysis. This was the longest uninterrupted stretch of abuse documented at any of the 22 schools. It is unclear whether church officials were aware of the abuse at St. Mary’s at the time.

Other survivors began to share their stories with Bear Chief — who was from the Nez Perce, Nooksack and Gros Ventre tribes — and the lawyers. One of those survivors was Clarita Vargas. She, too, had kept her secret about Morse for decades.

“The church wounded my spirit, took away my soul and robbed me of my childhood,” said Vargas, of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation in Washington. “It was the federal government that promoted the boarding school policy and the church was its arm. I blame them both.”

Vargas said Morse began to abuse her at St. Mary’s Mission in 1968. He told her that if she refused, she would not go to heaven. Sometimes, she said, Morse locked her in a rat-infested cellar.

Morse invited her and several girls to his office most Sunday nights, she said. He gave them hot cocoa, chocolate chip cookies or chocolate bars, and let them watch television. He would lean back in his recliner and place the girls one at a time on his lap, rubbing their backs until he ejaculated, Vargas said.

Tamaki and his lawyers heard repeatedly from other survivors about the “movie nights” that Morse hosted in his office. At Christmas, he gave the children candy canes. “They related the same exact story,” he said.

Some of the survivors said that as children they had tried to tell adults but were rebuffed or not believed. “It was almost like you were accusing God of abusing you if you reported it, because these priests were held up in such high esteem by everyone, second only to God,” said Bryan Smith, Tamaki’s law partner.

Tamaki’s investigation gathered evidence that Morse had molested 60 boys and girls, ages 5 to 15. The lawyers also identified about a dozen more priests at St. Mary’s who abused children from the 1940s into the 1970s.

The case grew to include about 500 former students at a dozen schools in remote Alaska villages and on Northwest tribal lands in Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana. The 500 survivors sued the Society of Jesus, Oregon Province, formerly known as the Northwest Jesuits.

“There was a pattern and practice at these schools that were basically unsupervised, isolated outposts,” Tamaki said.

The Northwest Jesuits initially denied the allegations. In a 2007 deposition, Morse denied sexually abusing children.

“You’re aware that women now say they feel they were sexually molested by you by sitting on your lap?” a lawyer asked Morse.

“Yeah, and that did not happen,” Morse replied. “There was no molesting while they were sitting there.” Morse died in Spokane in 2015 at age 85.

In February 2009, the Northwest Jesuits filed for bankruptcy. The legal move stopped depositions and some disclosure of church records about individual priests, and prevented a trial, a tactic experts said the church has used many times.

The Jesuits agreed to pay $166 million in 2011 to about 500 survivors as part of a bankruptcy settlement. It is the fourth-largest sexual abuse settlement by Catholic entities to date, according to Terence McKiernan, founder of BishopAccountability.org, a watchdog group that tracks sexual abuse by members of the Catholic Church. Survivors received on average $332,000 each, depending on the severity of abuse, said their lawyers.

As part of the settlement, the Jesuits agreed to make public a list of priests who had been accused of sexually assaulting children.

Two researchers, Jack Downey of the University of Rochester and Kathleen Holscher of the University of New Mexico, later used that list and other Jesuit lists to map the priests’ assignments. They found 47 priests accused of abuse who had been assigned to Catholic missions in Native American communities. The Post’s investigation, which reviewed their data and other records, identified the boarding schools where those priests worked and found 75 additional abusers.

The settlement also required the Jesuits to issue written apologies to the survivors.

“On behalf of the Oregon Province, I want to express our most sincere sorrow for the pain and hurt caused by the actions of a few men who did not live up to their vows,” the Very Rev. Patrick Lee, the senior official of the Oregon Province, wrote of the 64 credibly accused men on the list. “We will continue to pray for all those who are hurting and hope that today’s announcement brings all involved one-step closer to the lasting healing they so richly deserve.”

For many of the survivors, it wasn’t about the money. “It was the acknowledgment they were wronged,” said de la Cruz, the lawyer who represented many of the survivors and is Yaqui. “Finally somebody said, ‘Yes, you’re right. The things that you buried deep inside your psyche and your soul were more our fault.’”

After the settlement, Mendez spoke to reporters.

“When I came forward and saw that others did too, it was as if the blanket that had hidden our secret was pulled off and we could move into the light again,” she said. Mendez died last year.

Vargas now lives about 40 minutes from her old boarding school. For a long time, she blocked out the abuse. But she had difficulty trusting anyone and found it hard to build relationships. As an adult, she never wanted to eat chocolate because that is what the abusive priest used to give the children.

When Vargas eventually told her story to one of the lawyers, she said she felt embarrassed and guilty.

“I shouldn’t have felt ashamed by it, but I was,” Vargas told The Post.

The allegations of sexual abuse that started with Mendez in Omak led lawyers to discover long-hidden abuse at another school, St. Paul Mission and Boarding School, on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation, 40 miles from the Canadian border in Hays, Mont.

“It was a dumping ground for predatory priests,” said de la Cruz.

St. Paul, surrounded by grassy plains at the foot of the Little Rocky Mountains, was established in 1889 and was among the first schools funded by the federal government. Both the Jesuits and the Ursuline Sisters, a Catholic order of women, worked there. St. Paul was troubled from the early days, according to descendants of survivors and a collection of about 10,000 pages of letters, diaries, memos, government reports and oral histories reviewed by The Post. Conditions at the overcrowded school were deplorable: poor plumbing, little heat, and horsemeat for food. Abuse was rampant.

The stories of the abuse that children endured at St. Paul and other schools were often passed down orally in Native American families.

George Chandler, a Gros Ventre man born in 1922, said in an oral history about his time as a student at St. Paul that “they would stuff flashlight batteries” in the children’s mouths to punish them. “They would jam it there and hit them like that and make their mouth bleed,” Chandler recounted. “If you cried, they would hit you all the harder. If one didn’t hurt you enough, they would stuff two in there.”

Warren Morin, 60, a member of the Gros Ventre tribe, told The Post that his grandfather told him harrowing stories about St. Paul and said he and the other boys and girls there “lived in hell.” But Morin said his grandfather never said anything to him about sexual abuse.

“If something like that happened to them, they’d take it to the grave,” Morin said.

Survivors of sexual abuse at St. Paul began to share their painful stories as lawyers came to their reservation to investigate.

One of the survivors, the 70-year-old man named Jay, recounted in an interview with The Post how two priests, a brother and a sister sexually abused him at St. Paul. He was 6 when the abuse began in 1959, and it continued until he was 12.

Jay said Sister Sigfrieda Hettinger would tell him to stand before a statue of the Virgin Mary. She would order him to take down his pants and then would perform oral sex. He said she repeated the act with other children.

“We were little kids,” said Jay, a tall, slender man with closely cropped dark hair who still finds it hard to talk about what happened to him so many years ago.

“We didn’t know what to think,” he said. “She would touch us all over and put our face to her breasts. Before she would do these things, she’d make a sign of the cross.”

Hettinger, who worked at St. Paul from 1958 to 1966, denied in a 2015 deposition that she or anyone else at the school sexually abused children.

“I loved them all,” Hettinger said. “I never hurt them at all. I never touched them at all.”

“During the entire period of time, did you ever observe any child being sexually abused by anyone?” a lawyer asked her.

“No, no,” she said.

She died the next year at age 87 in Milwaukee.

At least 19 priests, brothers and sisters were accused of sexually abusing 21 Native American children at St. Paul, primarily in the 1950s and 1960s, according to The Post’s analysis and court records.

One of the Jesuit priests who were accused of preying on children at St. Paul was the Rev. Edmund J. Robinson. From the 1950s through the early 1980s, church officials had moved him from boarding school to boarding school, according to church and court records, lawsuits and an article in the Great Falls Tribune.

That was the church’s pattern for many predatory priests, according to former church insiders and attorneys for the survivors. “It was remove, hide, shuffle,” said one of those lawyers, Dan Fasy.

Robinson, known as “Father Eddy,” started his career in the mid-1950s at St. Paul. Shortly after he arrived, he allegedly sexually abused a child. He then went to a Jesuit priests’ training college but returned to St. Paul, where he was later accused of sexually assaulting two more children. He was then moved to another boarding school, St. Ignatius Mission — 400 miles away in Montana — where he allegedly sexually abused a 5-year-old.

Robinson had been replaced at St. Paul by the Rev. Arnold Custer — who was also later accused of sexually abusing a child, according to court documents, local media reports, and watchdog groups that monitor predatory priests. Custer has since died.

In 1984, letters between church authorities showed that Robinson was being treated at the Servants of the Paraclete in Jemez Springs, N.M., a facility for troubled priests, according to church and court records.

In New Mexico, Robinson said that he realized “something was wrong within him and that he must do something about it,” according to a November 1984 mental health evaluation obtained by The Post. One of the men involved in Robinson’s “spiritual direction” at Servants of the Paraclete was later accused of sexually abusing multiple children, records show. The center discharged Robinson the next year and he served at several other Catholic parishes until the early 1990s.

During his time as a priest, Robinson was accused of sexually abusing nine boys and girls at several boarding schools, records show. Robinson spent more than two decades working at Indian boarding schools, and served at St. Paul Mission on three separate occasions.

In 2018, the Jesuits West Province included Robinson’s name on a publicly released list of credibly accused priests.

Robinson had died in 2014 after spending the last years of his life at the Regis Community in Spokane, Wash. — like other Jesuits accused of sexually assaulting minors, according to the Jesuits West list of credibly accused priests, court documents, interviews with lawyers and local media reports.

In 2021, the Jesuit Conference released a statement about Indian boarding schools, saying, “We regret our participation in the separation of families and the suppression of Native languages, cultures and sacred ways of life.” Two years later, Jesuits West launched a website to address the role of the Jesuits in operating Indian boarding schools.

One by one, starting in the 1950s, Geraldine Charbonneau Dubourt and her eight sisters from the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa were sent more than 400 miles away from their North Dakota home to St. Paul’s Indian Mission School in Marty, S.D., on the Yankton Sioux Reservation.

Dubourt, who attended St. Paul’s from 1955 to 1967, said that starting when she was 6, a priest fondled her on the playground, according to an affidavit. When she was a teenager, a different priest repeatedly raped her, she said. One of Dubourt’s sisters said that when she was 9, she was raped by a priest on a kitchen table. A third sister said that a priest “would take me down to the basement and have me perform oral sex on him.” He also showed her an area where coffins were stored. “One time he put me inside a coffin and I thought I would die,” she said in an affidavit.

In 2008, the nine siblings sued 12 priests, sisters and school workers over alleged abuse, in a case that became known as “The Nine Little Girls” and was covered by the Indian Country press, including by Native News Online. They also sued the Catholic Diocese of Sioux Falls and three religious groups.

The Sioux Falls Diocese and the religious organizations denied wrongdoing and said they had no responsibility for the priests, sisters and school employees, who have all since died. The diocese did not respond to a request for comment.

In 2010, shortly before the case was set to go to trial, the South Dakota legislature passed a law that prohibits victims of alleged sexual abuse who are 40 or older from suing institutions.

While many states have extended deadlines for filing sexual abuse lawsuits, South Dakota — which had 35 Indian boarding schools — is one state that took action to make it nearly impossible for aging survivors to seek justice, according to Marci A. Hamilton, an expert on child sex abuse statutes of limitation and the founder and CEO of Child USA, a nonprofit group working to end child abuse.

“What’s unbelievable is that since 2002, we’ve had 293 laws passed in the United States that extend the statute of limitations” for sexual abuse victims, Hamilton said. But “this law rolls it back rather than making it more generous.”

Steve Smith, a South Dakota lawyer who represented a Catholic congregation that ran an Indian boarding school in the state, wrote the legislation that changed the statute of limitations. The boarding school that his client ran had faced numerous lawsuits filed by former students who said they were sexually abused there. Protecting the congregation from further litigation was a motivating factor, Smith told The Post.

A series of court rulings eventually led to the dismissal of the suit brought by the Charbonneau sisters, along with lawsuits by more than 100 other survivors.

“The passage of the legislation was the catalyst for the sisters’ case and numerous other cases being shut down statewide,” said Gregory A. Yates, the lawyer who represented the South Dakota survivors. “The effect was to revictimize these survivors of childhood sexual abuse.”

Smith said in an interview that he “absolutely” believes that the nine sisters were molested at St. Paul’s.

“There is no doubt in my mind in just listening to them that they are sincere in their story,” Smith said. But he said that individual abusers should be held responsible — not churches or religious institutions.

Dubourt, with long gray hair, is now in poor health. She is still passionate about wanting accountability from the church and the state for what happened to her as a child. For nearly a decade, she and her sisters dressed in long Native American ribbon skirts and protested at the South Dakota Capitol, in Pierre, to try to get the law changed.

“If we die, we’ll go away,” Dubourt told The Post. “Other than that, we are not going away.” Three of her sisters have died.

Dubourt said she and her sisters still carry the abuse they suffered as children at St. Paul’s Indian Mission School.

“You just set it on the back burner for a minute so you can survive,” she said.

South Dakota’s law would have prevented the aging survivors of sexual abuse at another school, St. Francis Indian Mission School, from suing the church. But lawyers found “smoking gun” letters in church files that showed that church officials had “covered up” evidence of abuse, Yates said. The letters allowed the lawyers to successfully argue under a different statute that a Catholic order had fraudulently concealed evidence of sexual abuse, he said.

The lawyers discovered the letters in 2011 after two women who had attended St. Francis, on the Rosebud Reservation, said they were abused, Yates said. The letters revealed that priests knew that a colleague, Brother Francis Chapman, known as “Chappy,” was molesting children.

“Chappy had his problems — drinking to excess, fooling around with little girls — he had them down the basement of our building in the dark, where we found a pair of panties torn,” a priest named Richard T. Jones wrote to a fellow cleric in 1968.

Jones, who has since died, wrote that a person working at the mission didn’t want Chapman around children, but made no mention of action being taken.

Three years later, the Rev. Bernard D. Fagan, a superior at the St. Francis school, wrote to a church official that Chapman was involved in another incident “similar to those of the past.” Fagan said they decided to “counsel with him rather strongly in the hope that future incidents would be avoided.”

Fagan himself later admitted in a 1994 letter to a Diocese of Rapid City official that he sexually abused 12 Native American girls.

In 2015, the two former St. Francis students who sued received confidential settlements for abuse they suffered from Chapman, Yates said.

Both Chapman and Fagan have since died. In 2019, both were identified by the Rapid City Diocese as priests credibly accused of sexual abuse of a minor.

“Let us all pray for reparation for the sins and failings of those who abused their power and authority which led to the injury of others, especially our children,” the Most Rev. Robert D. Gruss, then the bishop of Rapid City, wrote in disclosing their names.

Chapman was one of 10 alleged abusers at the school, The Post’s analysis shows. Starting in 1942 with his employment and for the next 61 years, the school continuously employed at least one priest or brother accused of sexually assaulting or raping children.

On a recent afternoon at the Interior Department’s headquarters, Secretary Haaland pointed to framed photos of her parents and grandparents in her office, which is decorated with Native American paintings, pottery and blankets.

Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna tribe of New Mexico and a Catholic, said that when her grandmother was little, she and other children were rounded up by a priest in their village and put on a train to a boarding school in Santa Fe, about 100 miles from her home. Her great-grandfather was sent more than 1,000 miles to one of the nation’s first federal boarding schools, in Carlisle, Pa., where the founder’s philosophy was: “Kill the Indian in him, and save the man.”

“They were stolen,” she said.

When Haaland was still a member of Congress in 2020, she introduced legislation to create the first commission in U.S. history to investigate and document America’s Indian boarding schools.

The legislation was reintroduced last year in the Senate and this year in the House — but has not reached the floor for a vote in either chamber. The commission would have subpoena power, which could be used to compel the Catholic Church and other religious institutions that ran the schools to disclose their internal documents about boarding schools, experts said.

The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has not taken a position on the legislation, said Noguchi, the group’s spokesperson.

After the 2021 discovery of 215 suspected unmarked graves at the former Kamloops Indian Residential School in Canada, Haaland, by this time Biden’s interior secretary, launched her investigation into U.S. Indian boarding schools.

Canada was a role model for such an effort, advocates said.

The Canadian government had created a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and the prime minister issued a formal apology in 2008 after settling a massive class-action suit brought by school survivors. Seven years later, the commission reported that about half of the 78,748 survivors who filed claims said they were sexually or seriously physically abused. Nearly half of the 146 schools were run by Catholic organizations, according to the National Center for Truth and Reconciliation in Canada.

But the U.S. government inquiry isn’t as far-reaching as that of Canada, which spent about $6 billion Canadian on its boarding school investigation, including compensation to survivors. The U.S. Congress has appropriated $21 million over the last three years for the Interior Department’s ongoing inquiry.

During that time, Haaland’s team has been sifting through tens of millions of pages of U.S. government records to piece together the history of boarding schools for a series of reports. The records, many on fragile onion skin paper, include attendance reports, contracts and correspondence. Documents are scattered across the country at the National Archives, universities, tribal offices and local historical societies. Nearly 100 feet underground in limestone caves in Lenexa, Kan., thousands of boxes of additional records on Native Americans and their education are stored in a temperature-controlled federal repository.

A 1928 investigation commissioned by the federal government called the Meriam Report chastised the schools for the mistreatment and malnourishment of students. A 1969 congressional inquiry condemned the schools for trying to destroy Native American culture, laying the groundwork for ending the government’s assimilation policy in the boarding school system. But neither investigation mentioned sexual abuse, and archived documents from the 1969 report contain no evidence that the matter was ever examined.

The Interior Department’s 2022 report, written by Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs Bryan Newland, a citizen of the Bay Mills Indian Community (Ojibwe), said Native American boys experienced more physical and sexual abuse in the schools than girls. But it does not go further, and Interior officials said the abuse was rarely — if ever — recorded in government files.

“I doubt that you could find a lot of Catholic records or federal government records about abuse and neglect toward the students,” Haaland said.

Interior’s report, instead, focused on the history of the boarding school era and how it targeted Native American, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian children. It was the first government effort to count the schools and list their locations. The report also revealed that at least 500 boys and girls died at the schools — and that the number could “be in the thousands or tens of thousands.” Many were buried in unmarked graves at schools, the report said.

As part of her effort, Haaland traveled to 12 places across the country, from Oklahoma to Alaska, on what she called “The Road to Healing” tour. For up to eight hours a day, she listened to stories of physical and sexual abuse told by survivors and their descendants. Survivor stories are being compiled by the healing coalition and the Interior Department into an oral history project that may be displayed by the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.

For many, Haaland’s listening sessions were the first chance to confront the government and say out loud what happened to them.

One afternoon in April 2023, hundreds of survivors packed into a cavernous hall supported by giant cedar columns on the Tulalip Tribes’ reservation in Washington state. After an opening ceremony of Native American drumming and singing, Haaland and Newland took their seats at the front. One by one, elderly boarding school survivors stood to tell their stories.

Nancy Shippentower of the Puyallup Tribe said her husband had been sexually abused at a boarding school in Oregon when he was little. “He said that he was an altar boy and he was raped by the priests,” she said. “He was sexually abused by the nuns. And his hands were beat black and blue.”

When Matthew War Bonnet, 78, of the Sicangu Lakota tribe, stood up and began to speak, a hush fell over the room.

At age 6, War Bonnet had been sent to the St. Francis Indian Mission School in Rosebud, S.D. War Bonnet said he and other children were beaten so badly that they were often sent to the infirmary for treatment.

War Bonnet held up replicas of a rope and a strap used to lash children as punishment. The rope was four strands tied together. They called it the “Jesus rope,” War Bonnet said.

The strap carried strands of razor-sharp metal strips.

“This strap taught me not to feel,” said War Bonnet, his voice cracking.

A year later, in her Washington office, Haaland singled out his testimony among the hundreds of accounts she had heard. Tears filled her eyes.

“It’s a terrible, horrific, devastating history,” Haaland said. “You name the worst thing that you could imagine happening to people and it happened to Indigenous people right here in this country.”","An image of a person standing in a church with a cross and a statue of Jesus, with a closed door in the background.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x150 at 0x7D6B7E243790>,2024-05-29 10:35:00+00:00,https://www.washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2024/sexual-abuse-native-american-boarding-schools/,['Politics' 'National'],[0.9 0.8],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/eacfb5fddc.png
273aaed957,Newsmax,Napolitano to Newsmax: Trump's NY Jurors Don't Have to Agree on Crime Committed - Newsmax,"Retired New Jersey Superior Court Judge Andrew Napolitano told Newsmax on Tuesday that the jurors in former President Donald Trump's New York paperwork trial don't all have to agree on a crime in order to convict him.

""Here's the crazy thing about this statute: You could have half the jury believing the underlying crime was an illegal campaign contribution and half the jury believing the underlying crime was a reduction of the adjusted gross income of The Trump Organization, thereby reducing their tax liability, thereby defrauding the State of New York of the fair market value of the tax on $130,000,"" Napolitano said during an appearance on ""National Report.""

""Under the law, they're all supposed to agree,"" he said. ""They're all supposed to be of one mind on every element of the crime. But this is a crazy case, where, apparently — again, this hasn't been tried before — they don't have to agree as to which crime it is, as long as 12 of them agree that a crime was hidden or masked by the manner in which Stormy Daniels was paid and Michael Cohen was reimbursed.""

Jurors in Trump's paperwork trial are back in court Tuesday after an eight-day break from the case and are expected to hear closing arguments from both the former president's legal team and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office before being charged by Judge Juan Merchan with an explanation of the law.

""What is the underlying federal law that he [Trump] is alleged to have broken?"" Napolitano said. ""Well, it's about time for Judge Merchan to tell the jury what that underlying law is that the president is alleged to have broken and to tell them that there must be evidence of proof beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty that, in fact, he broke that federal law. We'll find that out when the judge gives his explanation of the law at the end of the day today or tomorrow morning.""

The retired New Jersey judge also offered a ""rule of thumb"" to watch for when it comes to the jury reaching a verdict.

""If a verdict comes in in an hour or so, it's a not guilty,"" he said. ""On the other hand, it could also be a not guilty if it comes in two days. Sometimes jurors will take a vote and be surprised. 'It's the first time we're talking about this. I can't believe we all believe he's not guilty. Maybe we shouldn't go out there right now. They'll think we didn't look at the evidence carefully. Let's wait an hour or so and then we'll go out.'""

""Other times, there may be a split amongst the jurors, and then they must begin methodically to go through all the evidence,"" he continued. ""So, a very quick verdict almost always means not guilty, but a verdict that takes a long time could also mean not guilty. Conviction will take a while because they will have to decide do we believe Michael Cohen? Is the other evidence — the documents from The Trump Organization — is that strong enough to convict, even though we wouldn't trust Michael Cohen with the time of day? All of these things they're going to have to go through and it takes time.""

944d1c5eb6,The Guardian,Keir Starmer: ‘no quick fix to Tory mess’ if Labour wins election - The Guardian,"There will be no “quick fix” to the deep problems Labour will inherit if it wins the next election, Keir Starmer has said while unveiling his party’s six election pledges amid a fanfare of endorsements from senior public figures.

The Labour leader said “most reasonable, tolerant people” in the country wanted what his party wanted for Britain, before he received an extraordinary endorsement from the Boots chief executive, Sebastian James, an Old Etonian who was a member of the private all-male Bullingdon Club alongside David Cameron.

James, who is pictured in the infamous club photograph (see below) alongside Cameron and Boris Johnson, appeared in a video message endorsing Rachel Reeves’ plans for economic stability.

The Labour leader told the launch event in Essex, attended by the entire shadow cabinet: “There is no quick fix to the mess that the Tories have made of this country.”

He said the public could expect to see his six pledges materialise within two terms of a Labour government, noting “we won’t be forgiven if we’re not prepared on day one if we are privileged enough to come in to serve”.

Starmer rejected suggestions the pledges were unambitious, saying that restoring stability must be the party’s first step before it embarks on any more ambitious plans to change the nation. “This is a very different moment to 1997, after the damage that’s been done in the last 14 years,” he said.

Starmer said he had recently spoken to a couple in Wolverhampton who had decided they could not afford to have a second child.

“I’m not prepared to let an incoming Labour government ever do that kind of damage to working people,” he told the audience. “That’s why I can hardly believe I’m saying this: stability is change, and that’s why it has to be our first step.”

The party has distributed a physical and digital pledge card with key promises, such as stabilising the economy, cutting NHS waiting times, setting up Great British Energy, cracking down on antisocial behaviour and recruiting 6,500 new teachers, which are the latest steps in his “national missions”.

Starmer addressed an audience packed with longstanding Labour figures and prospective parliamentary candidates in a grand room at the Backstage Centre film studios in Purfleet-on-Thames.

Before his speech, shadow cabinet ministers Reeves, Wes Streeting, Ed Miliband, Yvette Cooper and Bridget Phillipson took turns to expand on the personal challenges people are facing across the country in relation to their briefs, which they said was driving their ambition for change.

Rayner, the deputy leader, kicked off the event, saying the party had “no illusions about the scale of the climb ahead”. “We aren’t promising the world,” she said, “but we are promising what we are confident that we can deliver on.”

Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said Labour was “ready to serve, ready to lead and ready to rebuild Britain”, but suggested the work of returning to economic stability could take two terms of a Labour government, and would “require tough choices. It will take hard work. A decade of national renewal.”

James’s endorsement was designed to demonstrate the breadth of support the party was receiving. Nodding to Labour’s five-point plan to save Britain’s high streets he said a “thriving high street helps to build communities and will be a really important gamechanger in the next few years”.

Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said Labour would provide the NHS with 40,000 more appointments each week, at evenings and weekends. “Healthcare for the many, paid for by the few, investing more in the NHS and reforming the way the service works,” he said.

Streeting introduced Nathaniel Dye, who has terminal cancer and waited more than 100 days for treatment when the government’s target is about 62 days. Dye said he hoped to see a Labour government so other people “can avoid ending up like me”.

Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said she would make Labour “a government of law and order, putting the safety of communities right at its very heart”, citing plans for 13,000 more neighbourhood police officers and police community support officers, 100 new youth hubs and stronger laws to tackle violence against women and girls.

Miliband, the shadow secretary for energy security and net zero, relayed a core argument the party is likely to lean on in the election: people will face higher bills and energy insecurity with the Tories. Internal Labour polling has found more than 60% of Tory voters back the party’s ambition of setting up Great British Energy.

Responding to a question from the Guardian, Starmer stressed housing and workers’ rights were “integral” to his six steps, and the fact that there were only a limited number of steps did not mean other issues would be “put to one side”.

Labour paraded a number of endorsements including one from Neil Basu, a former assistant commissioner at the Metropolitan police.

Starmer was introduced by Haruna Hamza, a Thurrock resident who said he was switching his vote from the Conservatives to Labour because the Tories had “let the country down”.

The event has kicked off the party’s biggest advertising campaign since 2019. Billboards and vans will be seen in key battleground seats in London, Rochester, Stoke-on-Trent and Darlington and there will be a number of regional newspaper adverts. The shadow cabinet will also take Labour’s message to the country on a number of visits in areas such as Wolverhampton, Leigh, Aldershot, Doncaster and Bassetlaw.","A man stands on a stage with a microphone, wearing a white shirt, with the 'The Guardian' logo in the bottom right corner.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BA22EE1D0>,2024-05-16 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/may/16/keir-starmer-says-stability-first-step-to-making-britain-better,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/944d1c5eb6.png
6214ea3db7,The Washington Post,Ship that collapsed Baltimore bridge to be removed Monday - The Washington Post,"The Dali, the huge container ship that collapsed Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge in March, closing Baltimore Harbor, will be refloated and moved Monday, a significant milestone in the cleanup of the wreckage, authorities said.

The unified command in charge of operations at the site of the collapse said officials hope to move the vessel at high tide Monday morning to a marine terminal about 2½ miles from where it struck a bridge pier, causing the collapse.

Refloating and removing the Dali appears to be one of the last and largest steps in the eight-week effort to reopen the harbor and its shipping channel after the collapse on March 26.

Initially, people had said the removal of the Dali and the reopening of the main shipping channel “could take six and nine months,” Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” But, he added, “I’m proud that ...by the end of May we’ll have that federal channel reopened.”

Asked about Republicans who didn’t support allocating federal funding to rebuild the bridge, Moore said it was imperative to keep the project on time and on budget but assured critics that “the American people will be made whole.”

The collapse, with the Dali resting in the shipping channel afterward, has severely affected the Port of Baltimore and the economy that depends on it.

Six people who were working on the bridge when it collapsed died in the disaster. The bodies of all six have been recovered from the Patapsco River as of earlier this month, when the remains of one of the construction workers were recovered.

In a key recent step that made it possible to refloat the Dali, controlled explosions were used to remove a large part of the bridge truss from the bow of the vessel.

Noting that the time of the refloat and the movement of the ship remain subject to change, officials said that as many as five tugboats will escort the Dali to the Seagirt Marine Terminal.

An 18-hour sequence of steps leading to the refloat of the Dali began Sunday, officials said.

Among steps listed were:

Releasing some anchors and mooring lines that have been attached to the ship.

Discharging some or all of the 1.25 million gallons of water pumped aboard the ship to make up for the weight removed by the demolition.

Inspection to ensure that obstructions have been removed from the left side of the vessel.

Unified command officials have said they evaluated sonar imagery but were also relying on the results of a dive survey before proceeding with plans to refloat and move the Dali.

Officials asserted that emphasis will be placed on safety. The tugs are to push or pull the Dali at a speed of about 1 mile an hour. That is slower than the average walking pace.

Before the controlled demolition of the bridge wreckage, nearly half of the harbor’s main channel had been cleared to a depth of 48 feet, officials said.

They said they expected that in the coming week, the channel would be available to a depth of 50 feet to all commercial vessels going in and out of the Port of Baltimore.

Maryland officials estimate that rebuilding the bridge, which opened in 1977, will cost between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion.

The new bridge will be designed according to modern safety standards intended to prevent it from collapse if a single component fails, officials have said.",A large ship with a collapsed bridge in the background is being removed from the water.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6B7DBFB6D0>,2024-05-18 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/05/18/dali-baltimore-key-bridge/,['Local/Regional' 'Politics'],[0.85 0.65],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/6214ea3db7.png

“Men like Donald Trump are not at the moment in charge … but there is a trend toward the more neo-right, even fascist tradition, which is frightening,” Coppola said. “Because anyone who was alive during World War II saw the harm that took place and we don’t want a repeat of that.”

He’s called Trump “the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln.” He’s also come out in favor of Israel defending itself in the war in Gaza and has endorsed Trump’s presidential candidacy in 2024.

He did not, however, take Coppola’s bait. The film, he said, was about how we can make the world better, and he’d been deeply moved by it, as someone who’d first heard Coppola talk about it 25 years ago, back when Voight was a central figure of the American counterculture — which he’s since repudiated. “I agree with this film, Francis’s vision that says human beings are capable of solving every problem we get ourselves into … we must bond together, we must help each other, we must listen to each other and we must take this on,” Voight said.

Unlike many directors here trying to sell a film, Coppola hadn’t given a single interview about “Megalopolis,” despite the fact that he’s yet to find an American distributor and had to sell part of his successful winery to come up with the funds to make it. This news conference was journalists’ first opportunity to pepper Coppola with questions of why and how he had made such a head scratcher. (At an earlier screening, the audience gasped and burst out giggling, for instance, when Voight’s billionaire character, on his deathbed, pretends to have an erection and instead produces a tiny bow and arrow, perfectly suited for a vengeful rampage.)

The film has MAGA parallels, sure, but it’s also Coppola’s way of comparing the downfall of American society to the fall of Rome — under the framework of something like a Greek tragedy or Shakespearean play, replete with incest, star-crossed lovers and two warring houses, with Driver’s and Esposito’s characters essentially representing the allures of art and science, and LaBeouf as someone who’s preying off those disillusioned by both.

Why did Coppola want to do “a Roman epic, but set in modern America”? “Because America was founded on the ideas of the Roman Republic,” he said, explaining that much of our architecture is based on Rome, including the original Penn Station, modeled on the Baths of Caracalla.

“I had no idea that the politics of today would make that so relevant, because what’s happening in America, in our republic, in our democracy, is exactly how Rome lost their republic thousands of years ago,” Coppola said. It wasn’t politicians who’d be the answer, he added, but artists who would illuminate what’s happening, “and allow people to see it, because you can’t act on it if you can’t see it.”

Coppola dismissed concerns that he’d squandered his personal fortune on this project. His children had careers and would be fine, he said. “Money doesn’t matter,” he said, providing a life lesson to the room. “What matters are friends.”

And he seemed quite comfortable about his lack of U.S. distribution. He could wait. He didn’t want to send it to streaming, “which is what we used to call home video,” he said, mentioning the dominance of companies like Apple and Amazon. He wanted an audience to see it together and become one. “I fear that the film industry has become more a matter of people being hired to meet their debt obligations,” he said, “because studios face great debt and their job is not to make good movies. Their job is to make sure that they pay their debt obligations.”

And he also put to rest the idea that “Megalopolis” is a coda to his career. “I’ll be here in 20 years, I think,” he said, mentioning that he’d already started writing another film.

At 85, criticism has long ceased to matter to him. “So many people when they die say, ‘Oh, I wish I’d done that,” he said. “When I die, I’m going to say, ‘I got to see my daughter win an Oscar and I got to make wine and I got to make every movie I wanted to make.’ And I’m gonna be so busy thinking of all the things that I got to do that when I die I won’t notice it.”","A group of people posing for a photo with a podium in front of them, with a crowd of photographers in the background.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6B7EC8C550>,2024-05-17 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/movies/2024/05/17/megalopolis-about-francis-ford-coppola-cannes/,['Politics' 'Entertainment'],[0.85 0.65],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/397c907309.png
b428e31e5e,Forbes,The House Bans The Fed From Building A CBDC Like The Digital Yuan - Forbes,"The House of Representatives has made a significant move by banning the Federal Reserve from creating the ""digital dollar,"" a central bank digital currency. This decision, proposed by the House Majority Whip, Rep. Tom Emmer, as the ""CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act,"" is a crucial amendment to the Federal Reserve Act, which governs the US central banking system. The amendment states, ""The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee may not use any central bank digital currency to implement monetary policy.""

The vote on the ban was almost a party-line vote, with three Democrats joining all Republicans in voting yes. However, the Bill still has a long way to go before becoming law - it needs to pass a vote in the Senate and potentially stand a presidential veto. The fact that Ex-President Trump has repeatedly mentioned that he would not allow a ""digital dollar"" to be built and the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, had also said that the Federal Reserve would not start implementing a digital dollar without congressional approval, adds to the potential implications of this ban passing the House. The Senate likely has allies on a CBDC ban, though whether there is a majority and/or a veto-proof majority would be an open question.

Still, as one of the chief opponents of the Bill, Rep. Maxine Waters, put it, ""In fact, if this bill becomes law, we would be the only country in the world to ban a CBDC."" Prohibiting ""innovation"" on the central bank digital currency front seems like a policy miss at first sight. However, as I detail in my book on Bitcoin + China, the Chinese party-state hasn't gotten that far with its CBDC, the e-CNY, or ""digital Yuan."" Adoption is lagging, and people prefer private options like WeChat Pay and Alipay - though the state has put a lot of muscle into it with pilot programs that offer essentially free money and ample state media support. Even though it's banned, people still use and sell Tether and Bitcoin, and people go to jail for selling Tether. China wants to expand the central bank digital currency model and has already piloted it in the M-Bridge with other central banks and in Hong Kong, but adoption has been lagging for now.

Part of this is that central bank digital currencies do two things that put central banks off-guard: they put central banks, which are used to be banking regulators, in the hot seat when it comes to technology choices and, by definition, only provide closed-source vendors chosen by the central bank - and not open source builds or game-theory proven approaches to mitigate attacks. The Chinese party-state has been the victim of cyberattacks before and is taking an approach potentially vulnerable to more.

Central banks are used to governing by edict, not by product metrics. In China, this has led to Alipay and WeChat Pay maintaining their advantages through sheer user engagement/retention - their app ecosystems and services providing more than enough staying power. And if there were transaction throughput (the e-CNY has done a fraction of what Bitcoin does, though it's hard to verify/audit figures as there are few public ones), the central bank would have to deal with ledgers with millions of transactions rather than the engineering and data teams that usually do.

Secondly, in the face of these new technological choices, central banks struggle to understand the privacy tradeoffs that their users demand. While offering ""privacy"" at face value, the privacy that entails giving every financial detail up to trust alone hasn't been very popular, even in countries that transact in a largely cashless fashion like China.

Still, that doesn't mean there shouldn't be concern. After all, a central bank digital currency implemented as an international standard would offer unparalleled surveillance and individualized control. That governments have yet to succeed with forced innovation standards top-down doesn't mean they won't try to push harder with force - and might win through sheer gravity. And even if this bill becomes law, there are many ways around it, from working with banks in the system to issue stablecoins, to the ECASH Act that proposes the Treasury issue digital money instead.

It's easy to see how dystopian that situation is when you think of a Chinese party-state that imprisons people for tweets seen by a few dozen people at best and which meets banking protests because of a loss of funds by deploying COVID codes as a weapon to keep protestors at home. What about closer to home, though?

By taking this step, House legislators have decided not to pursue China’s path when it comes to central bank digital currencies, digital freedom and financial surveillance. Even if it might be symbolic - it is an important symbol to know where the United States stands.","An older man with grey hair and glasses, adjusting his glasses, with a blurred face, wearing a dark suit and a white shirt, in a formal setting.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BA21886D0>,2024-05-23 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.forbes.com,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/05/23/the-house-bans-the-fed-from-building-a-cbdc-like-the-digital-yuan/,['Politics' 'Business and Finance' 'International'],[0.95 0.9  0.8 ],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/b428e31e5e.png
8d62c49ab4,ABC News,‘We will celebrate your life’: Family of missing trans woman calls attention to her disappearance on her birthday - ABC News,"Family and friends of Taylor Casey, a Chicago woman who has been missing in the Bahamas since June 20, held a press conference Thursday in front of Federal Plaza in Chicago, marking Casey’s 42nd birthday and calling further attention to her disappearance.

Casey’s mother, Colette Seymore, read a letter to her daughter at the press conference.

“Taylor, today is your birthday. And we all just want to say happy birthday. Although it's not so happy because you are not here with us,” Seymore said. “The pain I felt 42 years ago while birthing you doesn't compare to the pain with your message out of our lives.”

Casey was last seen attending the Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat on Paradise Island, Bahamas on June 19. She was reported missing on June 20. The family said they are expecting a case update from the Royal Bahamas Police Force on Friday.

Seymore traveled to the Bahamas two weeks ago to join the Royal Bahamas Police Force in searching for her daughter.

The Royal Bahamas Police Force said in a press conference Monday that Casey's phone was found in over 50 feet of water. Both Bahamian and U.S. authorities have been trying to access her phone’s contents, but neither party has been successful so far, police said.

The Royal Bahamas Police Force also announced Tuesday that Michael Johnson, chief superintendent and officer in charge of the criminal investigation department and who also was involved in the search for Casey, was suspended due to ""a concerning voice note” circulating on social media. They did not specify what the voice note entailed.

Speakers at Thursday’s press conference included Seymore, friends of Casey, a spokesperson for Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, and leaders from Black-LGBTQ+ spaces in Chicago.

The family also said that Casey, who is transgender, is part of the demographic of transgender people of color who are at a higher risk of violence, both in the U.S. and abroad.

“Too often our Black trans and gender-expansive siblings go missing with little to no attention in the media or investigation by the authorities,"" Jackie Boyd, a friend of Casey’s, said in a press release issued ahead of Thursday’s conference. “We are extremely concerned for Taylor’s safety and need your support in keeping the pressure on American and Bahamian authorities.”

In the same press release, Casey's family cited statistics from the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group, which claim that 68% of homicide victims in the U.S. transgender community this year were people of color.

Kennedy Bartley, managing deputy of external relations for Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson’s office, said at Thursday's press conference that she shared the mayor's heartbreak over Casey’s disappearance. Bartley also acknowledged that Casey’s disappearance is part of a larger problem of violence against LGBTQ+ people of color.

“Taylor, like too many Black women and girls, particularly those of the queer and trans communities, go missing and it seems that it's just the community that cares. But not today,” Bartley said.

Casey’s best friend, Emily Williams, who traveled to the Bahamas with Seymore, said they want answers about Casey's disappearance, and called on lawmakers, including Illinois Senators Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, to step in and help them.

“To Taylor, I say we'd love you. We're thinking of you. We will celebrate your life,” Williams said.",A person with a blurred face wearing a white cap and glasses stands in front of a house with a blue sky in the background.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA5737880>,2024-07-11 18:26:05+00:00,https://abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/US/celebrate-life-family-missing-trans-woman-calls-attention/story?id=111842274,['Local/Regional' 'Other' 'Health'],[0.85 0.75 0.7 ],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/8d62c49ab4.png

When Prison and Mental Illness Amount to a Death Sentence

The downward spiral of one inmate, Markus Johnson, shows the larger failures of the nation’s prisons to care for the mentally ill.

Credit...

Published May 5, 2024Updated May 7, 2024

Markus Johnson slumped naked against the wall of his cell, skin flecked with pepper spray, his face a mask of puzzlement, exhaustion and resignation. Four men in black tactical gear pinned him, his face to the concrete, to cuff his hands behind his back.

He did not resist. He couldn’t. He was so gravely dehydrated he would be dead by their next shift change.

“I didn’t do anything,” Mr. Johnson moaned as they pressed a shield between his shoulders.

It was 1:19 p.m. on Sept. 6, 2019, in the Danville Correctional Center, a medium-security prison a few hours south of Chicago. Mr. Johnson, 21 and serving a short sentence for gun possession, was in the throes of a mental collapse that had gone largely untreated, but hardly unwatched.

He had entered in good health, with hopes of using the time to gain work skills. But for the previous three weeks, Mr. Johnson, who suffered from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, had refused to eat or take his medication. Most dangerous of all, he had stealthily stopped drinking water, hastening the physical collapse that often accompanies full-scale mental crises.

Mr. Johnson’s horrific downward spiral, which has not been previously reported, represents the larger failures of the nation’s prisons to care for the mentally ill. Many seriously ill people receive no treatment. For those who do, the outcome is often determined by the vigilance and commitment of individual supervisors and frontline staff, which vary greatly from system to system, prison to prison, and even shift to shift.

The country’s jails and prisons have become its largest provider of inpatient mental health treatment, with 10 times as many seriously mentally ill people now held behind bars as in hospitals. Estimating the population of incarcerated people with major psychological problems is difficult, but the number is likely 200,000 to 300,000, experts say.

Many of these institutions remain ill-equipped to handle such a task, and the burden often falls on prison staff and health care personnel who struggle with the dual roles of jailer and caregiver in a high-stress, dangerous, often dehumanizing environment.

In 2021, Joshua McLemore, a 29-year-old with schizophrenia held for weeks in an isolation cell in Jackson County, Ind., died of organ failure resulting from a “refusal to eat or drink,” according to an autopsy. In April, New York City agreed to pay $28 million to settle a lawsuit filed by the family of Nicholas Feliciano, a young man with a history of mental illness who suffered severe brain damage after attempting to hang himself on Rikers Island — as correctional officers stood by.

Mr. Johnson’s mother has filed a wrongful-death suit against the state and Wexford Health Sources, a for-profit health care contractor in Illinois prisons. The New York Times reviewed more than 1,500 pages of reports, along with depositions taken from those involved. Together, they reveal a cascade of missteps, missed opportunities, potential breaches of protocol and, at times, lapses in common sense.

Prison officials and Wexford staff took few steps to intervene even after it became clear that Mr. Johnson, who had been hospitalized repeatedly for similar episodes and recovered, had refused to take medication. Most notably, they did not transfer him to a state prison facility that provides more intensive mental health treatment than is available at regular prisons, records show.

The quality of medical care was also questionable, said Mr. Johnson’s lawyers, Sarah Grady and Howard Kaplan, a married legal team in Chicago. Mr. Johnson lost 50 to 60 pounds during three weeks in solitary confinement, but officials did not initiate interventions like intravenous feedings or transfer him to a non-prison hospital.

And they did not take the most basic step — dialing 911 — until it was too late.

There have been many attempts to improve the quality of mental health treatment in jails and prisons by putting care on par with punishment — including a major effort in Chicago. But improvements have proved difficult to enact and harder to sustain, hampered by funding and staffing shortages.

Lawyers representing the state corrections department, Wexford and staff members who worked at Danville declined to comment on Mr. Johnson’s death, citing the unresolved litigation. In their interviews with state police investigators, and in depositions, employees defended their professionalism and adherence to procedure, while citing problems with high staff turnover, difficult work conditions, limited resources and shortcomings of co-workers.

But some expressed a sense of resignation about the fate of Mr. Johnson and others like him.

Prisoners have “much better chances in a hospital, but that’s not their situation,” said a senior member of Wexford’s health care team in a deposition.

“I didn’t put them in prison,” he added. “They are in there for a reason.”

‘My son’

Markus Mison Johnson was born on March 1, 1998, to a mother who believed she was not capable of caring for him.

Days after his birth, he was taken in by Lisa Barker Johnson, a foster mother in her 30s who lived in Zion, Ill., a working-class city halfway between Chicago and Milwaukee. Markus eventually became one of four children she adopted from different families.

The Johnson house is a lively split level, with nieces, nephews, grandchildren and neighbors’ children, family keepsakes, video screens and juice boxes. Ms. Johnson sits at its center on a kitchen chair, chin resting on her hand as children wander over to share their thoughts, or to tug on her T-shirt to ask her to be their bathroom buddy.

From the start, her bond with Markus was particularly powerful, in part because the two looked so much alike, with distinctive dimpled smiles. Many neighbors assumed he was her biological son. The middle name she chose for him was intended to convey that message.

“Mison is short for ‘my son,’” she said standing over his modest footstone grave last summer.

He was happy at home. School was different. His grades were good, but he was intensely shy and was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in elementary school.

That was around the time the bullying began. His sisters were fierce defenders, but they could only do so much. He did the best he could, developing a quick, taunting tongue.

These experiences filled him with a powerful yearning to fit in.

It was not to be.

When he was around 15, he called 911 in a panic, telling the dispatcher he saw two men standing near the small park next to his house threatening to abduct children playing there. The officers who responded found nothing out of the ordinary, and rang the Johnsons’ doorbell.

He later told his mother he had heard a voice telling him to “protect the kids.”

He was hospitalized for the first time at 16, and given medications that stabilized him for stretches of time. But the crises would strike every six months or so, often triggered by his decision to stop taking his medication.

His family became adept at reading signs he was “getting sick.” He would put on his tan Timberlands and a heavy winter coat, no matter the season, and perch on the edge of his bed as if bracing for battle. Sometimes, he would cook his own food, paranoid that someone might poison him.

He graduated six months early, on the dean’s list, but was rudderless, and hanging out with younger boys, often paying their way.

His mother pointed out the perils of buying friendship.

“I don’t care,” he said. “At least I’ll be popular for a minute.”

Zion’s inviting green grid of Bible-named streets belies the reality that it is a rough, unforgiving place to grow up. Family members say Markus wanted desperately to prove he was tough, and emulated his younger, reckless group of friends.

Like many of them, he obtained a pistol. He used it to hold up a convenience store clerk for $425 in January 2017, according to police records. He cut a plea deal for two years of probation, and never explained to his family what had made him do it.

But he kept getting into violent confrontations. In late July 2018, he was arrested in a neighbor’s garage with a handgun he later admitted was his. He was still on probation for the robbery, and his public defender negotiated a plea deal that would send him to state prison until January 2020.

An inpatient mental health system

Around 40 percent of the about 1.8 million people in local, state and federal jails and prison suffer from at least one mental illness, and many of these people have concurrent issues with substance abuse, according to recent Justice Department estimates.

Psychological problems, often exacerbated by drug use, often lead to significant medical problems resulting from a lack of hygiene or access to good health care.

“When you suffer depression in the outside world, it’s hard to concentrate, you have reduced energy, your sleep is disrupted, you have a very gloomy outlook, so you stop taking care of yourself,” said Robert L. Trestman, a Virginia Tech medical school professor who has worked on state prison mental health reforms.

The paradox is that prison is often the only place where sick people have access to even minimal care.

But the harsh work environment, remote location of many prisons, and low pay have led to severe shortages of corrections staff and the unwillingness of doctors, nurses and counselors to work with the incarcerated mentally ill.

In the early 2000s, prisoners’ rights lawyers filed a class-action lawsuit against Illinois claiming “deliberate indifference” to the plight of about 5,000 mentally ill prisoners locked in segregated units and denied treatment and medication.

In 2014, the parties reached a settlement that included minimum staffing mandates, revamped screening protocols, restrictions on the use of solitary confinement and the allocation of about $100 million to double capacity in the system’s specialized mental health units.

Yet within six months of the deal, Pablo Stewart, an independent monitor chosen to oversee its enforcement, declared the system to be in a state of emergency.

Over the years, some significant improvements have been made. But Dr. Stewart’s final report, drafted in 2022, gave the system failing marks for its medication and staffing policies and reliance on solitary confinement “crisis watch” cells.

Ms. Grady, one of Mr. Johnson’s lawyers, cited an additional problem: a lack of coordination between corrections staff and Wexford’s professionals, beyond dutifully filling out dozens of mandated status reports.

“Markus Johnson was basically documented to death,” she said.

‘I’m just trying to keep my head up’

Mr. Johnson was not exactly looking forward to prison. But he saw it as an opportunity to learn a trade so he could start a family when he got out.

On Dec. 18, 2018, he arrived at a processing center in Joliet, where he sat for an intake interview. He was coherent and cooperative, well-groomed and maintained eye contact. He was taking his medication, not suicidal and had a hearty appetite. He was listed as 5 feet 6 inches tall and 256 pounds.

Mr. Johnson described his mood as “go with the flow.”

A few days later, after arriving in Danville, he offered a less settled assessment during a telehealth visit with a Wexford psychiatrist, Dr. Nitin Thapar. Mr. Johnson admitted to being plagued by feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness and “constant uncontrollable worrying” that affected his sleep.

He told Dr. Thapar he had heard voices in the past — but not now — telling him he was a failure, and warning that people were out to get him.

At the time he was incarcerated, the basic options for mentally ill people in Illinois prisons included placement in the general population or transfer to a special residential treatment program at the Dixon Correctional Center, west of Chicago. Mr. Johnson seemed out of immediate danger, so he was assigned to a standard two-man cell in the prison’s general population, with regular mental health counseling and medication.

Things started off well enough. “I’m just trying to keep my head up,” he wrote to his mother. “Every day I learn to be stronger & stronger.”

But his daily phone calls back home hinted at friction with other inmates. And there was not much for him to do after being turned down for a janitorial training program.

Then, in the spring of 2019, his grandmother died, sending him into a deep hole.

Dr. Thapar prescribed a new drug used to treat major depressive disorders. Its most common side effect is weight gain. Mr. Johnson stopped taking it.

On July 4, he told Dr. Thapar matter-of-factly during a telehealth check-in that he was no longer taking any of his medications. “I’ve been feeling normal, I guess,” he said. “I feel like I don’t need the medication anymore.”

Dr. Thapar said he thought that was a mistake, but accepted the decision and removed Mr. Johnson from his regular mental health caseload — instructing him to “reach out” if he needed help, records show.

The pace of calls back home slackened. Mr. Johnson spent more time in bed, and became more surly. At a group-therapy session, he sat stone silent, after showing up late.

By early August, he was telling guards he had stopped eating.

At some point, no one knows when, he had intermittently stopped drinking fluids.

‘I’m having a breakdown’

Then came the crash.

On Aug. 12, Mr. Johnson got into a fight with his older cellmate.

He was taken to a one-man disciplinary cell. A few hours later, Wexford’s on-site mental health counselor, Melanie Easton, was shocked by his disoriented condition. Mr. Johnson stared blankly, then burst into tears when asked if he had “suffered a loss in the previous six months.”

He was so unresponsive to her questions she could not finish the evaluation.

Ms. Easton ordered that he be moved to a 9-foot by 8-foot crisis cell — solitary confinement with enhanced monitoring. At this moment, a supervisor could have ticked the box for “residential treatment” on a form to transfer him to Dixon. That did not happen, according to records and depositions.

Around this time, he asked to be placed back on his medication but nothing seems to have come of it, records show.

By mid-August, he said he was visualizing “people that were not there,” according to case notes. At first, he was acting more aggressively, once flicking water at a guard through a hole in his cell door. But his energy ebbed, and he gradually migrated downward — from standing to bunk to floor.

“I’m having a breakdown,” he confided to a Wexford employee.

At the time, inmates in Illinois were required to declare an official hunger strike before prison officials would initiate protocols, including blood testing or forced feedings. But when a guard asked Mr. Johnson why he would not eat, he said he was “fasting,” as opposed to starving himself, and no action seems to have been taken.

‘Tell me this is OK!’

Lt. Matthew Morrison, one of the few people at Danville to take a personal interest in Mr. Johnson, reported seeing a white rind around his mouth in early September. He told other staff members the cell gave off “a death smell,” according to a deposition.

On Sept. 5, they moved Mr. Johnson to one of six cells adjacent to the prison’s small, bare-bones infirmary. Prison officials finally placed him on the official hunger strike protocol without his consent.

Mr. Morrison, in his deposition, said he was troubled by the inaction of the Wexford staff, and the lack of urgency exhibited by the medical director, Dr. Justin Young.

On Sept. 5, Mr. Morrison approached Dr. Young to express his concerns, and the doctor agreed to order blood and urine tests. But Dr. Young lived in Chicago, and was on site at the prison about four times a week, according to Mr. Kaplan. Friday, Sept. 6, 2019, was not one of those days.

Mr. Morrison arrived at work that morning, expecting to find Mr. Johnson’s testing underway. A Wexford nurse told him Dr. Young believed the tests could wait.

Mr. Morrison, stunned, asked her to call Dr. Young.

“He’s good till Monday,” Dr. Young responded, according to Mr. Morrison.

“Come on, come on, look at this guy! You tell me this is OK!” the officer responded.

Eventually, Justin Duprey, a licensed nurse practitioner and the most senior Wexford employee on duty that day, authorized the test himself.

Mr. Morrison, thinking he had averted a disaster, entered the cell and implored Mr. Johnson into taking the tests. He refused.

So prison officials obtained approval to remove him forcibly from his cell.

‘Oh, my God’

What happened next is documented in video taken from cameras held by officers on the extraction team and obtained by The Times through a court order.

Mr. Johnson is scarcely recognizable as the neatly groomed 21-year-old captured in a cellphone picture a few months earlier. His skin is ashen, eyes fixed on the middle distance. He might be 40. Or 60.

At first, he places his hands forward through the hole in his cell door to be cuffed. This is against procedure, the officers shout. His hands must be in back.

He will not, or cannot, comply. He wanders to the rear of his cell and falls hard. Two blasts of pepper spray barely elicit a reaction. The leader of the tactical team later said he found it unusual and unnerving.

The next video is in the medical unit. A shield is pressed to his chest. He is in agony, begging for them to stop, as two nurses attempt to insert a catheter.

Then they move him, half-conscious and limp, onto a wheelchair for the blood draw.

For the next 20 minutes, the Wexford nurse performing the procedure, Angelica Wachtor, jabs hands and arms to find a vessel that will hold shape. She winces with each puncture, tries to comfort him, and grows increasingly rattled.

“Oh, my God,” she mutters, and asks why help is not on the way.

She did not request assistance or discuss calling 911, records indicate.

“Can you please stop — it’s burning real bad,” Mr. Johnson said.

Soon after, a member of the tactical team reminds Ms. Wachtor to take Mr. Johnson’s vitals before taking him back to his cell. She would later tell Dr. Young she had been unable to able to obtain his blood pressure.

“You good?” one of the team members asks as they are preparing to leave.

“Yeah, I’ll have to be,” she replies in the recording.

Officers lifted him back onto his bunk, leaving him unconscious and naked except for a covering draped over his groin. His expressionless face is visible through the window on the cell door as it closes.

‘Cardiac arrest.’

Mr. Duprey, the nurse practitioner, had been sitting inside his office after corrections staff ordered him to shelter for his own protection, he said. When he emerged, he found Ms. Wachtor sobbing, and after a delay, he was let into the cell. Finding no pulse, Mr. Duprey asked a prison employee to call 911 so Mr. Johnson could be taken to a local emergency room.

The Wexford staff initiated CPR. It did not work.

At 3:38 p.m., the paramedics declared Markus Mison Johnson dead.

Afterward, a senior official at Danville called the Johnson family to say he had died of “cardiac arrest.”

Lisa Johnson pressed for more information, but none was initially forthcoming. She would soon receive a box hastily crammed with his possessions: uneaten snacks, notebooks, an inspirational memoir by a man who had served 20 years at Leavenworth.

Later, Shiping Bao, the coroner who examined his body, determined Mr. Johnson had died of severe dehydration. He told the state police it “was one of the driest bodies he had ever seen.”

For a long time, Ms. Johnson blamed herself. She says that her biggest mistake was assuming that the state, with all its resources, would provide a level of care comparable to what she had been able to provide her son.

She had stopped accepting foster care children while she was raising Markus and his siblings. But as the months dragged on, she decided her once-boisterous house had become oppressively still, and let local agencies know she was available again.

39b41553ef,Reuters,Trump courts RFK Jr's support in leaked phone call - Reuters,"NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump suggested to Robert F. Kennedy Jr that the independent presidential candidate could do something to support the Trump campaign, according to a video of a phone call on Sunday posted on social media and confirmed by Kennedy.

""I would love you to do something – and I think it would be so good for you and so big for you,"" Trump can be heard saying via speaker phone in the video, apparently referring to the 2024 election race.

""We're gonna win,"" Trump said, after which Kennedy said, ""Yeah.""

""We're way ahead of the guy,"" Trump added, referring to Democratic incumbent President Joe Biden.

Kennedy supporters range across the political spectrum, from liberal to conservative to independent, and some polls show he would draw voters from Trump and Biden both.

Trump also spoke to Kennedy about Saturday's assassination attempt, saying that the bullet that hit his ear ""felt like a giant - like the world's largest mosquito.""

Of Biden's phone call with Trump after the assassination attempt, Trump said, ""It was very nice actually.""

Trump's phone call with Kennedy also included a conversation about vaccines, which echoed some of Kennedy's earlier views. The environmental lawyer has spread misinformation on vaccines for years.

""When you feed a baby, Bobby,"" Trump said, ""a vaccination that is like 38 different vaccines, and it looks like it's meant for a horse, not a, you know, 10-pound or 20-pound baby... and then you see the baby all of a sudden starting to change radically.

""And then you hear that it doesn't have an impact, right? But you and I talked about that a long time ago.""

After the call spread on social media, Kennedy on Tuesday apologized to Trump on social media platform X, formerly Twitter. ""When President Trump called me I was taping with an in-house videographer,"" he wrote. ""I should have ordered the videographer to stop recording immediately. I am mortified that this was posted.""

A day earlier, Kennedy posted on X about meeting with Trump, writing, ""Our main topic was national unity, and I hope to meet with Democratic leaders about that as well. No, I am not dropping out of the race.""

The Democratic Party views Kennedy, who began the race as a Democratic candidate before declaring himself independent, as an election ""spoiler"" who would take votes away from Biden and in effect help Trump win the White House.

Democratic National Committee spokesperson Matt Corridoni said on X that Kennedy also had dinner with conservative political commentator Tucker Carlson at the Republican National Convention, taking place in Milwaukee this week.

""He (Kennedy) has no path to victory in this race and is nothing more than a spoiler for Trump,"" said DNC Communications Adviser Lis Smith.

The Kennedy campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

aedecd2872,Financial Times,Iran’s reformist candidate jolts presidential race with nuclear pitch - Financial Times,"The reformist contender in Iran’s presidential election has put his hardline rivals on the back foot by thrusting the revival of nuclear talks with world powers and the compulsory hijab at the centre of the political debate.

On the campaign trail this week, Masoud Pezeshkian has made clear that if he were to win the June 28 vote, he would seek improved relations with the west over Iran’s nuclear programme to ease US sanctions and would take a softer stance on requiring women to cover their heads.

His focus on contentious issues has rattled rivals, underscoring how authorities’ surprise decision to approve the reformist’s candidacy has shaken up an election that many had expected to be a predictable contest between regime-approved conservatives.

The 69-year-old’s strategy is part of his efforts to woo disillusioned voters, particularly among the younger generations, by convincing them that presidential elections in the theocracy do matter and that the outcome of next week’s vote could usher in change.

Turnout fell to a record low in the last presidential election, with many voters staying away to avoid legitimising the regime and to express their anger with what they saw as a flawed process.

To energise reformist voters, the former health minister has laid out a starkly different policy platform in an election hastily called after President Ebrahim Raisi, a hardline cleric, was killed in a helicopter crash last month.

“I have come to address your problems . . . to be the voice of those whose voices are not heard,” Pezeshkian told a rally. “Generation Z’s problem is us. They want change, but we have not changed. They want innovation, but we have not been into innovation.”

He has championed talks to lift sanctions imposed by the US because of Iran’s nuclear programme, a “disaster” for the republic’s ailing economy that have fuelled corruption within the regime.

Pezeshkian, a surgeon, has also argued that there are no Islamic texts that permit authorities to harass or arrest women for not wearing the hijab. The topic remains highly sensitive since mass anti-regime protests in 2022 following the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who died in police custody after being arrested over the hijab.

Leading hardline candidates have struggled to respond to Pezeshkian’s campaign, with Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the speaker of parliament widely seen as frontrunner, and Saeed Jalili, a senior regime figure, both conspicuously vague on the nuclear crisis and the hijab.

Their core supporters, which include diehard regime loyalists, want no relaxation of the hijab laws and are ideologically opposed to engaging with the west or making significant concessions to lift US sanctions.

But they are also aware that a large constituency of Iranians are desperate for sanctions relief and improved relations with the west, and are enraged by the regime’s social restrictions, including the hijab law.

Pezeshkian’s challenge lies in convincing millions of Iranians who have lost faith in elections to vote so that he has a shot at defeating his rivals, or at least forcing a second round.

Just 48 per cent of voters turned out for the 2021 presidential election that brought Raisi to power. Spoiled ballots outnumbered those cast for the sole reformist candidate Abdolnaser Hemmati as millions of Iranians boycotted the poll.

Analysts said Pezeshkian, who is regarded as having broader appeal than Hemmati, would need a far higher turnout to break through in the race. Crucially, Pezeshkian’s candidacy has been backed by the reformist establishment, including Javad Zarif, a former foreign minister who is one of Iran’s most high-profile figures.

Alongside Pezeshkian in a question-and-answer session broadcast on state television, Zarif reminded voters that while key decisions had to be approved by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the president still had significant influence on economic and foreign policies.

“Without a reasonable foreign policy . . . we cannot push for economic benefits . . . and cannot even have good relations with our friends,” Zarif said. He highlighted that after the nuclear accord was implemented in 2016, leading to sanctions relief, Iran’s inflation fell from about 40 per cent to single digits, spurring double-digit economic growth.

That progress was reversed after former US president Donald Trump abandoned the accord in 2018 and imposed waves of sanctions on Iran. Raisi’s hardline government held indirect talks with the Biden administration on reviving the deal, but they made little progress as Tehran aggressively expanded its nuclear activity.

Zarif held up economic charts as he blamed hardliners’ policies for runaway inflation and other economic problems. “People, see what has happened to your inflation?” he said. “People, see what has happened to your economic growth? People, see what has happened to your oil sales?”

Pezeshkian’s campaign faces the uphill task of motivating Iran’s disillusioned voters in contrast to a conservative base that is easily mobilised.

“I don’t even know who the candidates are and don’t follow their news,” said Maryam, a 45-year-old private sector employee who had voted for reformists before. “Neither me nor anyone I know would vote.”","A man in a blue shirt is surrounded by people, some of whom are taking photos with their phones.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BCAC85DB0>,2024-06-20 10:00:01.773000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/8c57562b-834e-4c52-b9dd-3a0c13ade800,['Politics' 'International'],[0.9 0.8],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/aedecd2872.png
f859ce93ed,National Review,Kamala Harris Selects Progressive Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as Running Mate - National Review,"Vice President Kamala Harris selected progressive Minnesota governor Tim Walz on Tuesday to be her running mate for her 2024 presidential campaign, a move meant to placate the far-left faction of her party and appeal to the midwesterners Harris needs to win in November.

“I am proud to announce that I’ve asked @Tim_Walz to be my running mate,” Harris said on X, with a link to donate to the Harris-Walz campaign.

“As a governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran, he’s delivered for working families like his,” she added.

“It’s great to have him on the team.”

The announcement comes ahead of Harris’s Tuesday evening campaign rally in Philadelphia, which is expected to be the largest of her presidential run thus far.

Walz and Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro were the two remaining finalists for Harris’s vice presidential nod after Senator Mark Kelly (D., Ariz.), Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and Kentucky governor Andy Beshear (D) fell out of contention.

“It is the honor of a lifetime to join @kamalaharris in this campaign,” Walz said on X. “Vice President Harris is showing us the politics of what’s possible. It reminds me a bit of the first day of school.”

A military veteran and former teacher, Walz began his political career with a narrow victory over a Republican incumbent in a 2006 congressional race. He won reelection five times and became a reliably liberal Democratic member.

In 2018, Walz won the Minnesota gubernatorial election, and four years later comfortably held the seat after presiding over the race riots sparked by the death of George Floyd. Minnesota Democrats secured a legislative trifecta in 2022, and Walz subsequently signed progressive legislation on issues ranging from abortion and guns to school lunches and noncompete agreements.

Republicans will likely highlight Walz’s progressive record and the fraud scandals the Minnesota government has suffered under his watch. They will also point out that, as Minnesota governor, Walz failed to stop the 2020 riots, allowing widespread looting and property damage, including the ransacking of a police precinct.

“It’s no surprise that San Francisco Liberal Kamala Harris wants West Coast wannabe Tim Walz as her running-mate – Walz has spent his governorship trying to reshape Minnesota in the image of the Golden State,” said Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt.

“From proposing his own carbon-free agenda, to suggesting stricter emission standards for gas-powered cars, and embracing policies to allow convicted felons to vote, Walz is obsessed with spreading California’s dangerously liberal agenda far and wide.”

By selecting Walz over Shapiro, Harris is hoping the progressive wing of the Democratic party will continue backing her candidacy as she quietly walks back the radical stances she took four years ago, when she lurched to the left for a short-lived presidential run.

Shapiro, a Jew, would have received major backlash from progressives for his support for Israel’s war against Hamas. While his position on the war itself is mainstream among establishment Democrats, he did condemn antisemitic protests on college campuses and volunteered for a non-combat role with the IDF when he was in college.

Walz, by contrast, has spoken sympathetically about the left-wing anti-Israel protests that have become a fixture across America since Hamas slaughtered 1,200 civilians and took 25o hostages on October 7th.

Last night, Walz fundraised for Harris in Minneapolis alongside other Democratic party leaders, auditioning for the vice presidential nomination and lavishing Harris with praise. He will now be joining Harris on a swing-state campaign tour after she officially secured the Democratic nomination with 99 percent of the party’s delegates voting for her virtually.

“Kamala Harris did not pick Josh Shapiro because antisemitic progressives did not like that he is Jewish. It was Harris’ first major decision as the nominee and she caved to the pro-Hamas contingency within the Democratic Party,” said Mike Berg, a spokesman for the GOP’s senate campaign arm.

“Tim Walz reinforces Kamala Harris’ biggest weaknesses: crime and immigration. Kamala Harris helped bankroll the 2020 riots in Minnesota when she promoted the Minnesota Freedom Fund – Walz let Minnesota burn. Kamala Harris supported decriminalizing illegal immigration and abolishing ICE – Walz supported making Minnesota a sanctuary state.”

Representative Alexandra Ocasio-Cortex (D., N.Y.), said Harris made an “excellent decision” choosing Walz as her running mate, reflecting the progressive excitement about the pick.

“Together, they will govern effectively, inclusively, and boldly for the American people,” she said on X. “They won’t back down under tight odds, either – from healthcare to school lunch.”","Two individuals are shown, one with a blurred face and the other with a clear face, both wearing suits, with a flag in the background.",<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x131 at 0x7D6BA3BBFB20>,2024-08-06 13:08:26+00:00,https://www.nationalreview.com,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/kamala-harris-selects-progressive-minnesota-governor-tim-walz-as-running-mate/,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/f859ce93ed.png
6bb12c6828,The Guardian,‘Definitely not Tory’: will Thatcher’s home town vote for first Labour MP? - The Guardian,"There were hints of a sunny afternoon in Grantham on Monday when the skies kept clouding over, producing on-off moments of drizzle. But if the weather was undecided, that was nothing compared to the voters, with less than two days left until the general election.

“We watched the debates but we still don’t know,” said John Lyon, a retired bricklayer going to the bank with his wife, Jane, a retired chef.

In parallel with the wider constituency, the Lyons have always been Tory voters. “I think I will vote for the Tories this time because if everyone votes for the smaller parties, like Green or Reform, Labour will get in,” John said.

He may be right: projections show there is a real chance on Thursday of what would be the first ever Labour victory in Margaret Thatcher’s home town.

The true blue constituency has never voted Labour, not even during the New Labour landslide of 1997, when huge swathes of the country left the Tories behind.

Grantham continued to resist the pull, with the Conservative vote share only increasing every election. By 2019, Gareth Davies, the incumbent Tory MP, had a whopping 66% of the vote.

But such is the disastrous polling for Rishi Sunak’s party that on Friday morning, voters in the seat of Grantham and Bourne, renamed from Grantham and Stamford to take into account a boundary change, could be waking up to their first elected Labour MP. There was one period in 2007, when their MP Quentin Davies defected to Labour, but as soon as voters had the chance in 2010 Labour was relegated to third place with a solid Conservative win.

Though a boundary change is a factor in the town’s potential new switch of allegiance, projections from the consultancy Electoral Calculus using the old boundary show Labour would still steal the seat from the Tories. In other words, people in Grantham are likely to vote for change.

“It’s hard to decide how I’ll vote at the moment,” said Angela Page. “Definitely not Conservative. Covid changed things for me, there were too many lies.”

She had been a Conservative voter in previous elections, having come from a family with strong Conservative views. “People around here are staunch Margaret Thatcher fans so it’s a big change for us,” she said, beneath a 3-metre-tall bronze statue of the Iron Lady that was proudly erected in the centre of the town in 2022, costing £300,000. “Generally, people can’t trust what we have now. I just want trust. We need people who will make the correct decisions for the country.”

She began as a “big fan” of Keir Starmer, she said, delighted that he had taken over from Jeremy Corbyn who she – and most people who spoke to the Guardian in Grantham – did not like. “But now he’s morphing into other politicians. He’s not standing out.

“I was a Sunak fan, he tries and he works hard, but I couldn’t bear Boris Johnson. I always said that if he got back in I would emigrate.”

Even with Thatcher looming overhead, dressed in the full ceremonial robes of the House of Lords, Page said she felt “no guilt whatsoever” about ditching the Tories. “It’s just time. We need fresh input and that could have come from the Conservatives, but it didn’t.”

Others felt the same. “The Conservatives are not doing any good, nothing’s improved,” said Rosemarie Barks, picking up a prescription in the town centre with her husband, Trevor. “I haven’t voted Tory before but this time I really think they’ve shown their true colours. It’s been scandals one after another.”

The couple said they had never felt proud of the association with Thatcher. “Her dad was known to be a miser,” Trevor said, but he added that they liked to see someone who had worked hard to get to where they are.

“Starmer came from the bottom and worked his way up, we need to give him a chance,” said Rosemarie.

Not everyone agreed with this. “Labour used to be for the person who was working. Now it’s all about handouts to make it easier for the people who don’t want to work,” said Terri Rogan, who was having lunch on a bench with her colleague Caroline Henson, from the healthcare clinic. “But the Conservatives just want to line their own pockets and the pockets of their friends.”

Henson said: “I used to be Conservative but I don’t believe a word any of them say. It’s all empty promises.”

So, what could anyone do to win their votes in the final few days of the election campaign? “Be tougher with immigrants,” said Rogan. Immigration was on many people’s minds in Grantham – a local hotel had been used to house refugees who were then “hanging around the town centre” to the frustration of many locals.

But Reform UK is predicted only to come third here, which was because, as Rogan put it, “they’re just focusing on immigration, they don’t seem to have a plan beyond that. Farage pops up and I just think ‘whatever mate, sod off’.”

“Which paper did you say you were from?” said Rogan, when asked if the Guardian could take their picture. “Oh that’s fine, nobody we know is going to see the Guardian.”","A man and a woman stand on the steps of the Guildhall Arts Centre, holding a blue bag with 'KEEP COOL' written on it, in front of a sign that reads 'Guildhall Arts Centre'.

2874df9643,The New York Times,China Is Testing More Driverless Cars Than Any Other Country - The New York Times,"The world’s largest experiment in driverless cars is underway on the busy streets of Wuhan, a city in central China with 11 million people, 4.5 million cars, eight-lane expressways and towering bridges over the muddy waters of the Yangtze River.

A fleet of 500 taxis navigated by computers, often with no safety drivers in them for backup, buzz around. The company that operates them, the tech giant Baidu, said last month that it would add a further 1,000 of the so-called robot taxis in Wuhan.

Across China, 16 or more cities have allowed companies to test driverless vehicles on public roads, and at least 19 Chinese automakers and their suppliers are competing to establish global leadership in the field. No other country is moving as aggressively.

The government is providing the companies significant help. In addition to cities designating on-road testing areas for robot taxis, censors are limiting online discussion of safety incidents and crashes to restrain public fears about the nascent technology.

Another reason for China’s lead in the development of driverless cars is its strict and ever-tightening control of data. Chinese companies set up crucial research facilities in the United States and Europe and sent the results back home. But any research in China is not allowed to leave the country. As a result, it’s difficult for foreign carmakers to use what they learn in China for cars they sell in other countries.

Then there are the safety issues. As China charges ahead, companies and regulators elsewhere have become more cautious.

The Cruise robot taxi service of General Motors halted service in the United States last fall after one of its cars in San Francisco hit and dragged a pedestrian who had been knocked into its path by a human driver. California regulators later suspended the company’s state license. Cruise has resumed limited testing in Phoenix.

Waymo, formerly Google’s self-driving car division, is testing more than 200 self-driving cars in the Phoenix suburbs and in San Francisco, as well as nearly 50 in Los Angeles and in Austin, Texas. Waymo was notified twice by federal regulators last month that they were reviewing its safety.

Ford and Volkswagen shut down their robot taxi joint venture, Argo AI, two years ago, but both companies are still developing advanced assisted driving systems.

Last fall, Japan suspended its test of driverless golf carts that travel seven miles per hour after one of them hit the pedal of a parked bicycle. No one was injured. The testing resumed in March.

Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, announced on April 5 a “Tesla Robotaxi unveil on 8/8.”

Many Chinese makers of electric cars are introducing advanced assisted driving features on their mass-production cars.

On June 4, Beijing authorized nine Chinese automakers — including Nio, BYD and SAIC Motor — to begin tests of advanced assisted driving systems that go beyond Tesla’s Full Self-Driving. At least initially, the tests will be done in restricted areas, not on public roads.

Baidu and Huawei, the electronics giant, are supplying part or all of these automated systems to many Chinese automakers. Baidu also has a joint venture with Zhejiang Geely, called Jiyue, to make driverless cars.

The China Society of Automotive Engineers forecasts that 20 percent of the cars sold in China in 2030 will be completely driverless and that another 70 percent will have advanced assisted driving technology.

Predicting the future popularity of driverless cars in the United States is difficult because it depends on how quickly carmakers switch to electric vehicles. Driverless technology works much better with battery electric cars than with gasoline-powered cars or most hybrid gasoline-electric cars. Electric motors can increase or decrease power with less of a lag and in more finely controlled increments.

In China, battery electric cars represent about 25 percent of the market, compared with 7 percent in the United States.

As with many technologies, including electric car batteries and solar panels, Chinese companies started developing driverless cars by studying American inventions, but then leaped forward in commercializing them. In the years before the Covid-19 pandemic, more than a dozen Chinese firms set up autonomous driving research centers in California, mainly in Silicon Valley. Some, like Baidu, hired hundreds of software engineers. They obtained permission from the California Department of Transportation to test cars on public roads.

These companies moved most of their research to China during the pandemic, when Beijing sealed the country’s borders but allowed key researchers to return. They have continued to work in China.

China has been a big market for Tesla and its advanced assisted driving technologies, like Autopilot. But Beijing is now cracking down on any movement of this data out of China.

Mr. Musk visited Beijing in April to seek approval for his company to offer Full Self-Driving in China. He reached deals to keep in China any data gathered in the country, and to obtain high-resolution maps of Chinese roads through an agreement with Baidu.

China does not allow foreign companies to have direct access to high-resolution maps, which are crucial to driverless systems.

Assisted driving or driverless cars use tiny cameras mounted on their exteriors, or in some cases miniature laser systems, to collect information. Most of that data is processed by the car’s computers, which make decisions on steering and vehicle speed.

Although most of the data from cameras and lasers on cars is not uploaded to the carmakers, the potential for tracking people and mapping sensitive locations has troubled security experts.

Europe and the United States still allow manufacturers to send driving data to China, but that may change. Gina M. Raimondo, the U.S. commerce secretary, said last month that the United States would propose rules this fall to regulate cars that were electronically linked to China. Europe has also begun studying the issue.",A white driverless car is in front of a traditional Chinese archway with a modern building in the background.

f4848cd344,Financial Times,Giorgia Meloni’s hard-right European group claims a top EU job - Financial Times,"Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s hard-right European political group has said it has enough additional members in the European parliament to overtake French President Emmanuel Macron’s liberal Renew party as the assembly’s third-largest grouping, and claim a top EU job.

Meloni’s European Conservatives and Reformists group (ECR) has increased to 83 members following this month’s European parliamentary elections, in which parties of the radical right across the continent performed strongly.

If Macron’s Renew party does not expand in size before a July 4 deadline, it would mark only the second time in 40 years that the parliament’s three largest groups are not from the political centre, potentially disrupting a triumvirate that has chosen the EU’s most senior officials for decades.

A reordering of the hierarchy could complicate European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen’s push to secure a second five-year term at the helm of the EU’s executive and alter the bloc’s legislative agenda through 2029.

“Elections have shifted Europe’s centre of gravity to the right,” Meloni said on Wednesday. “I think that in the current parliament we will see that step-change in the way we approach certain policies.”

Meloni said she was now “working to organise an alternative front to the left” and negotiating with multiple factions in the European parliament to build consensus on various issues.

“Through negotiations with everyone, I think there could be some surprises on the majorities,” she added.

In her first public comments since a fractious EU heads of government dinner on Monday, Meloni slammed six leaders including Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for their attempt to stitch up a deal on who to appoint as the EU’s three most senior officials for the next five years.

Before the dinner, Scholz, of the Socialists and Democrats (S&D), the parliament’s second largest group, met Macron and leaders from the centre-right European People’s party (EPP), the assembly’s biggest bloc, to decide their candidates for the three top jobs.

Scholz and Macron reviewed plans for the EPP’s von der Leyen to have a second term. They also discussed related proposals for former Portuguese socialist prime minister António Costa to be the next European Council president, who chairs meetings of EU leaders, and Estonia’s liberal premier Kaja Kallas to be the bloc’s next chief diplomat.

“I found it surreal that some came up with proposals for names for top posts without first reflecting on what were the signals coming from citizens and what should be the change of pace on priorities,” Meloni said.

She also said she would claim “a role of the highest grade” for Italy at the EU institutions. “Everyone today knows what the role is for Italy . . . which today has the most solid government of all,” she added.

New entrants to the ECR include the ultranationalist AUR party from Romania, whose chair George Simion is banned from Ukraine and Moldova on security grounds.

An official from Renew said negotiations were continuing with potential allies and it expected to grow beyond the 80 seats it holds.

“This is a snapshot of a point in time. We have until July 4 to constitute political groups and then we can see who is third,” the official added.

The EPP has made clear that it intends to continue its alliance with the S&D and Renew in order to secure von der Leyen’s reappointment as commission president.

The three groups have more than 400 votes in the 720-strong parliament, where a simple majority of 361 is required for her to obtain a second term.

Renew and S&D have made clear they will not negotiate with the ECR, which they consider part of the far right.

“The ECR [growing] doesn’t change anything. The majority platform still has 55 per cent of the votes,” said an EPP official.

EU diplomats suggested Meloni could push for a senior commissioner, with one saying “she has influence”.

It was a mistake to antagonise her at the dinner but she will not get a seat at the negotiating table on the three top EU jobs, they added.

“She misread the situation because ECR is . . . not part of the governing majority. It’s political reality.”

75dd687827,The Washington Post,Star witness Jose Uribe testifies Menendez was all in on bribery deal - The Washington Post,"NEW YORK — A businessman who says he bribed Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) with a luxury convertible to disrupt two criminal investigations in New Jersey testified Monday that the lawmaker was anything but subtle when discussing expectations and results over dinners and cigars.

“I saved your ass twice, not once but twice,” Jose Uribe recalled Menendez telling him at a Spanish restaurant in Moonachie, N.J., in August 2020. By that point, Uribe said, Menendez had assured him that the insurance fraud investigations by the state attorney general’s office, which Uribe worried would ensnare him, had been put to bed.

“That thing you asked me about, it’s nothing there. I give you your peace,” Uribe said Menendez told him over the phone on another occasion.

In exchange for Menendez’s influence, Uribe testified that he had financed a new Mercedes-Benz for the senator’s then-girlfriend, Nadine Arslanian, starting with $15,000 he handed her in a parking lot in April 2019 and continuing with monthly installments that he covered for three years.

Taking the stand for a second day as star witness for the prosecution in Menendez’s corruption trial, Uribe, 57, described several key encounters with the couple that federal prosecutors say were textbook bribery offenses. According to Uribe, Arslanian wanted the new car and he wanted help “stopping and killing” the pair of insurance fraud investigations into several close associates in the trucking and insurance business.

After he and Arslanian struck a deal in 2019, she soon had him meeting with the senator on the screened patio of her Englewood Cliffs, N.J., home, Uribe testified. He said he brought a bottle of brandy, and the two men were left alone to talk business late at night. Menendez was chomping on a cigar.

The senator “was meeting with some authorities in New Jersey” at his office in Newark the following day and wanted the names of the businesses and associates who were the subject of subpoenas and detective inquiries, Uribe said.

“Mr. Menendez called for Nadine by saying something like ‘mon amour,’ and he also rang a bell — a little bell that he had on the table,” Uribe continued. Arslanian then brought them something so Uribe could write down those names. Menendez took the piece of paper, folded it and put it in his pants pocket, Uribe said.

According to the trial evidence, Menendez met the next day with New Jersey’s attorney general at the time, Gurbir S. Grewal, who testified last week that he immediately cut off the senator after hearing he wanted to discuss an open criminal matter. Uribe said Menendez nonetheless told him the investigations were nothing to worry about, and he started to choke up toward the end of his direct examination as he recounted his relief given the senator’s assurances.

Uribe is facing up to 95 years in prison when he is sentenced Friday. He told the jury he was hoping to avoid prison time in exchange for his cooperation in Menendez’s case. The courtroom was again packed for his second day of testimony.

He pleaded guilty this year to seven felony counts including conspiracy to commit bribery, wire fraud, tax evasion and obstruction of justice. Prosecutors in the Southern District of New York probably will recommend far less than the maximum sentence because the incriminating testimony that Uribe is giving at Menendez’s trial is a linchpin of their case.

He is the only witness expected to testify that the couple agreed to a corrupt quid pro quo.

Uribe said he first discussed the deal with the senator while dining with him and Arslanian in a secluded corner of an Italian restaurant in Carlstadt, N.J., in August 2019. “If there was anything in his power to stop this investigation, I would be grateful,” Uribe recalled telling Menendez. “I asked him to help me get peace for me and my family.”

The senator said he would “look into it,” the witness told the jury.

The last meeting came a couple years after the Menendezes had married — and after FBI agents showed up at his home in June 2022 asking about the Mercedes-Benz, Uribe testified. He met the senator’s wife at a Marriott hotel and agreed to lie about the car payments being a loan for a financially strapped friend, he said.

Menendez, 70, who has vigorously proclaimed his innocence, could face decades in prison if convicted on all charges in his indictment. Uribe, whose cross-examination began late Monday afternoon, testified that he never discussed the car payments with the lawmaker. He will return to the witness stand on Tuesday.

Nadine Menendez has also pleaded not guilty. Her trial is scheduled for next month.","A courtroom sketch of a man in a suit sitting at a desk, with a woman in the background, in front of a red wall.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x128 at 0x7D6B7E1DEBF0>,2024-06-10 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/06/10/bob-menendez-corruption-trial-jose-uribe-testimony/,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/75dd687827.png
f5f8170612,Forbes,7 Steps Colleges Can Take To Restore Confidence In Higher Ed - Forbes,"Declining confidence in higher education is tied to a number of factors, but none are more important and actionable than improving the work readiness of graduates. In order to make higher education more relevant in the eyes of the American public, colleges should ensure that the education they deliver is relevant for students seeking a good job: the majority of students identify work outcomes as their primary reason to attend. Although political polarization is among the major factors behind declining confidence, the steps that colleges can take toward mitigating it are less obvious. With regard to work readiness, however, there are clear actions colleges can take to restore confidence in higher education.

Doubts about the work readiness of college graduates run rampant in the U.S. Coupled with rising costs and growing college alternatives, these work readiness doubts have undoubtedly contributed to declines in both enrollments and public confidence. But with a clear evidence base behind ‘what works’ toward improving graduate work readiness, higher education institutions can and should create intentional and tangible plans to turn the confidence tide.

Here are seven immediate steps college and university leaders can take:

1. Provide academic credit for internships and require that all students have at least one internship or co-op experience as a graduation requirement. The requirement could be satisfied by a variety of internship formats (in-person or virtual; micro-internships or longer-term engagements). As part of this effort, establish internship scholarship funds to support students who are unable to take lower paid internships in expensive areas where summer internships are concentrated (e.g., New York, Washington D.C., and Silicon Valley).

2. Offer students the ability to add an industry-recognized credential to their degree. This helps them become the ideal graduate that employers are looking for: one that is both broadly educated and specifically skilled.

3. Ensure that work-study programs are academically integrated. Although intended as a mechanism to help underserved students afford college, work-study has rarely been woven thoughtfully into the academic core of higher education.

4. Enable faculty to explore professional development opportunities outside of academia. Given a chance to engage in modern workplaces and work challenges, faculty will find innovative and creative ways to weave more work-integrated learning into their curriculum.

5. Ensure every student completes at least one long-term project or industry-immersive program. These long-term projects and industry-immersive programs mimic and expose students to the kind of work they will be engaged in after graduation.

6. Establish an office or role dedicated to building local/regional employer partnerships to create more internship programs and long-term projects for students. Institutions such as Northeastern, Drexel and University of Cincinnati have done this for a century, proving it can be done effectively and at scale.

7. Provide industry- and role-specific career advising in addition to generalized career advice (resume reviews, building LinkedIn profiles, mock interviews, etc.) so students can gain a deeper understanding of specific roles, industries, and career pathways.",An image of a graduation cap on a torn American flag.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x224 at 0x7D6BC762FE50>,2024-08-16 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.forbes.com,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brandonbusteed/2024/08/16/7-steps-colleges-can-take-to-restore-confidence-in-higher-ed/,['Opinion/Editorial' 'National'],[0.9 0.7],Unlikely,Likely,sample_review/images/f5f8170612.png

Long-distance movers in Boston

A long-distance move means relocating more than 50 miles away or to a different state. If you're crossing state lines, you need to be especially careful that the mover you hire has the proper federal licensing. Interstate movers are required to have United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) and Motor Carrier (MC) numbers. You can use the MC number, USDOT number or mover's name to look up a carrier’s licensing status in the FMCSA’s database.

The experienced and reliable long-distance moving companies below have an active license. They can help get you and your belongings safely and smoothly across state lines.

Massachusetts moving companies that operate across state lines must have state and federal licensing. Massachusetts movers are regulated by the Department of Public Utilities (DPU). The DPU maintains an alphabetical list of licensed movers in the state on their website.

Why is moving so expensive?

The average hourly moving rate for relocating within or out of Boston is higher than the national average, making itrelatively costly. The higher moving rates make sense because the cost of living in Boston is above 98.6% of the country.

Moving costs add up quickly, as there are numerous factors involved. The following are common moving expenses:

Supplies

Storage

Junk removal

Fuel

Packing

Professional labor

These extra factors can add even more cost to your final moving bill:

Transporting specialty items

Professional movers may charge more to move certain belongings, especially those that are fragile, valuable or oversized. These items commonly cost more to move:

Artwork and sculptures

Heavy pieces of furniture or technology

Pianos

Safes

Family heirlooms or antiques

Ask potential movers whether they move these items and charge extra for them.

Tipping your movers

While tipping your movers is optional, it’s common if your movers handled your belongings with care or reduced the stress of your move. Consider tipping each mover $5–$10 per hour for local moves and $20–$40 per day for long-distance moves.

Unexpected delays

It's common for a move to be delayed due to issues such as inclement weather, a lack of supplies, transportation emergencies and traffic. These can add to your moving costs and extend your timeline. You can't prevent delays, but you can prepare for them by being flexible with your schedule and adding 25% more than your movers quote you to your budget.

How to save money on moving costs

Consider these ways to reduce moving expenses in Boston.

Be communicative

To avoid unexpected charges on your moving day, maintain open communication with your movers, particularly about items you add to your inventory after getting a quote from the movers.

For example, your movers can usually add small items to the truck without issue, but large items — like new appliances or furniture — should be discussed before the move. The movers may need to adjust their charges for these item and get your consent to these fees before beginning the move.

Have a flexible schedule

Dependable, cost-effective movers are highly sought after. Consider moving in the off-season or on a weekday to reduce costs and still book your preferred relocation service.

The busiest moving period is from May through September. If your timeline is flexible, moving during less busy months may result in less competition or lower ratesfor services.

Consider alternatives to professional movers

Consider taking an alternative route if you have difficulty findinga cheap movingcompany that works for you.

Move yourself is an option. Before going this route, consider the following costs along with the labor required:

Packing supplies

Moving truck rental

Fuel

You may also need to ask family, friends or neighbors for help loading and unloading heavy items such as furniture. Professional movers are a worthwhile investment if you lack the time or support to commit to moving yourself.

Another alternative is to hire movers on service marketplaces such as Fiverr or Thumbtack. While hiring hourly help can be cheaper, these freelance service providers may not have the necessary licensing or insurance coverage.

FAQ about moving in Boston

What’s full-service moving?

Full-service moving is when your movers handle every part of the moving process for you. They provide packing supplies, provide packing services for your belongings, transport them and unpack them.

Standard moving services are cheaper than full-service moving, as they typically only include loading and moving your belongings. However, full-service moving can be worth it when you factor in the time, labor and packing supplies you'll save. Additionally, full-service moving may offer better insurance coverage compared to self-packed items, which are typically only insured up to 60 cents per dollar. Getting a damage claim approved for self-packed items can also be challenging.

How do you know a mover is licensed?

All legitimate moving companies will show proof of registration on their fleet vehicles, as well as on paperwork like estimates and agreements. If you're planning an interstate move, check the company's USDOT and MC numbers on the official FMCSA website. Moving companies in Massachusetts are also required to have a license from the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities.

How does moving insurance work?

Approximate the full worth of your belongings to accurately choose the best insurance policy. Released-value coverage applies to all moves, which insures 60 cents per pound per item. Getting this additional coverage will cost more, but may be worth it if you're moving costly or rare items.

When is the best time of year to move?

The peak moving time is from May to September, creating high demand for moving teams and significantly elevated pricing nationwide for all moves. The inflated summer rates may deter you from a move at that time of year. However, you may want to bypass moving in the winter as well, since Massachusetts' low temperatures and possible snowfall could present a challenge to your move.

We recommend moving in the spring or early fall seasons when you can expect more favorable weather and lower costs.

What things should I leave to the movers, and what should I transport myself?

For peace of mind, move items like identification documents, financial records and photo albums in your own car. Similarly, load up your vehicle with any high-end electronics that you wouldn't want lost or damaged.

Moving companies frequently restrict insurance coverage on expensive goods, like jewelry and heirlooms. Carry irreplaceable and valuable possessions in your own car if you're worried about loss or damage.

There are certain goods and items prohibited for transportation by moving companies. These include the following:

Perishable foods and produce

Aerosols

Toxic chemicals or cleaners

Batteries

Flammable chemicals of any kind

Plants

Fertilizers

Fuel sources

Compressed tanks or gas

0ac98a6e35,The Globe and Mail,Why does the heat in my older BMW stop working on longer drives? - The Globe and Mail,"Lou,

I drive a 2002 BMW 325CI - I have had this vehicle since 2007 and treat it with the respect it deserves. It remains in near mint condition and with only 164,000 kilometres on the engine. I look forward to many more years of driving pleasure. However, a number of years ago during a winter drive to visit my sister about five hours away, the heater started to provide only cold air. This occurred after about 45 minutes on the highway - the ride back home was rather chilly indeed.

This happened again before I took the car into my local BMW dealer to get to the bottom of the problem. On this occasion and a second occasion as well, they could not find anything wrong with the heating system. I don’t drive the car much in the winter, but trips around my city are fine as the heater works as it is supposed to. On the other hand, I have not taken it on winter highway trips for a couple of years now. Do I have to take a dealer technician on a long drive to ‘prove’ the problem exists? Any advice you can offer will be greatly appreciated. - Bob D.

While it may be obvious to many of you reading this is, there are also many not familiar as to where the heat in your non-electric vehicle originates from. The engine produces a lot of heat and requires coolant to facilitate removal of that heat via the radiator. A small portion of the engine’s coolant is routed into your dash where another small radiator known as a heater core also provides a heat exchange into the cabin, warming the occupants.

Firstly, the coolant temperature needs to be verified. An engine thermostat can sometimes randomly get stuck wide open. When this happens, the coolant will be constantly routed to the radiator, subsequently removing too much heat from the coolant and the engine will run cold. If the engine is running cold, then your heat inside the cabin will also cool down, especially noticeable on longer highway drives. The next time you go for a drive, note specifically where your temperature gauge needle regularly points too. When this lack of heat situation occurs next, check to see if the gauge is showing a lower-than-normal reading which would indicate your engine is running cold.

Secondly, your BMW uses an electronic heater control valve. This is a control flow valve that will open and close a small coolant passageway feeding the heater core. If the electronic portion of the heater control valve fails to do its job, then no hot coolant will be routed into the dash. No hot coolant means no interior heat. Shutting the car off and restarting it will sometimes reset this flow valve and it will once again start working normally. These valves are commonly known to fail intermittently on many BMWs from that generation. If I had to guess, I would say examining this flow control valve presents the most likely chance of sorting out your issue.

848136d562,Reuters,Dissident or fraud? Exiled Chinese businessman Guo's trial nears close - Reuters,"NEW YORK, July 10 (Reuters) - The fraud trial of Guo Wengui neared its end on Wednesday, as a prosecutor told jurors the exiled Chinese businessman duped his followers into providing millions of dollars he spent on luxuries, while a defense lawyer called Guo a misunderstood critic of China's communist government.

In his closing argument at Guo's trial in Manhattan federal court, prosecutor Ryan Finkel said Guo raised more than $1 billion by guaranteeing followers on social media that they would not lose money if they joined him in a series of investment and cryptocurrency schemes from 2018 to 2023.

Finkel played videos of Guo pitching investments, including one where Guo wore sunglasses and stood on the deck of a yacht.

""It was him, this man, who spouted devious lies to trick his followers into giving him money,"" Finkel said, pointing at the defendant. ""They forked over their money to participate in these quote unquote investment opportunities.""

Guo's lawyer Sidhardha Kamaraju began his closing argument by saying that flaunting wealth was part of his client's political critique of the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and that jurors shouldn't rush to judgment as prosecutors had.

""The goal of making investors rich was also a way to spit in the eyes of the CCP,"" Kamaraju said. ""He's trying to tell people that they can have a better life without the CCP. That they can have nice things.""

Guo has pleaded not guilty to 12 criminal counts, including racketeering, in a trial that has lasted seven weeks.

Finkel acknowledged that Guo, a former real estate developer who left China in 2014 during an anti-corruption crackdown, has been targeted by Chinese authorities, but said that had nothing to do with his alleged criminal conduct.

Earlier in the trial, jurors held keys to a red Lamborghini that Finkel said U.S. agents found in the garage of Guo's Connecticut estate.

""Was Miles Guo targeted by the CCP? Yes,"" Finkel said, using one of Guo's aliases. ""Does that excuse what he did? No.""

Guo's aliases have also included Miles Kwok and Ho Wan Kwok.

Jailed since his March 2023 arrest, Guo wore a light gray suit and smiled occasionally during Finkel's argument.

Finkel also showed jurors a video of former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon promoting one of Guo's ventures at a press conference in 2018.

Guo paid Bannon $1 million as part of a consulting contract designed to lend legitimacy to his anti-CCP movement, Finkel said.

Bannon is not accused of wrongdoing in Guo's case, but was arrested on Guo's $37 million yacht, the Lady May, in 2020 in a separate fraud case. Former U.S. President Donald Trump pardoned Bannon in 2021 shortly before leaving the White House.

Bannon is currently serving a four-month jail sentence after he was convicted on separate charges for defying a congressional subpoena.

Kamaraju's closing argument will resume on Thursday.

fa88f9a8d9,Global News Toronto,"Calgary mayor lauds work of residents, city during ‘horrible’ water crisis - Global News Toronto","Mayor Jyoti Gondek has faced a barrage of criticism as she guided Calgary through a water main break that forced city residents and businesses to limit their water use for over a month.

While the mayor says the experience has given her a deep appreciation of partnerships with everyone from the provincial government to the private sector, she said she believes Calgarians have learned something too — the true value of what comes out of their taps.

“As horrible as it was for our city and region to deal with, I think it really shone a light on the fact that we have amazing human beings in this city and this region,” she said in an interview.

Gondek said she hears people talking about how their habits have changed to better conserve water and that they’re just happy their water is back on.

“I hear much, much more of that than the negativity, and that’s what keeps me going.”

It all began June 5, after a massive water main supplying 60 per cent of the drinking water for the city ruptured and flooded streets.

A directive was issued to have Calgarians cut their indoor water use by 25 per cent with fewer showers and toilet flushes. Car washes and indoor pools were also closed.

Crews scrambled to repair the line and, in the process, found five more weak spots to fix, and the city declared a state of local emergency.

Following lengthy repairs, most restrictions have been lifted in the past week.

Just ahead of July’s Calgary Stampede, the city lifted its state of emergency and gave residents the green light to ease back into normal indoor water usage.

Gondek announced more relief Saturday in the form of fewer outdoor water restrictions — including the reopening of outdoor public pools.

A ban on outdoor watering remained in place Saturday, with the system running at reduced capacity to keep enough water in reserve to fight fires and for the replacement line to undergo tests.

Gondek has apologized for communication flubs in the first few days following the infrastructure failure.

“The word catastrophic has not been used lightly to describe what happened here,” said Gondek.

“It was one of those things where people couldn’t see it, and so if they couldn’t see what was wrong, it was hard for them to comprehend that all of us needed to save water.”

Officials couldn’t say Saturday when exactly all the restrictions would be lifted, and Gondek isn’t celebrating yet.

She reiterated that even though the water main has been fixed, the city’s system still needs time to get back to full capacity.

As council plans to appoint an independent panel to investigate how and why the water main ruptured, Gondek said the post-mortem probably won’t assuage her most vocal detractors.

“The folks that are angry, and think it was a conspiracy — I don’t know that anything is going to satisfy them,” she said.

“So what you have to do is keep your head down and do the work and keep your chin up and know that there are very good people in this world who took up the call to action and did a great job in saving water.”

Gondek has praised Alberta Premier Danielle Smith for offering to help the city at the outset of the crisis.

She’s lauded Calgary Stampede organizers for trucking water in for the event and the private sector for its help in fixing the pipe.

She has noted that Calgarians managed to cut their water usage by 25 per cent.

The crisis is the latest challenge in a mayoral tenure that has been marked at times by extreme opposition, from an organized effort to recall her from office to the backlash against city council’s blanket rezoning effort to densify housing.

Recent polls suggest her popularity continues to sink.

Gondek stands by the work of city administration and government and the importance of demonstrating that the community can come together.

“We don’t always get it right, but we are open to listening to the public and we are moving forward,” she said, adding it is more difficult now than when she was first elected as a councillor in 2017 to have a rational, civil public conversation.

“Everything changed during the pandemic, and the conspiracies and the negativity and the polarization and the vitriol escalated, and it’s at a very dangerous level right now.”

Gondek said she copes with the job in part by getting on her rowing machine early in the morning, when she can, and soaking up the morning news.

“I don’t believe in this principle of water off a duck’s back. You have to feel things in the moment, because once you stop feeling, you’re not going to be serving the public properly,” she said.

“I also have the ability to bounce away from that and say ‘All right, now it’s time to go do this instead.’”","A woman stands at a podium with a microphone, addressing an audience.

1423278c66,Financial Times,UK media watchdog starts hiring spree amid pressure to curb misinformation - Financial Times,"Ofcom is increasing hiring for its online safety workforce as concerns rise that the regulator lacks sufficient powers to curb the kinds of misinformation that sparked recent violent unrest in the UK.

The media regulator told the Financial Times it had more than 460 people working on the Online Safety Act, with plans to expand by 20 per cent to more than 550 by next March. This would equate to a third of Ofcom’s 1,500 total staff.

The hiring spree comes amid a wider debate in the wake of violent unrest across the country this month over whether the government can effectively tackle the rise of false information online.

The riots were initially sparked by a mass stabbing in Southport on July 29, in which three girls were killed and eight other children and two adults were injured. Violence was stoked by the sharing of misinformation and disinformation on social media platforms following the attack.

X owner Elon Musk’s recent posts, including references to UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer’s “two-tier policing” and a retweet by the founder of the far-right English Defence League Tommy Robinson, have highlighted concerns over the state’s power to hold the tech billionaire to account.

The UK’s Online Safety Act was passed last year, but will not come into full effect until late 2025 or 2026.

The legislation contains one provision for dealing with disinformation, making it illegal to send a message that contains information that an individual knows to be false with the intention of causing “non-trivial psychological or physical harm to a likely audience”.

Beyond this, the act will also oblige companies to adhere to their own terms of service that are currently being drafted.

“If you’re more free speech inclined, you might not put ‘cracking down on the spreading of misinformation’ in your terms of services,” said one person involved in drafting the legislation.

Several politicians, lawyers, and lawmakers argue the Online Safety Act in its current form does not go far enough to hold tech companies and their executives to account for allowing false truths to proliferate on their platforms.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan argued in the wake of the riots that it was “not fit for purpose”, while Starmer indicated he would look at ways to “toughen up” the legislation.

“Even when enforced, the Online Safety Act would likely account for a fraction of the problems that happened online before and during the violence,” said Josh Simons, new Labour MP for Makerfield who used to work on responsible artificial intelligence at Meta.

“If we think it’s toxic and corrosive of our public sphere to have lies circulating at speed, we need to have the public interest in the minds of the people building those algorithms,” he added.

Simons, who was head of the Labour-affiliated think-tank Labour Together until last month, is among a number of lawyers and policymakers who believe the government should develop a new law to tackle the algorithms that help spread misinformation.

Others argue that extending the legislation could create excessive responsibilities for the regulator, which is already battling to define the rules that govern offences in the act.

Ofcom is concerned about ensuring efforts to hold tech companies to account, by issuing fines under the act, are watertight. The regulator expects penalties to face legal challenges from some of the richest and most powerful groups.

Losing cases can be financially and reputationally damaging. Last week, the German government suffered a blow when the courts overturned its decision to ban the far-right magazine Compact.

The decision was seen as a gift to the nationalist periodical, which boasted of a “victory of David over Goliath” and increased readership on the back of the ruling.

One lawyer who asked to remain anonymous said they could not imagine a regulator “better equipped to implement this law” than Ofcom, given its expertise and manpower. But they said they believed the regulator had been given an “impossible task”.

They added that extending the legislation to include misinformation, “the more risk there would be of arbitrary decisions being made” by governments and platforms who are being asked to become “arbiters of the truth”.

Ministers have this month looked at bringing in powers to force internet companies to remove “legal but harmful” content, originally part of the Online Safety Act that was removed after months of wrangling and pushback from free speech proponents.

Many experts are sceptical that reintroducing the clause will solve the problem given it could add to Ofcom’s responsibilities, forcing the regulator to weigh in on the complex question of what is deemed “harmful”.","A group of people holding signs with 'TWO TIER KEIR' and 'TWO TIER KEIR' written on them, with one sign having a red cross symbol.

636f3570a0,Financial Times,Macquarie’s competing energy ambitions on display at AGM - Financial Times,"Good morning and welcome back to Energy Source, coming to you from New York, where fears of a US recession prompted a sharp sell-off in stocks and other risky assets.

Commodity markets have not escaped the turmoil as investors fret that demand for oil, gas and metals critical to the energy transition will fall if the US economy falters.

Oil prices are hovering close to six-month lows and traders say they would have fallen further if it were not for fears that rising tensions in the Middle East could interrupt supplies. You can read more here and here.

Elsewhere, my Energy Source colleague Malcolm Moore and I have published a deep dive on the bitter dispute between the oil and gas industry and the International Energy Agency over the future of fossil fuels.

Fatih Birol, the 66-year-old head of the IEA, has asked Big Oil to “look at their business plans” given the urgent need to slash carbon emissions and tackle global warming. The industry has responded by accusing the agency of playing climate politics and publishing biased research.

The squabble has captured the attention of senior Republican politicians in the US and former officials in Donald Trump’s administration, who are threatening to oust Birol and stop funding the IEA.

Our main item today takes us to Australia, where Macquarie, the Sydney-based asset manager, is facing questions from investors over its green credentials, as it continues to profit from oil and gas.

Thanks for reading, and drop me a line at jamie.smyth@ft.com.

Macquarie’s energy goals clash at AGM

Macquarie, the Sydney-based asset manager and bank, has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of volatility in the global energy markets. Price swings and uncertainty generated by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and extreme weather conditions produced outsized profits for its commodities trading business and similarly huge bonuses for its executives.

Energy has remained a central topic within the company’s more traditional asset management and investment banking arms given its bets on long-term cyclical trends around the energy transition. Macquarie, which bought the UK’s Green Investment Bank in 2017, has invested in renewable projects including sustainable aviation fuel and green hydrogen generation.

In the company’s market update last month, which coincided with its annual shareholder meeting, Macquarie pushed back the potential sale of various assets in renewable energy to the second half of the year. But it stuck to its guns on the opportunity that the energy transition presents investors and others looking to finance major projects.

Glenn Stevens, chair of Macquarie and a former Reserve Bank of Australia governor, told shareholders that the investor had 110 gigawatts of clean energy infrastructure at various stages of development, more than double that of the overall Australian market.

“The transition that is in progress to shift from hydrocarbon fuels to non-carbon fuels is easily the biggest re-engineering of the modern economy that we live in since the industrial revolution. It is a huge undertaking. It will take many years. It will take a tremendous amount of investment and a lot of capital is going to need to be committed to it,” he said.

Yet Macquarie, like many companies providing finance in the energy sector, is caught between a rock and a hard place. It is championing the renewables revolution, despite growing questions over whether its ambitious climate targets can be achieved. But it has yet to completely abandon its support for the oil and gas sector, which has attracted the brickbats of climate groups.

One shareholder at the annual meeting was quick to ask why Macquarie was still investing in new fossil fuel projects. The asset in question was Empire Energy, which is well advanced with a plan to start fracking in the remote Beetaloo Basin in Australia’s vast Northern Territory. Macquarie owns a 2.6 per cent stake in the business, whose chief executive Alex Underwood is a former director of Macquarie’s energy markets division.

The temptation may have been to shrug off the question but Stevens hit back and said it was important that institutions such as Macquarie continue to support oil and gas companies to help them decarbonise on the journey towards net zero. “There will be many twists and turns on this journey. Our view also is that some of the carbon-based fuels, particularly gas, are going to remain a part of the energy mix for quite some time as a transition fuel. It is unrealistic actually to think otherwise,” he said pointedly.

Underwood told Energy Source that Macquarie’s support had been “fantastic” as his company pushes on towards producing gas in the Beetaloo Basin within the next 12 months. He cited a recent strategy statement from the Australian government that gas would continue to play a part in the country’s energy system, and that of its Asian neighbours, as providing support for Macquarie’s position.

Back at the AGM, another Macquarie investor, sitting behind Energy Source, greeted a second question on Empire with a sigh and turned to the person next to him and said under his breath, “drill, baby, drill”. (Nic Fildes)

38a7047691,CNN,"Trump rails against vulnerable Sen. Jon Tester, Harris and Walz in Montana - CNN","Former President Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail Friday in Montana, where he railed against vulnerable Sen. Jon Tester, briefly talked up the Democrat’s GOP challenger and then unleashed another dizzying series of attacks on the Democratic presidential ticket.

The rally in Bozeman was Trump’s first since Vice President Kamala Harris officially secured the Democratic nomination and selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate, two moves that have energized Democrats and, if only for a few days, knocked the former president out of the headlines.

Big Sky Country is expected to break overwhelmingly for Trump in November, but the Senate race is on track to be much closer – and could swing the balance of power in the chamber.

“We need the Senate,” Trump told the crowd Friday, stressing the critical nature of the contest here. “We need the Senate.”

As president in 2018, Trump stumped hard for then-state Auditor Matt Rosendale, visiting the state four times during that midterm cycle. Rosendale, now a congressman, lost to Tester by about 3 points.

Tester’s opponent this year – Republican Tim Sheehy, a retired Navy SEAL and aerospace CEO – appeared alongside Trump at the event but was hardly the honored guest. Trump has for years been at odds with Tester, the top Democrat on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, over the senator’s role in sinking the nomination of former White House doctor Ronny Jackson to run the Veterans Affairs Department.

Jackson, now a congressman from Texas, traveled to Bozeman to deliver his own indictment of Tester, who, in 2018, helped compile a report detailing a slew of allegations – including abusive behavior, loosely handling prescription drugs and being intoxicated on the job – that eventually caused Jackson to withdraw from consideration.

“He decided that it was in his political best interest and would help his (reelection campaign) if he could come out and be the guy who tore down one of Donald Trump’s Cabinet nominees,” an agitated Jackson told the crowd. “He tried to destroy me.”

New Democratic ticket

Trump’s visit to Montana came on the heels of a busy week for Harris, who officially selected Walz as her vice presidential pick on Tuesday before the two struck out on a campaign tour of battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Arizona. In addition to his typical attack lines, Trump also brought audio-visual aids on this occasion, twice stopping his speech to play video mash-ups of Harris either misspeaking or embracing a liberal cause.

Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, has closely mirrored the Harris-Walz campaign’s schedule over the past few days, visiting many of the same states in what he said was an effort to heighten the contrast between the dueling tickets.

Trump on Friday acknowledged Vance’s difficulties during his first few weeks as the Republican vice presidential nominee. Calling his new running mate “really special,” Trump recalled telling Vance, “You got your sea legs” after taking some early shots.

The former president was less complimentary of Walz, calling him “very freakish” while previewing further lines of attack.

If Harris and Walz win the election, Trump said, “the people cheering will be the pink-haired Marxists, the looters, the perverts, the flag burners, Hamas supporters, drug dealers, gun-grabbers and human traffickers.”

That riff, and others like it, were part of a broad, though scattered, attempt to paint the Democratic ticket as too liberal.

“But I’m not talking about him, I’m talking about her,” Trump added, referring to Harris. “This is her ideology. That’s why she picked him.”

Trump made only passing reference to his campaign’s recent attacks about Walz’s military service, which have mostly been deployed by Vance, who served in the Marine Corps.

“His really is valor,” Trump said of Sheehy, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, among other deployments. “It’s valor for heroism award, you know. The other one talks about valor. He has a different kind of a valor. It’s the opposite.”

Vance has accused Walz of “stolen valor” for language he used in a 2018 speech advocating an assault weapons ban, which the Harris campaign has included in a video on social media. Walz at the time said he wanted to “make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at.” Walz never deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq or a combat zone as part of his service.

The Bozeman rally also marked Trump’s first foray outside Florida this week. On Thursday, he held a roughly hourlong news conference with reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida during which he attempted to recapture the spotlight from his Democratic rival.

Trump used the attention to toss a familiar laundry list of attacks against Harris, Walz and Democrats more broadly. The former president repeatedly insulted Harris’ intelligence and needled her for not yet holding a news conference of her own, described Walz as a left-wing radical in disguise and, once more, insisted that Jewish voters who support Democrats “should have their heads examined.”

On Friday, Trump again attacked the vice president’s intelligence and mocked her for not doing an interview or holding a news conference since becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee.

He falsely claimed that Harris is “refusing to debate” him. Harris and Trump have both agreed to a debate hosted by ABC on September 10, and Harris told reporters she would be “happy” to discuss another debate.

Trump also said Friday that he didn’t care if he mispronounced Harris’ name and claimed without elaborating that “nobody really knows her last name.”

“Kamala, sometimes referred to as Kamala, you know, she’s got about nine different ways of pronouncing the name,” Trump said. “And because the press is so dishonest, no matter how you say it, they’ll say you were wrong. You were wrong. I don’t care if I get it right. Actually, I couldn’t care less.”

New phase of campaign

The past week has thrust the 2024 campaign into a new phase, with the major-party tickets now, finally, firmly in place ahead of the election and the candidates ratcheting up their rhetoric.

Harris and Walz have used their battleground state swing this week to paint the election as a choice between a prosecutor and a convicted felon, as well as a “normal” ticket, theirs, and the “weird” pairing of Trump and Vance.

Trump’s running mate, meanwhile, used his travels to attack Harris’ record on crime, inflation and the border, while also doubling down on the former president’s false claims about her heritage, labeling her “a chameleon” who “pretends to be something different depending on which audience she’s speaking to.”

Vance also escalated his attacks on Walz, accusing the Minnesota governor of ducking service in Iraq when he left the Army National Guard in 2005 to run for Congress. Walz retired two months before his unit received alert orders to deploy to Iraq.

Those clashes mostly took a backseat on Friday night to what’s expected to be an ultra-competitive Senate race. Tester, who was first elected in 2006, is the last-remaining Democrat in nonjudicial statewide office in Montana.

Sheehy, meanwhile, has won the support of both Trump and his allies and the GOP establishment, which views the seat as key to winning a Senate majority going into 2025.

Montana Sen. Steve Daines, the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the first member of his party’s leadership to back Trump’s 2024 bid, was an early Sheehy supporter and helped convince the former president to get behind him.

Speaking to reporters before the rally, Daines said that he personally encouraged Trump to visit his home state, despite it not being a presidential battleground, because he believes Montana will be the state that delivers Republicans the Senate majority come November.

“You can imagine if President Trump had to call Chuck Schumer and try to figure out how to get his nominees through,” Daines said. “So that’s why Montana becomes very important, because this becomes the 51st seat.”

The Montana contest is one of just two Senate campaigns in which a Democratic incumbent is seeking reelection in a state Trump twice carried. Sen. Sherrod Brown’s campaign in Ohio is the other. But unlike in Ohio, Montana Republicans quickly coalesced around Sheehy, avoiding a tempestuous primary.

Sensing the stakes, both parties have poured money into the contest, spending tens of millions on early advertising and booking airtime in the coming fall months, making it the second-most expensive Senate race of the cycle so far.

eb8ed2ca01,The Economist,Want to stop a third world war? Pick up the phone - The Economist,"ON COMING to power Jim Hacker, the protagonist of “Yes, Prime Minister”, a British comedy series, asks about the hotline to the Kremlin. It works only “theoretically”, he is told; once they reached a switchboard operator who “didn’t seem to speak much English”. What’s more, using it “tends to create unnecessary panic at the other end”.

The farce springs to mind for those who, these days, urgently try to speak to China about security frictions in Asia, from its “grey-zone” bullying of neighbours over disputed islands and shoals to its wargames around Taiwan. The Philippines has a hotline to China’s foreign ministry. But when it calls to discuss China’s water-blasting of its coastguard ships, the Chinese either do not answer, or say the hotline is not for “complaints”, or accuse the Filipinos of causing trouble. Japan’s defence-ministry hotline has not stopped intensified Chinese probing of contested waters.

America, especially, wants military-to-military (“mil-mil”) communications with China, akin to those of the cold war with the Soviet Union. At a time of deep geopolitical rivalry, with the air and seas in Asia abuzz with military forces, America says open lines of communication would help prevent incidents from sliding into war. China, though, regards military contacts not as prudence but as a favour: granted in times of goodwill and withheld in periods of displeasure.

Mil-mil contacts were halted after a visit to Taiwan by Nancy Pelosi, then Speaker of America’s House of Representatives, in 2022. Chinese jets and warships harassed American ones with risky moves. Now tensions have eased a bit following a summit in San Francisco last November between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping, the American and Chinese presidents. Unsafe encounters are much reduced. Mil-mil meetings are resuming.

That will be a relief for Asia’s defence bigwigs at this week’s Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual talkfest in Singapore. They don’t want to be caught in a war between China, their main economic partner, and America, the security guarantor for many. Last year Lloyd Austin, America’s defence secretary, could merely shake hands with his Chinese counterpart, General Li Shangfu, over dinner. Little matter; General Li was soon purged.

This time Mr Austin is set for a full bilateral with the new man, Admiral Dong Jun. They spoke over video in April. Similarly, America’s chairman of the joint chiefs of staff has had a video call with his opposite number. The Military Maritime Consultative Agreement, a forum on safety at sea, has also resumed.

Nevertheless, any military contact will be halting. For one thing, notes Rush Doshi, until recently a White House official, worsening relations between the mainland and Taiwan could strain mil-mil contacts when they matter most. China recently held two days of “punishment” military exercises, encircling the island, after the inauguration of Taiwan’s new president, Lai Ching-te.

Moreover, the main warfighters—the heads of America’s Indo-Pacific Command and of China’s eastern and southern theatres—have yet to talk. And in China’s hierarchical system, notes Mr Doshi, many of China’s brass will shrink from contact with Americans, fearing it “can only bring trouble”. Pentagon officials assume that “the Chinese will go dark” in the early phase of any crisis. Nevertheless, Americans still think talking is better than not talking; nuances in formulaic Chinese remarks can still yield insights.

For a sense of the dangers, consider the back and forth between American forces and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) as Robin Hsu, a military enthusiast, does from a hilltop in southern Taiwan. Overlooking the vital Bashi Channel, his radio comes alive with a stentorian warning from the PLA to an American jet—probably a “Rivet Joint” surveillance plane nearby: “You have entered airspace over China’s contiguous zone.” Back comes a drawl: “Relaaaaaax! I’m in international airspace.” Minutes later, another warning: “This is Chinese naval warship. You are approaching me. What is your intention?” Plainly, relations are far from relaxed.

Indeed, China uses such risk to warn America: if you don’t want a mishap, pull back. America, by contrast, learned during the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 that risk must be mitigated because superpower confrontations can escalate to nuclear war. All of which prompts some at the Pentagon to ask: does another Cuban missile crisis have to happen before China comes to its senses? ■","An illustration of a woman in a blue shirt with a red bandana, holding a paper with 'CHOICE' written on it, and a tattoo on her arm that says 'LOUD'.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=168x224 at 0x7D6BDA72DE70>,2024-05-30 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.economist.com,https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/05/30/want-to-stop-a-third-world-war-pick-up-the-phone,['International' 'Politics'],[0.9 0.8],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/eb8ed2ca01.png
16719facfd,Fox News,"Turkey and Greece leaders to meet, put friendship initiative to the test amid Gaza and Ukraine wars - Fox News","Old foes Turkey and Greece will test a five-month-old friendship initiative Monday when Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis visits Ankara.

The two NATO members, which share decades of mutual animosity, a tense border and disputed waters, agreed to sideline disputes last December. Instead, they’re focusing on trade and energy, repairing cultural ties and a long list of other items placed on the so-called positive agenda.

Here’s a look at what the two sides hope to achieve and the disputes that have plagued ties in the past:

NEW YORK MUSEUM CURATOR DETAINED IN TURKEY FOR ALLEGED SPIDER SMUGGLING CLAIMS TO HAVE GOVERNMENT PERMITS

FOCUSING ON A POSITIVE AGENDA

Mitsotakis is to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara on Monday as part of efforts to improve ties following the solidarity Athens showed Ankara after a devastating earthquake hit southern Turkey last year.

The two leaders have sharp differences over the Israeli-Hamas war, but are keen to hold back further instability in the eastern Mediterranean as conflict also continues to rage in Ukraine.

""We always approach our discussions with Turkey with confidence and with no illusions that Turkish positions will not change from one moment to the next,"" Mitsotakis said last week, commenting on the visit. ""Nevertheless, I think it’s imperative that when we disagree, the channels of communication should always be open.""

""We should disagree without tension and without this always causing an escalation on the ground,"" he added.

Ioannis Grigoriadis, a professor of political science at Ankara’s Bilkent University, said the two leaders would look for ways ""to expand the positive agenda and look for topics where the two sides can seek win-win solutions,"" such as in trade, tourism and migration.

EASY VISAS FOR TURKISH TOURISTS

Erdogan visited Athens in early December, and the two countries have since maintained regular high-level contacts to promote a variety of fence-mending initiatives, including educational exchanges and tourism.

Turkish citizens this summer are able to visit 10 Greek islands using on-the-spot visas, skipping a more cumbersome procedure needed to enter Europe’s common travel area zone, known as the Schengen area.

""This generates a great opportunity for improving the economic relations between the two sides, but also to bring the two stable societies closer — for Greeks and Turks to realize that they have more things in common than they think,"" Grigoriadis said.

A HISTORY OF DISPUTES

Disagreements have brought Athens and Ankara close to war on several occasions over the past five decades, mostly over maritime borders and the rights to explore for resources in the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean seas.

The two countries are also locked in a dispute over Cyprus, which was divided in 1974 when Turkey invaded following a coup by supporters of union with Greece. Only Turkey recognizes a Turkish Cypriot declaration of independence in the island’s northern third.

The dispute over the exploration of energy resources resulted in a naval standoff in 2020 and a vow by Erdogan to halt talks with the Mitsotakis government. But the two men met three times last year following a thaw in relations and a broader effort by Erdogan to re-engage with Western countries.

The foreign ministers of the two countries, Hakan Fidan of Turkey and George Gerapetritis of Greece, are set to join the talks Monday and hold a separate meeting.

RECENT DISAGREEMENTS

Just weeks before Mitsotakis’ visit, Erdogan announced the opening of a former Byzantine-era church in Istanbul as a mosque, drawing criticism from Greece and the Greek Orthodox church. Like Istanbul’s landmark Hagia Sophia, the Chora had operated as a museum for decades before it was converted into a mosque.

Turkey, meanwhile, has criticized recently announced plans by Greece to declare areas in the Ionian and Aegean seas as ""marine parks"" to conserve aquatic life. Turkey objects to the one-sided declaration in the Aegean, where some areas remain under dispute, and has labelled the move as ""a step that sabotages the normalization process.""",Two men shaking hands in front of a building with a dog and soldiers in the background.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BCAD22830>,2024-05-13 18:05:15+00:00,https://www.foxnews.com,https://www.foxnews.com/world/turkey-greece-leaders-meet-friendship-initiative-test-gaza-ukraine-wars,['International' 'Politics'],[0.9 0.8],Unlikely,Likely,sample_review/images/16719facfd.png
1816939bbc,The New York Times,Modi Will Feel the Heat in a Third Term. And Not Just Politically. - The New York Times,"India, the world’s most populous country, is also among the most vulnerable to climate hazards. That’s not only because of the heat and floods that global warming has exacerbated, but also because so many of the country’s 1.4 billion people are vulnerable to begin with. Most people are poor, by global standards, and they have no safety net.

Narendra Modi, the Hindu nationalist prime minister who claimed victory Tuesday for a third five-year term, will face major challenges fueled by climate change.

Heat is now an election issue, literally.

The six-week process of voting took place amid a scorching heat wave in several parts of the country. In the northern states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, at least 33 people, including poll workers, died of complications from the heat last week, according to government authorities cited by Reuters.

Rohit Magotra, deputy director of Integrated Research and Action for Development, called on national election officials to reschedule elections in the future to avoid such calamities. He pointed out that workers from every political party suffer in the heat, and so do voters, who often have to line up under the sun.

“I definitely see the momentum building up, and elections are unlikely to be scheduled in peak summer in future,” said Mr. Magotra, whose organization has advocated heat solutions in Indian cities.

The Election Commission this year did set up a task force to monitor weather conditions, but only after voting got underway amid abnormally high temperatures. It also sent election workers a list of heat precautions prepared by the National Disaster Management Agency. However, according to a report published in Scroll, an Indian news site, political-party campaigners were not told to do anything differently because of the heat.

While parliamentary elections are traditionally scheduled in summer in India, climate change is making summers increasingly dangerous. This year, one weather station in Delhi broke the all-time temperature record with a reading above 52 degrees Celsius (127 degrees Fahrenheit) in late May. It was the third consecutive year of abnormally high temperatures in India, all made worse by climate change, according to scientific studies of the heat waves.

Several cities and states have heat action plans, at least on paper. But as one independent analysis concluded last year, they are mostly underfunded and lack concrete ways to identify and protect the most vulnerable.

Farmers, politically powerful, are angry.

Mr. Modi’s government has faced some of the most potent opposition in recent years from farmers’ organizations. And many of their concerns are rooted in climate issues.

In 2020, hundreds of thousands of farmers, mostly from India’s breadbasket region of Punjab and Haryana, erected encampments outside of New Delhi and rolled their tractors into the capital in protests that turned violent. Their initial grievance was over Mr. Modi’s efforts to open up more private investment in agriculture, which the farmers said would make them vulnerable to low prices driven by corporate profit motives.

In the face of the uprising, the government backed down, a rarity for Mr. Modi, but also a move that signals the seriousness with which his administration took the protests.

Again this year, farmers marched on the capital, this time demanding higher government-set prices for wheat and rice.

The global image of India is often associated with its fast-growing economy, its vibrant cities and its huge, young work force. But a majority of its people still depend on farm incomes, most of its 770 million poor people live in the countryside, and the government has been unable to create anywhere near the number of jobs outside agriculture that its booming youth population demands. Fixing agriculture in the era of climate change is likely to be among Mr. Modi’s most profound challenges in the coming years.

“Definitely, increasing extreme weather events (floods, heat waves, storms) are the most important climate challenge facing the government,” said M. Rajeevan, a former secretary in the Earth Sciences Ministry who is now vice chancellor at Atria University in Bengaluru.

Then there’s India’s coal habit.

That’s driven by both political and economic considerations. Coal is the incumbent fuel. Public and private companies, many of them politically connected, are invested in coal. The government’s main interest is in keeping electricity prices low.

Coal remains the country’s biggest source of electricity. Coal use grew this year, partly driven by climate change itself.

Higher temperatures drive up demand for air-conditioners and fans, which drives up demand for electricity. India’s power-sector emissions soared in the first quarter of 2024, according to Ember, a research organization that tracks emissions.

Coal provides more than 70 percent of India’s electricity, with solar and wind accounting for a little more than 10 percent. And even though the government has set an ambitious target of 500 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2030, coal’s influence is unlikely to dim anytime soon. According to government projections, coal will still supply more than half of India’s electricity in 2030.","A person in a green shirt is seen digging in a field with a shovel, with other individuals in the background, some sitting and one standing.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x117 at 0x7D6BA49607C0>,2024-06-04 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/climate/modi-climate-india-election.html,['Politics' 'Weather and Environment'],[0.85 0.8 ],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/1816939bbc.png
f14b0b2c27,Reuters,"In France, three-way election battles could bring more far-right MPs - Reuters","MAGNY-EN-VEXIN, France, July 5 (Reuters) - On the campaign trail in Magny-en-Vexin, French centrist candidate Emilie Chandler is determined to maintain her bid in a three-way race for her parliamentary constituency, even if it risks raising the odds of a far-right win locally.

Chandler's constituency in this scenic part of the Val d'Oise, an hour's drive northwest of Paris, is one of the roughly 100 three-way election battles the far-right National Rally (RN) will need to win if it is to have a chance of securing an absolute majority in Sunday's election.

France's electoral system allows any candidate whose first-round vote amounts to 12.5% of registered voters to proceed to the decisive second round. Historically, a more fragmented second round has benefited the far right.

Chandler's chances of victory are slim, having polled third with 25% of cast votes in the first round, behind rivals from the far right and the left-wing New Popular Front (NPF). But she nonetheless defends her decision.

""I didn't want to abandon my electorate,"" said Chandler, who is running on French President Emmanuel Macron's Together alliance ticket.

""I wouldn't have done it without the consent of the prime minister's office. It's because I'm in a very specific situation, with dangerous opponents.""

Nationwide, the first round had originally left three-way contests in about 300 of the races for the National Assembly's 577 seats. In the past days, more than 200 third-placed candidates have withdrawn their candidacy in an attempt to block the far right from holding power.

Opinion polls suggest this so-called ""republican front"" may have an impact, now projecting that the RN will win fewer seats than previously thought and likely to be short of an absolute majority. It is still expected to win the largest share of seats in parliament.

Chandler defended her decision by saying her constituents would not give their vote to the NFP's candidate who hails from the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party, perceived as more extreme than other parties in the leftist coalition.

FAR RIGHT: FEAR AND TEMPTATION

But the pill was hard to swallow for local business owner Mourad Elferdi, who voted NFP in the first round and told Reuters he was afraid of what he called the far right's hateful discourse. He said he wished Chandler had withdrawn her candidacy.

""I'm worried about my kids, how do you want me to explain the situation to them,"" said Elferdi. ""It's beyond sad.""

NFP candidate Maximilien Jules-Arthur, a native of the nearby working class town of Sarcelles, described Chandler's decision as ""shameful"".

""When we had to stop the far right, we did. We did it in 2022. We did it in 2017,"" said Jules-Arthur.

""It's really shameful and irresponsible coming from people who accuse us (LFI) of not being republican,"" the 24-year-old said. ""They're giving a free pass to people who are extremely dangerous.""

The far-right candidate, Anne Sicard, who is running on a RN-backed ticket, rejected the idea she espoused dangerous ideas.

""I'm not racist or xenophobic, I just love the culture I was born into,"" she told Reuters by telephone.

Until last month, Sicard was campaigning with the Reconquete party of Eric Zemmour, a former far-right presidential candidate who has been convicted for inciting racial hatred crimes and is renowned for provocative statements on Islam and immigration.

Sicrad said France had hit an unsustainable level of immigration that was causing problems across society. The RN would also defend the budgets of hard-up households.

""The French are suffering from taxes. Purchasing power is what the state leaves you.""

Pensioner Gerard De Dios said he wanted to give the RN a try after voting for Macron's party in the past two elections.

""I want things to change,"" he said, citing insecurity.

Crime was not a problem in his village of 600 people but he no longer dared take the train to Paris, he added.

Three-way races should be maintained to give voters the fullest choice possible, he continued, echoing comments by far-right chief Marine Le Pen that the strategy to withdraw candidates to hinder the far right was an insult to voters' intelligence and their political loyalties.

""You have to let everyone decide for themselves - or change the rules altogether,"" de Dios said.

036bd9c4cc,Financial Times,"Vertigo — fashion, fast cars and life in the Weimar whirlwind - Financial Times","The arbiters of taste had spoken. No more androgynous tubes or practical office suits. German women now wanted to look “feminine, modest and helpless”, maybe assisted by “a little cape, a beret and a muff made of fur”. Lucy von Jacobi issued her sartorial decree in Tempo magazine on January 30 1933. On that day, elsewhere in Berlin, Adolf Hitler became chancellor.

Historians of the Weimar Republic, which Hitler and his National Socialists extinguished within weeks, face a special challenge. The world-shaking cultural trends that make Germany’s trajectory from 1918 to 1933 so dynamic — from film to fashion, shopping to sexuality — all had causes and courses of their own. Big-picture politics alone cannot explain fluctuating hemlines or, say, the revolution in home design that turns any trip to Ikea in 2024 into a consumer tribute (from cutlery to chairs) to the Bauhaus workshops of 1924. Yet the republic’s catastrophic finale casts a heavy backward shadow. Those lurching years of experimental democracy can look in retrospect like (in Harald Jähner’s words) “the pre-history of its conclusion”.

In this energetic and engaging narrative, editor-turned-historian Jähner largely dodges the traps of hindsight. He aims to recreate not how the era looked in retrospect but how it felt at the time, as he did in a previous work about post-Third Reich Germany, Aftermath. Nothing about the totalitarian takeover was preordained: “People had a choice . . . including in the polling booth”. Indeed, the Nazi vote slid just as the state’s reckless patrician elite invited Hitler into office as a “containment strategy”.

Rather than viewing each arena of convulsive change — department stores, dance crazes, motoring, sport, radio — as a prelude to calamity, Jähner follows the turbulent feelings that Weimar’s whirlwind of innovation deposited in its wake. From the liberated ecstasy of chic women in fast cars (a “magical combination”) to the post-1930 “crisis of communication”, when “Germans could no longer hear one another”, Vertigo presents not a chronicle of events but a tapestry of mass emotions.

For history and literature alike, this is well-mapped ground. Readers keen to explore the terrain behind, say, the fiction of Alfred Döblin or the drama of Bertolt Brecht can already consult a historical shelf that stretches from classics such as Eric Weitz’s Weimar Germany to Frank McDonough’s recent The Weimar Years. Jähner’s approach not only carries a heavy cultural spin but puts the politics of collective feeling — from exhilaration to despair — centre stage.

The new-minted freedoms of the 1920s bequeathed models of “self-actualisation” to future generations, from keep-fit regimes and back-to-nature activism to gay nightclubs, but often left the hard-pressed urban crowds behind, prey to “the ill-tempered vocabulary of cultural pessimism”. Political street violence, barely policed, painted a bloody backdrop to almost every scene. Jähner may shun trite comparisons, but the Weimar blend of lofty principles and vicious polemics seems painfully familiar today.

Vertigo draws well on the brilliant reporters and commentators of a time when journalism — as practised by giants such as Kurt Tucholsky or Joseph Roth — enjoyed a “stylistic and perceptive heyday”. In this edition, Jähner benefits hugely from Shaun Whiteside’s swift and agile translation, always alert to the edgy, crackling modernity of Weimar prose.

Keen-eyed, thin-skinned observers showed how politics, economics and technology seeped into German souls, whether the “mindboggling rage” of rightwing Great War veterans “betrayed by their own homeland” or the pivot of agony aunt “Frau Christine” towards “depth, seriousness, authenticity” after the “cheeky, frivolous arrogance” of the 1920s. Even the cosy, conservative waltz came back (Jähner treats dance-floor fads as diagnostic tools) in reaction to the solitary frenzy of shimmy and Charleston, with their “athletic and action-packed” equality.

The Weimar years raced towards no predestined terminus. Still, from hyperinflation in 1923 (when thieves would steal basketfuls of banknotes — and keep the basket) to credit collapse in 1931 and 30 per cent unemployment, successive shocks eroded faith in the institutions of democracy. When the slump hit, flailing centre-ground parties agreed on policies of punitive austerity. In reaction, far left and right would “come together in their hatred of the establishment”.

Amplified by excitable media, feelings of dread and disillusion crystallised into “crosses on ballot papers”. And the National Socialists, that “bizarre agglomeration”, an ill-assorted “party of brawlers and professors”, knew how to twist “an economic depression into a mental crisis” and profit from “overheated hopes of salvation”.

If Jähner shuns hindsight, he also steers clear of drawing simplistic parallels. Warnings for today nonetheless emerge as he tracks the polarisation that left “every milieu” as “an island in itself”, with all connecting bridges burnt. Radical critics railed in now familiar terms against the “mainstream media”, Systempresse. Even the angle of a house roof (flat or pitched?) became fodder for furious culture wars in a public realm “hollowed out . . . by rigorism and self-righteousness; like a lawn by moles”.

By 1933, “the opportunity for argument had gone”. A fake national unity procured by terror and fraud prevailed. Jähner gazes wistfully at the women weavers of the 1920s Bauhaus, with their bobs, slacks and defiant smiles, and notes “how little separates us from them”. If that kinship applies to forward-looking Weimar in its prime, let’s hope we can still unstitch the kind of snarling hatreds that hastened its fall.

cf582df802,Reuters,Looking back: Apple supplier Foxconn among firms asked to cut power use in Vietnam - Reuters,"The request for energy-saving measures, which two other industry sources said was sent to multiple manufacturers, is precautionary and aimed at averting a repeat of last summer when power shortage led to over a billion dollars in lost output.

The request to Foxconn was ""an encouragement"", not a requirement and has not had any impact on production, one of the people said.

The southeast Asian nation relies on foreign investment for economic growth and has been trying to attract energy-intensive industries, such as semiconductor manufacturing.

However, a heat wave last May and June triggered a power shortage that interrupted business in the north, causing $1.4 billion worth of loss, or 0.3% of gross domestic product, World Bank preliminary estimates showed.

In March, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh pledged to foreign investors that power shortages would not happen again.

The government has asked coal-fired power plants to delay maintenance to meet higher electricity demand in the hottest months, one of the people said.

The people did not specify who sent the requests, when the request to Foxconn was sent or for how long the voluntary cut in electricity use would be needed. One person said the request was open-ended.

All sources asked to remain anonymous because the matter was not public. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.

COORDINATION

Foxconn, formally Hon Hai Precision Industry, is the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer. It has half a dozen plants in northern Vietnam including in Bac Giang province where local authorities said it assembles Apple MacBooks and iPads.

State-owned provincial power distributor Bac Giang Power Company (BG PC) said in March it had asked industrial parks and authorities ""to coordinate in implementing electricity savings,"" showed a statement on the website of power regulator ERAV.

BG PC Deputy Director Do Binh Duong, in a separate statement, said ""adjustment of power loads, adjustment of production plans and electricity saving implementation of enterprises will have a great impact on the power system"".

The Ministry of Industry and Trade and state-owned power provider Vietnam Electricity (EVN), of which BG PC is a unit, did not respond to requests for comment.

Energy-saving measures appear to differ nationwide. An official at an industrial park in another northern province said manufacturers have been asked to reduce power consumption on some days this month.

Weather conditions are less challenging than in 2023 but authorities have boosted imports of coal and encouraged energy-saving to avoid shortages.

In March, foreign chambers of commerce urged the government to guarantee power supply, with South Korean's KoCham saying semiconductor companies had delayed investment decisions because of power supply risk.

141a72ad76,The Washington Post,Perspective | A tree falls and reminds us of the fragility of our lives - The Washington Post,"“I saw this guy grilling over there the other day,” said Aeryk Parker, 30, standing in the shade of a sugar maple at Garfield Park and pointing to a picnic table.

Parker and his dog, Tommy, a white and black American Staffordshire terrier, were on their daily walk in the D.C. park.

The energy at the park was different this day. News cameras nearly outnumbered the dogs. A horrible tragedy had happened at the park the day before, when a tree limb fell on a woman, killing her. And it got Parker thinking.

“I thought: ‘You know what? I’m getting to the age that I should be doing the cookouts,’ ” he said. “And this made me think it’s really time to do that. Because you never know what day is going to be your last day.”

The morning before, one of the park’s grandest trees, a swamp white oak more than a century old, dropped a branch with zero warning and fatally struck Sarah Noah.

Noah, 35, was in the park walking her dog when there was a loud crack and pop just after 7 a.m. Wednesday, prompting everyone to run in different directions.

Witnesses who saw the accident and ran toward Noah said it was impossible to move the massive branch. First responders who got there minutes later said Noah, a much-loved Pilates instructor on Capitol Hill, showed no signs of life.

“It’s devastating,” said one of my Capitol Hill neighbors, who also remembers soccer games and picnics with her kids right under that massive tree. I do, too — I remember parking the stroller and spreading the blanket dozens of times on that spot, a hub for the Capitol Hill community and a 15-minute walk from the Capitol dome.

All that remained Thursday morning was a huge stump — the size of a kitchen table — that was slowly filling with gorgeous bouquets of white roses and purple peonies. The grass around it, unused to being without that massive shade canopy, was searing in the sunlight.

How does anyone make sense of something like this?

“It just puts things in perspective, you know?” said Timothy Crowley, 30, who was taking his pup Rosie for a walk before he began his work-from-home afternoon shift.

When a community’s tragedy is caused by human violence — and Garfield Park had its share of that back in the day — the grief and anger has a place to land: guns, gangs, lack of opportunities for wayward youth, lax sentencing, taxed cops.

A traffic accident? Aggressive drivers, poor signage, traffic patterns.

But a tree branch from a seemingly healthy oak?

My colleagues asked all the right questions. Was the tree rotting? Had it been maintained? Was the city taking care of it?

City landscapers said it had been trimmed and inspected in 2022. It is logged in the citywide database of all the trees that make D.C. so green, so livable. On Thursday, arborists were buzzing around the rest of the park’s trees, measuring, cutting, looking up.

The oak that killed Noah seemed like such a solid, reliable tree that it had recently hosted the North American Tree Climbing Championship. Jeff Inman, an arborist in Richmond who won the competition, told my colleagues that a volunteer crew examined and performed maintenance on the trees in Garfield Park in October to make sure they were safe for climbing.

We’re used to trees falling in storms and high winds. But on a sweltering, summer day, when the air was still and sticky?

Neighbors wrote a letter to city officials this week underscoring their multiple requests for landscaping, trimming and inspection of trees in the park.

Parker, the man walking his dog, Tommy, and realizing he’d walked under that tree shortly before Noah died there, is a D.C. native who works as a security guard in one of the city’s hardscrabble shelters. He’s spent his whole life knowing when to have his guard up, when to look over his shoulder.

ed20e9d308,USA TODAY,"Donald Trump's birthday is today. At 78, he still loves to joke about Biden's age - USA TODAY","If elected in November, former President Donald Trump would become the oldest U.S. president ever to be inaugurated. His campaign strategy? Mock his opponent’s age, who is just three years older than himself.

Trump celebrated his 78th birthday on Friday, reaching the same age President Joe Biden was when he won the election. Though Biden has taken most of the fall for age-related concerns, Trump hasn’t been exempt from questions about his cognitive function himself.

More:Campaign trail gaffes by Trump and Biden put a spotlight on their ages. Should voters worry?

Over the years, Trump’s attacks on Biden’s age have varied from veiled to overt as his own tally climbed.

Here are just some of the digs Trump has made about his opponent’s age:

More:'A loser': With new bag of taunts, Biden tries to get under Trump's skin

“Sleepy Joe”

The mocking phrase “Sleepy Joe” was coined by Trump in 2019 during his re-election campaign, making fun of moments when Biden looked unalert.

In a campaign event in Manchester, New Hampshire, in August 2020, Trump said, “The guy doesn’t even know he’s alive!”

“We’ve got a sleepy guy in the basement of the house,” Trump said of Biden in April 2020.

“Young, vibrant man”

In 2019, Trump took a dig at his then-presidential candidates, Biden and independent U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders.

“I think that I just feel like a young man,” Trump told reporters. “I’m so young. I can’t believe it, I’m the youngest person.”

Sometimes, without directly noting his age, Trump compares his own mental fortitude to Biden.

“I am a young, vibrant man. I look at Joe, I don’t know about him,” Trump said. “I don’t know, I would never say anyone is too old.”

Not too old, “too incompetent”

In May, Trump backpedaled his age jokes and pivoted less than a month before his birthday.

“JOE BIDEN IS NOT TOO OLD TO BE PRESIDENT—NOT EVEN CLOSE—BUT HE IS TOO INCOMPETENT AND CORRUPT!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Trump responded to Biden’s May 2023 stumble and fall onstage by saying that he asked Fox News host Sean Hannity not to joke about the president’s cognitive abilities.

“I asked Sean not to joke about it,” Trump said during a town hall. “I said, ‘Honestly, I don’t think it looks good for you or for anybody to joke about it.’”",A man in a blue suit and yellow tie stands with his arms outstretched in front of a large screen displaying a blurred image of a man's face and a sign that reads 'NEVER YIELD'.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6B7EF556C0>,2024-06-14 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.usatoday.com,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/06/14/donald-trump-birthday-biden-age-jokes/74096503007/,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/ed20e9d308.png
e506df520c,The Washington Post,Biden’s science adviser explains the new hard line on China - The Washington Post,"Early in her career, Arati Prabhakar led the development of a self-piloting ship for a secretive U.S. military research agency. Now she’s the White House’s top technology official — the first to hail from a defense background since the Cold War and a representative of Washington’s new hard-line consensus on China.

For three decades, the United States threw itself headlong into globalization, backed by the confidence that while a rising tide lifts all boats, America’s vessel would rise the highest. China’s technological ascent has shaken that self-assurance and prompted a broad policy reversal.

“We had an oversimplified model for a long time, for a number of decades,” Prabhakar said in an interview with The Washington Post. “That oversimplified model was that markets and globalization would solve all the problems.”

Prabhakar’s early specialty was semiconductor research, a rare background among senior policymakers. That technical knowledge has come into use, as she has helped the Biden administration craft the largest industrial policy push in decades, in an effort to help the United States retain its technological lead over China. Semiconductors — the brains of computers — are the program’s centerpiece.

“It’s the biggest industrial policy initiative in the U.S. since the Second World War,” said Gary Hufbauer, a former Treasury deputy assistant secretary and now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “The only thing that the U.S. did which was comparable was the interstate highway system back in the 1950s.”

Kevin Wolf, a former assistant commerce secretary for export administration, says the Biden administration has enacted the strictest technology export controls against China in recent memory, adopting the policy position that China having the capability to produce advanced computing systems indigenously is a “per se national security threat” to the United States.

The hard-line shift is reflected in the appointment of Prabhakar, 65, as the president’s science and technology adviser in 2022. Her recent predecessors were all scholars from civilian fields like biology and meteorology.

In contrast, Prabhakar previously oversaw the Pentagon’s futuristic technologies research agency, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Her team at the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy now is tasked with thorny questions of how to accelerate U.S. innovation in technologies with military applications — semiconductors, telecommunications and quantum computing — while curbing U.S. research connections to China without veering into racial profiling.

Many of these projects will take far longer than a four-year presidential term to accomplish, a recognition that the technological rivalry with China may last decades, as the Cold War did.

Her team is already maneuvering to wrangle commitments from allied nations to support U.S. wireless technologies over China’s for the 6G generation, which won’t deploy until around 2030. U.S. officials had been caught flat-footed with 5G, with China getting a jump-start on 5G research and development and rolling out its networks faster.

“It is the right time to start lining everyone up,” Prabhakar said about building a 6G coalition around the U.S. position.

Her office sits in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House grounds, down a hallway checkered black-and-white like a chess board. The Bruce Springsteen lyric “Meet me in a land of hope and dreams” is emblazoned across the wall.

After immigrating to the United States from India with her parents as a child, Prabhakar earned a PhD in applied physics from the California Institute of Technology, then strayed from the academic career path. She was working at DARPA in 1986 at the tail end of the Cold War.

“The Soviet Union ended while I was at DARPA, and so I saw what an enormous shift started in how we thought about national security,” she said.

Following the Soviet Union’s dissolution in 1991, one of her colleagues went to brief Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, about submarines, only for Powell to remark that they didn’t care about submarines anymore. Washington downsized its military and embraced globalization, secure in its position as the unquestioned world leader.

“We were riding high,” said Rob Atkinson, founder of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. “We were the center of the internet and the IT economy. China was nothing. … We assumed that would continue in perpetuity.”

China’s unexpected emergence as a serious technological rival has prompted a return to a Cold War-like chill. President Donald Trump began the pivot, launching a trade war against China. Since arriving in the Oval Office, President Biden — who criticized those policies at first — has surprised many by doubling down on Trump’s tariffs and export controls, though with more measured rhetoric and a focus on multilateral cooperation.

National security adviser Jake Sullivan announced in September 2022 that the United States could no longer just maintain a “relative” technological lead over rivals and “must maintain as large of a lead as possible.” Soon after, the Commerce Department, led by Gina Raimondo, fired a fusillade of technology export controls at China.

Prabhakar’s team has been working on a longer-term research and development strategy, including directing research projects in quantum computing and cancer treatment, and trying to wrangle multiple agencies to cooperate to squeeze out more radio spectrum for emerging technologies in an effort to get a jump on 6G in competition against China.

The Biden administration also has leaned hard into industrial policy in key technological sectors such as chips and telecommunications gear, with the help of $52 billion in funding from the bipartisan Chips and Science Act.

Ken Zita, a telecom expert who advised the Biden administration on industrial policies, said Washington was making the leap from “no industrial policy” to “having one” after many years in which industrial planning by the federal government was deeply out of fashion.

“They’ve had to take it from whole cloth, and say, ‘What can we do? Where can we act?’” Zita said.

A major challenge for the Biden administration has been how to pursue this policy shift without fanning anti-Chinese sentiment.

Prabhakar’s team is drafting research security guidelines for universities across the nation on how they should limit and monitor research relationships with China and other countries deemed adversaries. This task was inherited from the Trump administration.

Prabhakar said her team is now “pretty close” to a final version of the rules, though she stopped short of saying when they may be released. She said that after they released a draft version of the rules for comment last year, feedback from the research community gave her pause, including input that the requirements for universities were too onerous.

“It’s possible to put in so much process that you actually exacerbate the problem,” she said. The House Committee on Science, Space and Technology questioned Prabhakar in February over the delays in producing a final version of the rules. She told the committee that drafting the regulations had turned out to be more complex than expected.

“Doing this in a way that respects every individual, their rights as an individual and respecting their dignity, I think, is critically important,” she said. “Not exacerbating anti-Asian bias in the environment that we are in — absolutely key.”

The draft guidelines issued by her office for comment call for research institutes’ training programs to include instruction on “the importance of nondiscrimination as a guiding principle,” though it isn’t entirely clear what this would look like in practice.

More broadly, the Biden administration’s approach to China has its share of skeptics. Some foreign governments suspect the export controls are more about trade protectionism than national security necessity.

“When I do travel — and by overseas I mean Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, U.K., you know, allied countries — almost to a person, they don’t really understand what the national security objective is that the U.S. government is trying to accomplish with all these new controls,” said Wolf, the former assistant commerce secretary.

Some, such as Atkinson, say the grants for building new U.S. technological hubs have been distributed too diffusely.

“The whole point of this was you can’t have 50 places,” he said. “There’s not enough money. There’s not enough technology to go around.”

Prabhakar defended these measures as part of a carefully considered long-term plan to ensure U.S. competitiveness.

“It’s important to say that this is a really carefully calibrated strategy. It’s not saying, ‘We’re going to roll up the sidewalks and never trade with anyone else around the world.’ It’s very globally engaged, working with our allies and partners.”","An older woman in a pink blazer stands in front of a portrait of George Washington, with a fireplace and ornate wallpaper in the background.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6B7E241E10>,2024-06-03 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/06/03/arati-prabhakar-china-tech/,['Politics' 'International' 'Technology'],[0.9 0.8 0.7],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/e506df520c.png
b47b389370,The Guardian US,RFK Jr says Trump is ‘a sociopath’ – despite link to job if Republican wins - The Guardian US,"The independent US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr called Donald Trump “a terrible human being”, the “worse [sic] president ever” and “barely human”.

“He is probably a sociopath,” Kennedy said in texts to an unnamed person, the New Yorker reported on Monday.

Kennedy has been linked to a job in a second Trump administration, not least after Kennedy’s son posted footage of such a move appearing to be discussed. Kennedy attended the Republican convention in Milwaukee in July.

On Monday, a spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Kennedy’s reported remarks.

They were included in an in-depth New Yorker profile otherwise remarkable for containing the story of how Kennedy came to dump a dead bear in Central Park 10 years ago.

Kennedy sought to pre-empt coverage of the bear story, posting video of him recounting it to the actor and Trump supporter Roseanne Barr and saying: “Looking forward to seeing how you spin this one, New Yorker.”

The published description of the dumping of the bear carcass largely followed Kennedy’s own. The magazine did include a picture of Kennedy posing with his fingers in the bear’s bloodied mouth and the verdict of “a retired Bronx homicide commander” who spoke to the New York Times about the episode, which was reported in 2014: “People are crazy.”

The profile author, Clare Malone, wrote: “When I asked Kennedy about the incident, he said, ‘Maybe that’s where I got my brain worm.’”

That was a reference to a report in which the Times surfaced a deposition from one of Kennedy’s divorces in which he said a parasitic worm ate part of his brain.

Then, Kennedy said: “I offer to eat five more brain worms and still beat President Trump and President Biden in a debate.”

Joe Biden has since dropped out of November’s race, in favour of his vice-president, Kamala Harris. Kennedy’s polling numbers have slipped, but both major campaigns still fear his impact in battleground states.

A son of Robert F Kennedy, a former US attorney general and New York senator, and nephew of John F Kennedy, the 35th president, Kennedy is an environmental attorney turned vaccine conspiracy theorist and political gadfly. He was nine and 14, respectively, when his uncle and father were each assassinated.

The New Yorker profile contained extensive descriptions of his gilded upbringing, his drug use, his sexual behaviour, his environmental work and his slide into anti-vaccine campaigning, efforts supercharged by the Covid pandemic.

According to the New Yorker, in the texts in which he abused Trump – thereby joining JD Vance, Trump’s running mate whose previous disdain has been widely reported – Kennedy also said Biden was “more dangerous to the Republic and the planet”.

Speculation Kennedy would drop out and accept a job from Trump surged around the posted call between the two men and the Republican convention. Amaryllis Fox Kennedy, Kennedy’s daughter-in-law and campaign director, told the New Yorker Trump had indeed offered Kennedy a job.

“They said, ‘You know, we know that you take more from us than you take from Biden … Is there something that you would want to do?’” Fox Kennedy reportedly remarked.

She said Kennedy would be interested in secretary of health and human services, but he would also listen to offers from Harris.

Kennedy has achieved ballot access in about a dozen states. Nonetheless, Fox Kennedy said the campaign thought it could win the White House via a contingent election: in which no candidate wins enough electoral college votes, throwing the choice to the House of Representatives.","An older man in a dark suit stands at a podium with a microphone, gesturing with his right hand.

d5bd788315,The Globe and Mail,"Paris Olympics: Auger-Aliassime, Andreescu victorious in first tennis singles round - The Globe and Mail","It’s a great start for Canadian tennis at the Paris Olympics as Félix Auger-Aliassime, Bianca Andreescu and Leylah Fernandez all posted victories on Sunday.

Veteran Milos Raonic was the only Canadian to lose, dropping two tiebreaks in defeat.

All four players waited an extra day to get under way in first-round singles action after heavy rain scrubbed Saturday’s schedule at Roland Garros.

Montreal’s Auger-Aliassime fired 10 aces as he made quick work of American Marcos Giron with a 6-1, 6-4 straight-set victory.

In the women’s draw, Andreescu, of Mississauga, converted four of six breaks in an efficient 6-2, 6-3 win over Denmark’s Clara Tauson, while Fernandez, of Laval, Que., outlasted Karolina Muchova of Czechia 6-1, 4-6, 6-2 in a match that lasted 2 hours 21 minutes.

Raonic, of Thornhill, Ont., fell to Dominik Koepfer of Germany 6-7 (2), 7-6 (5), 7-6 (1) in 2:23.

Despite his dominant display, Auger-Aliassime says he was far from perfect on Sunday.

“No, there’s always room for improvement,” he said in French. “On the serve, it was very good, but I think that on the return, especially in the second set, I could have done more to apply more pressure. But since my serve went so well, I was able to use it well in the set.”

Still, the match showcased Auger-Aliassime’s blend of power, finesse, precision, and mental strength.

“There was a nice variety. I think it’s good to show all of my strengths in the game,” said Auger-Aliassime, who made in Olympic debut in Tokyo three years ago.

Meanwhile, Andreescu felt comfortable from the get-go in her match with Tauson.

“It wasn’t easy. I mean, no match is easy, but I feel like my mentality right from the start, I was on it right from the first point, and that was the goal going into the match,” she said. “And I did that really well. I was serving well. I was returning well and, yeah, that’s all I can ask for.”

Andreescu is making her Olympic debut after injuries forced her to pull out of the Tokyo Games.

“I don’t think there are any words to describe this. The crowd, first of all, was incredible from both sides. It was a superfun atmosphere,” Andreescu said of the atmosphere at Roland Garros.

Fernandez led by a set and was up 4-2 in the second before the No. 29-ranked Muchova, a 2023 French Open finalist, stormed back to take it.

The Canadian regained her composure in the final set, earning three breaks to bring her total to seven, helping her advance to the second round on her third match point.

“It wasn’t easy, but I’m happy with my fight, my competitiveness and my positivity,” Fernandez said. “I’m happy not to have given up and to have found a solution in the third set.”

Fernandez made 20 unforced errors, while Muchova committed 43.

The lengthy matchup forced Fernandez’s women’s doubles match with Ottawa’s Gabriela Dabrowski against France’s Clara Burel and Varvara Gracheva to be postponed to Monday.","A tennis player in a red shirt and white shorts is in the middle of a forehand swing, with a tennis ball in the air, against a blue background with Olympic rings.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BCA81C1C0>,2024-07-28 17:13:03.911000+00:00,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/olympics/article-auger-aliassime-andreescu-victorious-in-first-tennis-singles-round/,['Sports' 'International'],[0.95 0.85],Unlikely,Likely,sample_review/images/d5bd788315.png
3243796d17,CNN,Katie Ledecky: The rise of an Olympic great - CNN,"Michael Ledecky remembers the day he was first beaten by his younger sister Katie in the pool, wrenching his goggles from his head and breaking them in two, an odd mixture of pride and anger enveloping him on that August evening. Time hasn’t faded the memory.

The race, a 200m freestyle duel which he had instigated, was such a significant moment in his teenage life that he wrote about it for an English high school project. “How Katie managed to surpass me in my primary sport baffled me,” he wrote. “Why can’t I beat my younger sister?”

He was a high-achieving teenager; a freshman selected for his high school championship swimming team, a perfect-grade student who had hopes of representing an Ivy League swimming team. And he was as dedicated to the sport as his sister; waking up at 4:15 a.m. for practice, swimming morning after morning, looking down at nothing but the black line at the bottom of the pool before school.

Yet he came to realize on that summer’s night that his sister, whom he would compete against at almost anything – from pancake eating contests to board games – was the more talented swimmer.

What he didn’t recognize at the time, and no one in the family did – not even when she reached her first Olympic final – was that Katie Ledecky would become one of the greatest swimmers in history.

“She would typically beat my times from the year prior despite being three years younger and eventually she got me around the time I was a freshman and sophomore in high school,” Michael Ledecky tells CNN Sport. “But even then, I was exceptionally proud of what Katie was doing.”

The following fall she secured her first national age group record. “A very old record from the 1970s,” her brother recalls. “That really showed us she could take swimming well beyond the local competitions that she was winning.”

She would go on to break more records, win far more significant races: seven Olympic golds, a record 26 world championships medals, own 16 of the fastest 800m freestyle times ever swum by a woman, set 19 of the fastest 1500m freestyle times in history.

An Olympic great and still aged just 27, how did a thoughtful child who went to a private girls’ school in Bethesda, Maryland – a “truly mediocre swimmer” as she describes her six-year-old self – become a history-making, groundbreaking athlete with preternatural calm in the high noon moments of competition?

The teenager who achieved the unthinkable

In the dining hall of London’s Olympic Village, a few hours before her first Olympic final, Ledecky is eating lunch on her own. To onlookers, the 15-year-old appears calm, unruffled; characteristics which would become her hallmark over the next decade or so of competition.

“She was just sitting by herself,” Russell Mark, USA Swimming’s high-performance consultant at the time, tells CNN Sport. “Me and my colleague, George, thought, ‘Wow, she is so calm.’

“I recalled that story with her in the last few years and she remembers that lunch being so nervous, but that’s not how I remembered it at the time,” he adds, laughing.

That evening, at the London Aquatics Centre, Prince William and his wife Catherine are in attendance to cheer home favorite, world record holder and defending champion Rebecca Adlington in a race regarded as a head-to-head between the Briton and rising star Lotte Friis.

Little attention is given to Ledecky, competing in her first international event. “Invisibility would be my superpower,” she writes of that race in her memoir, “Just Add Water.”

When Adlington walks out onto the arena, the roars are loud enough to uproot trees. Ledecky tells herself the fans are singing “Ledecky” rather than “Becky,” and channels their energy as she aims for the unthinkable.

No one thinks she can topple the double Olympic champion in the most anticipated pool race of the Games, not even when, ignoring her coach’s advice, she sets off hard and fast. Though she does heed one piece of guidance from him, which Ledecky says in her book “changed everything,” which is to breathe more to her right side.

At 150m, the teenager is leading at world-record pace. By the halfway mark, she is still ahead.

“I couldn’t believe what I was watching,” says Michael, who was somewhere high in the rafters, “cheering my head off.”

As the race approaches the final 100m, Ledecky has a handsome lead, the world record is still within sight. With 50m to go, victory is assured and the battle is now between her and the clock, her rivals left to race among themselves. Commentators are aghast.

In one of the most extraordinary performances in Olympic history, Ledecky touches home in eight minutes, 14.63 seconds, then the second-fastest women’s 800m freestyle in history.

In her autobiography, she writes about her parents musing over how they would soothe their daughter’s post-race disappointment after she had called them in the lead-up and talked about winning a medal. With the benefit of hindsight, her brother realized his sister’s mindset was different.

“She was giving us advice on where we could stand for the medal ceremony if she got a medal, she was probably using the language, ‘If I get a medal,’ but she was saying it almost with the confidence of, ‘When I get a medal,’” he says.

The high school student who hadn’t told anyone other than her coach that her goal for the London Games was to make the US team had become the youngest Olympic gold medalist in her event’s history.

The million-dollar question

Success in elite sport is never without warning. It may come sooner than expected as an athlete bursts onto the world stage, but before the glory, there are almost always signs in the preceding years, telling those within the sport to take note of a special talent emerging.

In eighth grade, Ledecky competed against students four years older than her and won five events. By this time, she was was registering 40 miles a week in the pool. There were hints of what was to come, yet, as one of her former coaches explains, athletically at least in the world of swimming, she didn’t stand out.

“She doesn’t have a particularly large wingspan like Michael Phelps had. She doesn’t have a dominant, explosive jump or power like some of the more typical sprinters,” Bruce Gemmell, who became Ledecky’s coach after London 2012, tells CNN.

What makes Ledecky the driven athlete who would privately set swimming ‘want times’ for herself as a child is the “million-dollar question” says Gemmell. But, at the heart of her success, he says, is her love for the work, the practice, “the grind.”

“When I would introduce, or give her a quote-unquote new skill, she didn’t immediately adapt to it. But I would always find her working on it on her own for 15 minutes or half an hour every day for two or three weeks in a row until she became proficient at it,” Gemmell adds.

“There were times when I introduced something to her and forget about it, quite frankly. And six months later, I would say, ‘Why are you doing that? Or why are you working on that?’ And she would say, ‘You showed me to do it or told me to do it or ask me to do it.’ She was still working on it, and I forgot.”

Gemmell remembers Ledecky working on crossover turns, describing her initially as being extremely awkward at the transition from backstroke to breaststroke. She would practice on it on her own for 15 minutes each day, then introduce it in training sessions before, following three years of methodical self-improvement, she used it in meets.

“Eventually, she became the American record holder in the individual medley, which she had no right in doing because she’s not particularly good at the three other strokes, but through sheer grit and determination and willpower on her part, she made her way to become American record holder in it,” he says.

“It reminds me of a Michael Jordan type of person who just loves doing the work … I imagine it is true for the elite of the elite of the elite.”

‘Just trying hard’

On June 25, 2003, a seven-year-old Ledecky is competing in her first race, a 25-yard freestyle for the eight and unders. She finishes second. On the pool deck, her father conducts a light-hearted interview with his exhausted daughter after the race.

“What were you thinking about in the pool?’ he asks. “Nothing,” comes the reply. “Just trying to finish, huh?” her father follows up. “Just trying hard,” says Ledecky, who says in her autobiography that her approach to the sport has not changed since her competitive debut.

But there is more to her success than grit and hard work.

Mark says she is a “student of the sport and her own swimming.” “Insanely” competitive is how Gemmell describes his former pupil, a trait her brother testifies to as well.

Typically, an elite swimmer will have nine or 10 training sessions a week – Ledecky these days swims every day. It takes a certain personality to thrive when alone with their thoughts in the water for such a period, but there is nowhere Ledecky would rather be.

“It’s special to see that joy that she brings into what she does,” says her brother, explaining that a swimmer needs to embrace “monotony and repetition.”

His sister, he says, has a “positive internal monologue” and an ability to “shut her brain off” at certain points in a race, putting her trust in the work she had done over the years.

“She would race in a dark room as opposed to prefer to be under the media spotlight, just to get better against herself,” Gemmell says. “It’s in her DNA or something.”

A lineage of high achievers

Talent, an athlete’s hardware, is not enough in sport. There must be opportunity, a chance to thrive. Success is never self-made.

For Ledecky, the stars aligned when the family moved to an affluent Maryland area, where there was access to pools and high-level coaching.

An “incubator for dedicated swimmers” is how Ledecky describes the area in her book. Waiting lists for swim clubs were common. In fact, the Ledeckys’ didn’t join their nearest swim club because of a multi-year waiting list.

“There aren’t many areas in the world that are better than the DC area to become an elite athlete because you have the resources there and you have the community,” her brother says.

To perhaps truly grasp how and why a young Ledecky “rarely wavered” from her dedication to swimming – from eating the right foods to going to bed early and doing homework on the weekends – the family tree offers some insight. It is a lineage of high achievers, not of outstanding athletic achievement but of excellence in their chosen fields, nonetheless.

Her father David is a Harvard-educated lawyer; her mother Mary Gen was a collegiate swimmer. Her uncle Jon co-owns the NHL’s New York Islanders, while her brother also graduated from Harvard. Ledecky, of course, is herself a Stanford alumnus.

But it is perhaps her grandparents who contributed to her will to win the most.

Ledecky dedicates a chapter each to her grandparents in her recently published memoir. “I think that indicates how much meaning she takes from them,” her brother says.

It was her grandmothers Ledecky thought of in the 1500m freestyle Olympic final in Tokyo following defeat in the 200m freestyle that same evening, giving her purpose to dig deeper, the strength to overcome disappointment and make history by becoming the first woman to win Olympic gold in the event.

At the 2015 world championships in Kazan, Russia, where she twice broke the 1500m freestyle world record, she thought of her grandfathers as she swam to glory in the final, having dreamed about them two nights before the race.

Her maternal grandfather, Edward Hagan, who died when Ledecky was 11, was a Navy doctor who went to war in 1943, aged 26 years old, and was awarded the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars and a purple heart for his service. “He had a burning desire to make a difference,” Ledecky writes of the man whom it is said she shares her optimism and reserve, and the man who successfully campaigned for every elementary school in his hometown of Woolaston, North Dakota, to offer swimming lessons after his own daughter, one of Ledecky’s aunts, fell off a dock as a four-year-old.

Ledecky is named after her maternal grandmother, Kathleen, who grew up on a cattle ranch, became a nurse and a mother of seven. She is 98 years old and a role model for Ledecky, she writes, for her upbeat attitude and perspective on life.

Her paternal grandmother Berta, a writer, “blazed through in elite education,” says Ledecky and as a college student spent a year translating for Albert Einstein at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn.

Jaromir “Jerry” Ledecky, her paternal grandfather, emigrated to America from Czechoslovakia in 1947 on a scholarship to study at Rutgers in New York and was warned not to return to his homeland by his father after the Soviet coup d’état a year later.

He worked as a dishwasher while putting himself through university, earned a masters, a Ph.D, and in the final year of his life taught himself Swedish, the eighth language in which he became fluent. “I’d like to imagine I inherited some of my nerve and perseverance from him,” writes Ledecky.

In her autobiography, Ledecky describes the family motto as “doing your best” and her parents as the total opposite of “stage parents.”

“They matched our energy and enthusiasm and made sure we had fun along the way,” she says of the support her parents offered.

Her brother says that “striving to be your best was encouraged” and that their parents would provide “the resources and the time [needed] to succeed.”

What her brother doesn’t mention during the interview, but Ledecky does in her memoir, is the influence he has had on his younger sister, to whom she also dedicates a chapter in her book. If Michael had been into another sport, then swimming may have lost out on a great champion.

“Whatever Michael wanted to do, I wanted to do,” she writes, explaining that the siblings would “soft coach” each other in their search for perfection in the pool.

“He made me feel it was OK to be a bit different, a bit nerdy, or quirky … I saw the joy Michael took in setting big goals for himself and reaching them.”

The ‘eureka’ moment

Aged 14, Ledecky and her then coach Yuri Suguiyama stumbled upon what she calls a “true eureka moment,” a freestyle technique based on Michael Phelps’ “galloping” stroke which propelled her forward with increasing speed.

“This modification was the best thing that could’ve happened to my swimming style,” she writes.

It has often been described that her technique of breathing to one side is like that of a man’s, something which bothers Ledecky. “Technique has no gender,” she says in her book.

The consistency of her rhythm, tempo and cadence are also key to her success, explains Mark, attributing her reliability to her mechanics.

“I would say her stroke is the model,” he says. “The efficiency, no wasted movements. The position she gets herself into while it takes skill and coordination, it all starts with the biomechanical foundation of her strokes. While there’s some natural foundation, she puts a lot of thought into her mechanics and maintaining it.”

Mark refers to the ‘catch,’ which is the first part of the underwater stroke, getting the palm of the hand to push water back towards the feet as early as possible, the key to moving forward efficiently.

“Most people, when they take the breath that positioning is really hard to get to because you have to turn your head to one side, your body turns to one side, making it an obstacle to get that catch position with your non-breathing arm, so she’s great at it,” he says.

Ledecky says her technique has changed slightly under the tutelage of Andrew Nesty in Gainesville, Florida, whose training group she joined after the Tokyo Olympics. Her kick has been refined, she says in her book, her stroke is longer, her rotation recalibrated. She was even told to become more athletic.

Perhaps ominously for her competitors in Paris, she is swimming faster than she has for years. Her 800m freestyle time at the 2023 USA swimming championships in Indianapolis was her fastest over the distance since the Rio Games, where she broke the world record. However, earlier this year, she was beaten in an 800m freestyle final for the first time since 2010, ending an incredible period of dominance in an event in which she is the three-time defending Olympic champion.

“I’ve a big career behind me, but I’m continuing to try to get better,” Ledecky says in her book.

‘A better person than she is a swimmer’

Whatever happens in Paris, whether Ledecky adds to her Olympic haul or not, her legacy is assured.

She is the greatest distance swimmer of all time, excelling from 200m to 1500m freestyle, something thought impossible before Ledecky proved otherwise. Two further golds in the French capital would make her the most successful female swimmer in Olympic history.

“She’s certainly on the Mount Rushmore of American women athletes, but I don’t know if that Mount Rushmore is three athletes or five athletes or seven athletes. She’s just one of them,” says Gemmell.

The most decorated female swimmer in history, Ledecky has broken 14 world records and 37 national records and has never lost an 800m or 1500m freestyle race at the world championships or Olympics. Earlier this year, she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from US President Joe Biden.

In Paris, however, she will not be the overwhelming favorite in all the events in which she will compete, a testimony to her success, to her inspiring the next generation.

The women’s 400m freestyle final on Saturday, for example, should be one of the most competitive races in the pool as three of the fastest swimmers of all time in the distance – Ledecky, Ariarne Titmus (the world record holder and defending champion) and Summer McIntosh – vie for gold

“I think around how the world watched her swimming the 400 free, the way she swam it just tenaciously and attacking it and decided that they too could do that. And in some ways, the world has caught up with her,” says Gemmell.

In her autobiography, Ledecky writes about her legacy, of how she would like to be remembered for more than her medals and world records. Kindness, to her, is as important as her athletic talent.

It is because of such an outlook that Gemmell loves talking about his erstwhile student.

“She is such a lovely young lady in all senses of the word,” he says. “She is a better person than she is a swimmer – and she is a pretty good swimmer.”

For the Ledecky family, the journey has been unexpected. From beating her brother for the first time to Olympic greatness, it is a story they could not have foretold.

“Katie’s success wasn’t pre-ordained, not inevitable,” her brother says. “She’s really made herself into who she is through hard work; her mindset and results are attributed to positive thinking and mental toughness and a supportive community around her.

“I’m incredibly proud of her. It’s been really special having a front row seat to what she’s accomplished.”","A woman in a black swimsuit is depicted in a dynamic pose, holding a white swim cap, with a blue and red circular background behind her.

ee7389f836,The Guardian,Not in the minister’s back yard: is Starmer’s cabinet onboard with housebuilding plans? - The Guardian,"1. Angela Rayner, secretary of state for housing, communities and local government

The deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, who assumed the responsibility of housing and local government upon Labour’s victory last month, has made clear her intentions to build the 1.5m new homes that Labour has promised.

Despite this, she has also previously opposed building on green belts, something that Labour will probably have to do to fulfil its promises. In 2019, she released a statement against a proposal to build 132 homes on the site of a former primary school and in 2017 she marched with residents of Ashton Hurst, Greater Manchester, as they protested against plans to develop homes on green belt land.

2. Rachel Reeves, chancellor of the exchequer

Rachel Reeves, the first ever female chancellor, has been probably the biggest proponent of the need to build homes on green belt land aside from Starmer himself. Despite this, she has spoken out in the past against housing development in her constituency of Leeds West and Pudsey.

In 2019, she opposed the construction of more than 60 council homes on a disused field on the city’s west side. A lengthy public debate ended in 2022 when Leeds city council’s decision to grant the planning permissions was deemed unlawful.

3. Yvette Cooper, home secretary

Yvette Cooper, a former leadership candidate, was made home secretary by Starmer. Though she had previously pledged to build 500,000 homes during her unsuccessful 2015 leadership campaign, Cooper has also opposed housing plans around West Yorkshire, where her constituency is.

Most recently she backed campaigners who opposed a proposal to build more than 400 new homes, including retirement homes, in Wakefield. Reportedly, one of Cooper’s reasons for being against the plans was that the building of the homes would negatively affect the “village status” of the area.

4. Wes Streeting, secretary of state for health and social care

Wes Streeting has spoken positively about recent developments in housing, but back in 2017 was part of a campaign that successfully prevented the building of 850 new homes on a series of playing fields in his Ilford constituency.

Since becoming a minister, Streeting has also reportedly cast doubts on the feasibility of building the previously planned 40 new hospitals by 2030, citing a lack of faith that the deadline can be met.

5. Pat McFadden, chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster

Pat McFadden, the MP for Wolverhampton South East and the new chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, has in the past opposed a variety of housing builds in his West Midlands constituency, including a proposal to build 40 new homes in the town of Bilston.

He also backed the Boris Johnson-endorsed campaign to prevent the development of up to 1,300 new homes in the countryside surrounding the city, saying Wolverhampton “should not be forced to choose between the new housing that we need and the green spaces that we love”.",A group of people holding a sign that reads 'I promise to defend the Redbridge Green Belt and future Generations and to oppose any plans to build on it.'

655bacf29a,New York Post,"Joe Biden was a terrible president no matter his age, and Dems still have to answer for it - New York Post","Joe Biden dropping out of the presidential race solves one problem, and one problem only, for Democrats: Age.

Senility was only ever the cherry on top of an ice cream sundae of catastrophe that was Biden’s failed presidency.

On every topic — the economy, foreign policy, social issues — his administration has let America down. That won’t be fixed by him stepping aside.

Long before Biden’s zombie-eyed performance in a national debate, a majority of Americans decided he wasn’t up to the job of commander in chief.

His most recent Gallup approval rating is a dismal 38%. Way back in 2022, a year into his term, it was . . . 38%. The rot runs deep.

Kamala Harris, the likely nominee, may brag that she can use the tall steps on Air Force One. But in every other way, she owns, and is responsible for, these Democratic disasters.

It’s highly unlikely the party will run against the Biden record, and would have no credibility if they did. So if you’re proposing a continuation of the Biden legacy, how do you defend it?

Biden came into office at the end of the pandemic. Operation Warp Speed had developed vaccines faster than anyone thought possible, and the country was opening up again. People were ready to go on vacation, go out to eat, travel.

The president decided what the moment needed was more stimulus, free cash for everyone, and a massive bill chockablock with progressive programs meant to keep even more Americans dependent on the federal government.

Not surprisingly, inflation skyrocketed. You can’t spend that much money and not expect the market to respond. By 2022, the average rate of inflation was 8%, levels not seen since the early 1980s.

Biden would spend the rest of his presidency lying about all this. He claims he came into office when COVID was raging (it wasn’t, the first vaccine was given in December 2020, and most Americans were given the shot before he took the oath), that inflation was already high (it was 1.2%) and that he “created” millions of jobs (with COVID over, companies started hiring again; it would take more than two years to recover all the jobs lost during the pandemic).

Getting a nice raise would have softened the blow, but Biden had a plan to make sure that didn’t happen.

The latest on President Biden’s decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential race:

Biden drops out of presidential race: live updates

Kamala Harris campaign flooded with ‘record-breaking’ $81 million in donations in first 24 hours after Biden drops out

Top Dems threatened to forcibly remove Biden from office unless he resigned, set him up to fail at Trump debate: sources

Schumer, Pelosi played ‘good cop, bad cop’ to convince Biden to drop out with ex-speaker stating, ‘Easy way or the hard way’

Trump and JD Vance accuse Dems of leading ‘coup’ against Biden, call to ‘invoke the 25th Amendment’

He rescinded all Trump-era policies at the border, and has let in at least 10 million people illegally — flooding the job market and driving down the cost of labor. Not to mention adding an enormous burden on taxpayers from Texas to New York.

This particular millstone hangs heavy on Harris. She was made the “border czar,” a job she soon ignored.

People were waved in with the flimsiest of asylum claims. We must solve the “root causes,” Harris claimed, making exactly one trip to Central America. Then . . . nothing.

Venezuela is still a kleptocracy. Haiti is in chaos. Mexico doesn’t care about securing the border. Now more migrants are coming from as far-flung places as Tajikistan. So many root causes, and none of them given a thought by Kamala Harris.

WIth the economy and the border doing so well, Biden turned his attention to Afghanistan, or didn’t really.

Rather than come up with a plan to safely evacuate our forces, US civilians and our Afghan allies, the US let the Taliban march through Kabul, then oversaw a horror-film mob scene at the airport that culminated in the deaths of 13 American soldiers.

Biden honored the return of their bodies by looking at his watch. At the debate last month, he spat on their memories by claiming no troops had died during his term. It is Biden’s most shameful chapter.

On the international front, Biden continued to appease Iran, which responded by funding terror groups, killing more Americans troops the president won’t acknowledge, and sponsoring a deadly terror attack by Hamas against Israel.

He gave Ukraine just enough aid to hold their own but not turn the tide. He wandered away from NATO gatherings as China plotted a new hegemony.

Domestically, his signature legislation was a con and a lie. The lie was its name: The Inflation Reduction Act did nothing to lower inflation.

The con was how Biden claimed to holdout Sen. Joe Manchin that it would have a balanced energy policy. It didn’t.

It was billions in green subsidies that will drive up the cost of gasoline, fund loser companies and do about as good for both the environment and budgeting as setting a stack of cash on fire.

The “defender of democracy” regularly tried to disregard the will of Congress, the courts and the people with his own executive actions.

He transferred the cost of student loans to taxpayers. He forced girl’s sports teams to accept biological males. He got rid of work requirements for welfare.

All are being legally challenged, and when they fail, Democrats will claim the courts are biased for not allowing Biden to be a king.

This is why Biden is unpopular. This is why he’s down in the polls. Biden was going to lose the election not because he’s an “elderly man with a bad memory,” as the special counsel memorably noted. He was losing because he’s been a terrible president.

Changing nominees to Kamala Harris or whichever teeth-whitened governor wants to blow up the convention does nothing to change that.

In fact, it may even exacerbate it, as Harris is further to the left than Biden on many issues. It’s just failure with a new face.","A collage of images including a damaged building in Ukraine, a gas station with prices, a crowd at a border, and a large gathering of people in Afghanistan.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BA1B72050>,2024-07-21 00:00:00+00:00,https://nypost.com,https://nypost.com/2024/07/21/opinion/joe-biden-was-a-terrible-president-no-matter-his-age-and-dems-still-have-to-answer-for-it/,['Politics' 'Opinion/Editorial'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/655bacf29a.png
b5a8be29e0,Newsweek,YouTube Accused of Censoring Macklemore's 'Hind's Hall' - Newsweek,"YouTube has been accused of censoring the video for Macklemore's new song, ""Hind's Hall,"" on its platform.

On May 6, the rapper shared the track, which supports a free Palestine and student protests, on his social media accounts. The song also pays tribute to 6-year-old Hind Rajab, a Palestinian child who was killed by the Israeli military days after she had called emergency services begging to be rescued.

Rajab has become a symbol for people protesting the Israel-Hamas war. After students occupied Columbia University's Hamilton Hall, they unfurled a banner over the hall's facade that said ""Hind's Hall,"" paying tribute to Rajab, who was killed alongside her family and the EMTs who tried to save her.

The song's accompanying video is made up of clips of people protesting and showing support for Palestinians, plus various clips of police officers and politicians. At the time of writing, it had received 24.7 million views on X, formerly Twitter, and more than 75 million views on Instagram. However, the video has been age-restricted on YouTube, where it has been viewed 232,116 times, prompting social media users to accuse the company of limiting the song's reach.

On YouTube, users under 18 years of age or viewers who aren't signed in to an account cannot watch the video. When users click on the video, they are met with this message: ""The following content may contain graphic or violent imagery. Viewer discretion is advised.""

A spokesperson for YouTube explained why they age-restricted the video in a statement shared with Newsweek.

""We age-restricted this video in accordance with our violent or graphic content policies. Sometimes, content doesn't violate our policies, but it may not be appropriate for viewers under 18 and we may age-restrict it,"" they said.

According to YouTube, the company may age-restrict graphic or violent content documenting warzones.

Newsweek has contacted a spokesperson for Macklemore for comment by email.

Despite YouTube's Help Center statement, social media users have taken to X to accuse the company of censorship.

""When @YouTube age restricts a video, it kills the view count and means it won't come up as a suggested video. It age-restricted @macklemore song on Gaza 'Hind's Hall.' I believe that YouTube wields this tool for censorship,"" journalist Laila Al-Arian wrote on X.

""This is clearly being abused to limit the reach of this video. There's nothing in the video that should be age restricted,"" another user added. ""I've had every video I've shared on Twitter of protests involuntarily listed as sensitive media. This is clearly a coordinated effort across platforms.""

A commenter said: ""Why is @YouTube censoring @macklemore's powerful new song, Hind's Hall? There is literally zero justification for the blatant act of censorship. The 'age restriction' means the video's organic reach will be severely limited.""

On YouTube, users have also expressed their frustration with the age restriction in the video's comments section.

""YouTube didn't put age restrictions on songs of two different Israeli artists calling death on Palestinians and threatening Dua Lipa and Bella Hadid, but they put on an age restriction on this. Sounds right,"" one user wrote.

""The fact that there's a YouTube violence warning before the video just proves every single damn point he's making in the song,"" another added.

""A content warning, age restriction, 20k likes and 16k views? Meanwhile there are 48M views on IG. Make it more obvious that this is being suppressed,"" a commenter said.

Macklemore said when posting the video on social media that once the song was available on streaming platforms, all proceeds would go to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, a relief and human development agency for Palestinian refugees.

The rapper touched on various topics in the song, including American politics and police brutality, and questioned why peaceful protests were being deemed a threat.

The song's lyrics include ""What is threatenin' about divesting and wantin' peace? The problem isn't the protests, it's what they're protestin',"" ""Block the barricade until Palestine is free"" and ""When I was seven, I learned a lesson from Cube and Eazy-E. What was it again? Oh yeah, f*** the police.""

bc0e701e16,Newsweek,Stephen King Weighs In on Debate —'It's a Shame' - Newsweek,"Stephen King has shared his thoughts on the presidential debate that took place Thursday night, likening it to a boxing match.

President Joe Biden and Donald Trump faced off in their first presidential debate in Atlanta, Georgia, as they sought to win over undecided voters, as polls show the two candidates locked in a close race a little more than four months before the election. The two men sparred on issues including the economy, abortion and immigration. Political observers view the election as one of the most important races in modern history.

King has previously said that he joined the Democratic Party in 1970 and regularly shares his political opinions online, and now he has expressed his disapproval of the format of the debate.

Newsweek emailed a spokesperson for King for comment on Friday.

""DEBATE NIGHT IN AMERICA! Sweet Jesus! The networks are packaging this as entertainment, like a boxing match, and selling democracy down the river. It's a shame,"" the critically acclaimed author posted on X, formerly Twitter.

At the time of writing, his post had been viewed 1.4 million times.

King's posts are often divisive, and this post was no different. Some people took to the comments to show their support for Trump or Biden and others showed their support for the debate.

""Steve, presidential debates are enshrined in and required by the Constitution. This is the dictionary definition of democracy, which America invented,"" one person wrote.

""Trump is going to win in a landslide and return America to normalcy,"" someone else commented.

A third person added: ""UNPRECEDENTED. This is the first time in U.S. history that a sitting President will debate an 'insurrectionist' who's also a 'convicted criminal.'""

Others agreed with King, slamming the debate in itself, with one person writing: ""The hype around this is ridiculous.""

""Quite true, it's both infotainment and Friday night fights all rolled into one. Will it be the Thrilla in Manila? Will we see the Rope-a-Dupe at play? This isn't really a debate. Sadly our democracy is in the balance,"" a different X user commented.

""Never been more happy to miss a debate. Wake me when Spetember [sic] Ends—most undecided Americans,"" said another.

In light of recent polls showing Biden closing the gap with Trump but still trailing in several battleground states, Biden needed to perform well in the debate. Voters have expressed concerns about his age, despite a positive medical report from his physician Kevin O'Connor earlier this year.

During the debate, Biden drew scrutiny from Republicans and Democrats alike. His voice sounded hoarse, particularly as the debate began, and his answers at times seemed muddled. As the debate approached the midpoint, he seemed a bit sharper. But he is still facing a wave of criticism over his performance, including new calls for him to step down from the campaign. A Biden aide, however, told Newsweek that the president was battling a cold during the debate.

Like Biden, Trump also needed a strong debate performance. His standing in the polls has weakened in recent weeks, following a Manhattan jury finding him guilty of falsifying business documents. The conviction has had a minor, yet notable, effect on his polls, as Biden has gained ground.

Trump appeared more alert throughout the debate and largely avoided fueling concerns about his age. Some Democrats noted that he performed stronger than Biden.","An older man with grey hair and glasses, wearing a white shirt, stands against a purple background.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BA49DECB0>,2024-06-28 08:04:16+00:00,https://www.newsweek.com,https://www.newsweek.com/stephen-king-debate-donald-trump-joe-biden-shame-1918571,['Politics' 'National'],[0.9 0.8],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/bc0e701e16.png
2280297345,BBC.com,Guernsey election 2025: What do islanders want prioritised? - BBC.com,"What do islanders want politicians to prioritise?

With a year to go to Guernsey’s general election, what are voters' biggest concerns?

""The cost of airfares and Condor being cancelled so frequently are the top of my list,"" Jean Rouget told me over a cup of tea.

But fixing the island's transport links was not her only priority - in between me knocking on her door in L'Eree and trying other houses Mrs Renouf had made a list.

Improvements to the island's health system was her next priority.

""I used to be a nurse and we still aren't paying them enough and training them locally,"" she said.

Not everyone wrote me a list as I trekked around the island, but it was clear off-island travel was a top priority for many.

'Ridiculously expensive'

One man in a quiet clos, around the corner from the Last Post, was busy packing for a hastily rearranged flight when I rang his doorbell.

""I'm supposed to be going to France on Friday, but I've got to now go tomorrow so I've not got much time to talk to you,"" he said as he ushered me off his doorstep.

""It's ridiculously expensive and they chop and change at a moment's notice,"" he said.

He had been affected by recent changes to Aurigny's schedule, which meant he was now having to fly two days earlier than planned.

The message from the States-owned airline has been ""we're sorry and we're fixing it"", with a promise to focus on the core services and reduce disruption after recent “one-off” events.

Of the 50 or so homes I called at the second biggest topic was the future of education, but there was not a clear dividing line of two-schools versus everything else like in 2020.

Mother-of-two Rhian Whitchurch said her top priority was the future of education as she thought it was ""a bit of a mess at the moment"".

Education, Sport and Culture (ESC) would argue it has provided certainty with the progress it has made towards a new post-16 campus at Les Ozouets and plans to move the sixth form centre to La Mare De Carteret High School.

But Ms Whitchurch was not convinced.

""When it comes to secondary education I want to make sure that everyone is catered for, not just a few,"" she said.

Listen: Going Islandwide - a look at the critical issues

Small business owner Tracey Thomson, from St Peter Port, was also concerned about the future of education.

""We need to see a more direct approach,"" she said.

""I have kids who are doing A-levels and it's been uncertain... for the kids coming through, [and] as a parent, it must be so difficult at the moment [to see] what the future looks like.""

'Leaving the island'

There is political consensus Guernsey is in the middle of a housing crisis, with few properties built this political term and the affordability ratio of local housing - effectively what multiple of your salary do you need for a local property - at 16 which makes it the most unaffordable housing within western Europe.

Tracey Loveridge was surprised when I rapped on her door, but once she recovered she could not stop telling me about the problems the island's housing crisis was causing.

""For a lot of people needing deposits, wages aren't high enough to get it and it means a lot of young people are leaving the island,"" she said.

One woman at one of the social housing estates in the south of the island said there were people homeless and sofa-surfing who could only be helped by more houses being built.

Employment and Social Security President Peter Roffey, who is standing down at the next general election, agreed not enough had been done to ensure houses were built and suggested the States should get into the housebuilding game.

He is all too aware though, while the States can buy up land like it has this term, with a contracting and already scarce construction sector turning that land into housing is a long process.

But not everyone I met believed politics could be a force for change.

c6c63ac9df,CNN,Starmer pledges to ‘reset’ Britain as Labour takes over after 14 years of Conservative rule - CNN,"The Labour Party has won a landslide victory in the UK general election, sweeping into power after 14 years of Conservative rule on the back of a wave of public disillusionment.

Party leader Keir Starmer took over as prime minister on Friday after King Charles III formally asked him to form a new government, with the politician promising the British public he would steer the country towards “calmer waters.”

Starmer, 61, begins his term with what is one of the biggest parliamentary majorities in British history and is expected to introduce a program of far-reaching reforms.

Addressing the nation from outside 10 Downing Street for the first time as prime minister, Starmer had one overarching message: Change starts now.

“It is surely clear to everyone that our country needs a bigger reset, a rediscovery of who we are,” he said, cautioning that the national renewal he was promising would take time.

“Changing a country is not like flipping a switch, the world is now a more volatile place,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Conservative Party recorded the worst result in its history, prompting some commentators to observe that the overall election result was as much about British voters booting out the Conservatives as voting in Labour.

The party lost more than 250 of the seats it had held in the 650-seat Parliament since 2019. There were high-profile casualties, with the short-lived former Prime Minister Liz Truss and several cabinet ministers being booted out by voters.

Conservative leader and, as of Friday morning, former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak took responsibility for the electoral wipeout, apologizing to voters in his farewell address.

“I have given this job my all, but you have sent a clear signal that the government of the United Kingdom must change; and yours is the only judgment that matters,” he said on the doorstep of the famous 10 Downing Street residence.

Sunak announced he would resign as the leader of the Conservative Party as soon as arrangements were made to find his successor.

“I have heard your anger, your disappointment. And I take responsibility for this loss,” he told voters as his wife Akshata Murty stood by.

The handover of power is a swift – and sometimes brutal – process in the UK, with the outgoing prime minister replaced within hours of losing the election.

In keeping with tradition, Sunak left Downing Street for the last time immediately after his speech and was driven the short distance to Buckingham Palace to meet the King and hand in his resignation.

Having conceded the election in the early hours of Friday, Sunak was out of the job by midday.

An hour or so later, election winner Starmer arrived for a brief audience with the King. Leaving the palace as the newly minted prime minister, he then headed straight to Downing Street.

The two politicians paid respectful tribute to each other, even though they did not meet in person on Friday.

Sunak called his successor “a decent, public-spirited man who I respect” on his way out, while Starmer praised his predecessor’s “dedication and hard work” and highlighted the significance of him being the first British Asian prime minister.

Many winners, as many losers

While the night was marked by a seismic shift in power from the Conservatives to Labour, other parties scored big wins.

The Liberal Democrats went from winning just 11 seats at the 2019 general election to securing more than 70. Traditionally the third-biggest party across the UK, the Lib Dems have in the past struggled to break through and convert their relatively high vote share into parliamentary seats because of the UK’s first-past-the-post electoral system, which favors the biggest parties.

Reform UK, the insurgent rightwing populist party, won roughly 14% of the vote but took only five seats in parliament, having split the rightwing vote in many places and further hurt the Conservatives.

The grouping is led by Nigel Farage, the face of the Brexit movement and an ally of former US President Donald Trump. Farage himself was elected a member of parliament (MP) for the first time – after running unsuccessfully seven times in the past.

It was a good night too for the Green Party. While the party stood candidates in a record number of constituencies in this election, its official goal was to win four seats - and it succeeded in all four, managing to take two seats from the Conservatives.

Meanwhile, the Scottish National Party, or SNP, had a disastrous night, suffering a near total wipeout and ending up with just nine seats, compared to 47 previously.

While that defeat might put the push for an independent Scotland on the backburner for now, in Northern Ireland the Irish nationalist Sinn Féin became the biggest party, overtaking the Democratic Unionist Party, or DUP.

Sinn Féin advocates for a united Ireland and boycotts the UK Parliament, traditionally abstaining from Westminster politics. The DUP, meanwhile, wants a tighter relationship between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.

Turnout nationwide was low, at just below 60% - only the second time in the past century that more than 40% of voters decided to stay home.

And although Labour won by a landslide in terms of seats in parliament, the popular vote showed the party’s win was not a resounding victory. Labour only increased its vote share by a few percentage points from its dismal 2019 showing.

Government-building and soul searching

Starmer began to form his government on Friday, promising the public he would start working immediately. He appointed Rachel Reeves as the UK’s first female treasury chief and his long-time deputy party leader Angela Rayner as his deputy PM.

The new cabinet is expected to mirror Starmer’s former shadow government, although some Labour MPs might see their roles diminished following a poorer than expected showing in their individual constituencies.

Starmer also named David Lammy as Foreign Secretary and Yvette Cooper as Home Secretary.

The new prime minister begins his tenure with a strong personal mandate. The huge Labour victory is seen by many as his personal success.

His rise to the top job caps what has been a remarkable, and swift, transformation of the Labour Party since the last general election in 2019, when it suffered its worst loss in a generation under its former hard-left leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who, in another twist was re-elected as an independent after being expelled from Labour.

Starmer has moved the party back toward the center, promising sustainable public finances, no increases in income taxes and a green agenda.

Labour’s tally ended up just shy of the record-breaking majority secured by Tony Blair in 1997. The party’s stance on the war in Gaza may have been a factor, as might weeks of opinion polls predicting a massive Labour win, which may have impacted turnout.

Several pro-Palestinian independent candidates took seats that were expected to fall into Labour hands. Starmer – a former human rights lawyer – said shortly after the October 7 attacks by Hamas that Israel “has the right” to withhold power and water from Palestinian civilians in Gaza, but added: “Obviously, everything should be done within international law.” The party has since become increasingly critical of Israel’s conduct in Gaza and now supports a ceasefire, along with the return of hostages held by Hamas.

Meanwhile, the Tories, as the Conservatives are often referred to in the UK, must now endeavor to figure out where it all went so terribly wrong.

The party has likely paid a price for what are widely seen as years of chaos and a worsening standard of living under its watch.

A notable trigger for that turmoil was the decision by the then Prime Minister David Cameron to call a referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union. What started out as Cameron’s attempt to shut down the Euroskeptic opposition within his own party brought on years of uncertainty and infighting followed by Brexit – while many voters still support the country’s departure from the EU, it has caused Britons to be worse off than they used to be.

The Brexit debacle was followed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Its handling in Britain was marked by a series of scandals involving top government officials, including Sunak and former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who were fined for breaching the same rules they had imposed on citizens.

A cost-of-living crisis that hit much of Europe and the United States, exacerbated by energy prices sent soaring by the war in Ukraine, was made worse in the UK by the Truss government’s disastrous tax-cutting gamble, which caused a political and economic meltdown and sent the cost of borrowing skyrocketing.

But with turnout plunging to the lowest level in decades, one thing is certain: like elsewhere in the world, many people in the United Kingdom have become disillusioned with politics, losing their hope for a better future.

It will be up to Keir Starmer to convince them otherwise – a tough job given the sluggish economy, war in Ukraine and the Middle East and the unfolding climate crisis.","A man in a suit is surrounded by people holding British flags, with a blurred face, in a setting that suggests a public event.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6B7DF8BAC0>,2024-07-05 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/05/uk/uk-election-labour-win-gbr-intl/index.html,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/c6c63ac9df.png
ab3efe36c2,CNN,St. Louis Cardinals deny player home run celebrations were homages to President Trump’s reaction to assassination attempt - CNN,"The St. Louis Cardinals are denying widespread speculation that their players were paying homage to former President Donald Trump while rounding the bases on Sunday.

After Alec Burleson’s solo home run in the third inning against the Atlanta Braves, the game broadcast showed the right fielder cupping his ear with his left hand and raising his right arm while rounding third base. Some of his teammates mirrored Burleson while celebrating the home run.

The following inning, Cards player Lars Nootbaar homered and, while rounding second, he bent down and mimicked grabbing his ear and then raised his fist upward.

Some on social media claimed the gestures looked similar to how the former president reacted after being led off the rally stage on July 13.

“Definitely not a political statement,” the Cardinals’ designated hitter Matt Carpenter told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch when asked about the similarities following the win.

“That’s off-base here. It’s the furthest thing from a political statement and a little thing (for Burleson). I can understand why everyone is looking for something right now. The St. Louis Cardinals aren’t involved in any kind of political statement,” he told the outlet.

When asked about the celebrations, Cardinals spokesperson Brian Bartow told CNN the salutes were playful references to Burleson’s “DJ/rapper nickname of ‘Biscuits’” as the player was a DJ in college.

CNN asked the Cardinals if Bartow and Nootbaar had a comment.

Both Carpenter and the team said the players had been mimicking a typical DJ’s gestures earlier in the season – before the assassination attempt on Trump.

“It was simply a fun, celebratory exchange between the players and their teammate, who has been knocking the cover off of the ball for us,” Bartow said.

In a separate game on Sunday, broadcast video showed the Tampa Bay Rays’ Taylor Walls celebrating a double versus the New York Yankees with his right arm raised and appearing to mouth, ”Fight! Fight!”

Again, speculation on social media began immediately after asking if Walls was imitating a bloodied Donald Trump’s rallying cry while being led away by secret service agents in Butler, PA.

CNN reached out to Walls through the Rays and has not heard back. When the Tampa Bay Times asked Rays manager Kevin Cash for comment, he is reported to have said, “I was happy he hit a double.”

The Rays told CNN that the team had no further comment to make and pointed to Walls’ quotes in an interview with the Tampa Bay Times on Tuesday.

“I think it’s pretty inspirational when any person, in the blink of an eye, their life could be taken from them,” Walls said. “They don’t really know what’s going on in the heat of the moment.”

“To immediately stand up and show strength, to me, speaks pretty loudly,” Walls added. “Anyone in that situation or that type of event, when it happens, it’s strong. It kind of represents character to me, and something that similarly I feel like I’ve faced those challenges in baseball, but on a much suppressed level.”

Walls added: “I don’t foresee myself doing it again.”",A baseball player in a grey St. Louis Cardinals uniform with a red helmet and catcher's gear is raising his right hand in a fist-like gesture.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BCBF4CBB0>,2024-07-23 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/23/sport/st-louis-cardinals-home-run-celebrations-trump-spt-intl/index.html,['Sports' 'Politics'],[0.85 0.75],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/ab3efe36c2.png
02a473b78b,CBS News,Regretful Wisconsin fake elector says he was tricked into signing phony document claiming Trump won in 2020 - CBS News,"This is an updated version of a story first published on Feb. 18, 2024. The original video can be viewed here.

The month after the presidential election in 2020, Democratic and Republican electors representing the candidate who won the popular vote in their states gathered across the country to formally cast electoral votes for president.

But in seven states that Joe Biden won, Republican electors got together anyway and cast phony votes for Donald Trump. They've become known as fake electors. And according to federal prosecutors, they were part of a plan to overturn the election, orchestrated by pro-Trump attorneys with Trump's support. State criminal charges have been filed against fake electors in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Nevada.

Wisconsin's fake electors haven't been charged, and as we first reported in February, one of them, Andrew Hitt, an attorney and former chairman of the state Republican Party, agreed to sit down with us to explain how he says he and Wisconsin's other GOP electors were tricked by the Trump campaign.

Anderson Cooper: You were head of the Republican Party in Wisconsin. Were you a big Trump supporter?

Andrew Hitt: I worked tirelessly for him. I, you know, day and night--

ANDREW HITT: Let's put it together for the president of the United States one more time!

Andrew Hitt: -- oftentimes phone calls would start by 6:00 in the morning, and wouldn't end until 10:30 at night. I did everything I possibly could.

DONALD TRUMP: The Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman Andrew Hitt.

Andrew Hitt was often singled out by President Trump at rallies in Wisconsin.

DONALD TRUMP: Andrew Hitt!

DONALD TRUMP: Andrew Hitt!

DONALD TRUMP: How we doing, Andrew? Gonna win this state? We gotta win it.

But Trump didn't win in Wisconsin. He lost to Joe Biden by some 20,700 votes. The Trump campaign appealed, challenging more than 200,000 absentee ballots on technical grounds in two Democratic counties.

RUDY GIULIANI: If you count the lawful votes, Trump won Wisconsin by a good margin.

Andrew Hitt: That was false. What he said was false.

Anderson Cooper: The Trump campaign wanted the votes in Dane County and Milwaukee County tossed. Did you support that idea?

Andrew Hitt: - it wasn't something that I was comfortable with.

Anderson Cooper: Dane County and Milwaukee County in Wisconsin-- are the most liberal counties. The majority of the Black population in Wisconsin live in those two counties.

Andrew Hitt: Correct. Correct.

Anderson Cooper: Personally, you did not believe all those absentee ballots should be thrown out?

Andrew Hitt: Well, I voted that way, you know. I voted that way.

Anderson Cooper: You didn't think your own vote should be thrown out?

Andrew Hitt: No.

On Nov. 30, Wisconsin's Democratic Gov. Tony Evers certified Joe Biden's victory — authorizing the state's Democratic electors to gather at the state capitol on Dec. 14 to cast their electoral votes for Biden.

But days earlier Andrew Hitt says he received a call from the Republican National Committee.

Anderson Cooper: What was the reach out to you?

Andrew Hitt: ""Can we get a list of the Wisconsin Republican electors?""

Anderson Cooper: That made you suspicious?

Andrew Hitt: It did.

Andrew Hitt: I was already concerned that they were gonna try to say that the Democratic electors were not proper in Wisconsin because of fraud.

Anderson Cooper: You didn't believe there was any widespread fraud--

Andrew Hitt: No, and I was very involved, obviously, in the election.

Hitt was one of 10 republicans nominated to be an elector if Trump won in Wisconsin. On Dec. 4, he says, he was advised by the state GOP's outside legal counsel to gather the other Republican electors on Dec. 14 at the Capitol and as a contingency, sign a document claiming Trump won the state in case a court overturned the election in Wisconsin.

Anderson Cooper: In case the legal arguments that the Trump team is making actually win in court?

Andrew Hitt: Right. And I remember asking, ""How-- how can this be? That a court overturns the election and, just because we don't meet and fill out this paperwork on the 14th, that Trump would forfeit Wisconsin?"" And the-- legal analysis back was, ""The statute's very clear: The electors have to meet at noon at the Capitol in Wisconsin on December 14th.""

That morning the state Supreme Court — in a 4-3 ruling — rejected the Trump campaign's attempt to throw out more than 200,000 votes. But Andrew Hitt says he and the other Republican electors met anyway to cast fake votes because he'd been told the Trump campaign would appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Kenneth Chesebro, a pro-Trump attorney — who was an alleged architect of the fake electors plan — showed up to watch.

Andrew Hitt: We got specific advice from our lawyers that these documents were meaningless unless a court said they had meaning.

Anderson Cooper: You are deciding to sign this document as an elector, and getting the other electors to sign this document based on a court challenge that you yourself don't believe has legitimacy.

Andrew Hitt: I wouldn't say it doesn't have legitimacy– that's different than not personally agreeing with it.

Anderson Cooper: You personally don't believe that legitimate votes by Wisconsin residents should be tossed out. And yet, you are signing a document in support of a lawsuit which is alleging just that.

Andrew Hitt: And if I didn't do that, and the court did throw out those votes, it would have been solely my fault that Trump wouldn't have won Wisconsin.

DONALD TRUMP: Ah, beautiful kids Andrew. Good. Good. I'm going to blame you Andrew if they don't do it.

Andrew Hitt: Can you imagine the repercussions on myself, my family, if it was me, Andrew Hitt, who prevented Donald Trump from winning Wisconsin.

Anderson Cooper: You're saying you were scared?

Andrew Hitt: Absolutely.

Anderson Cooper: Scared of Trump supporters in your state?

Andrew Hitt: It was not a safe time. If my lawyer is right, and the whole reason Trump loses Wisconsin is because of me, I would be scared to death.

Anderson Cooper: Signing legal documents of such consequence that you don't believe in and you don't believe the underlying reason for the documents, it's-- I mean, it's not exactly a profile in courage.

Andrew Hitt: No.

Anderson Cooper: How do you feel about that now?

Andrew Hitt: I mean, terrible. If I knew what I knew now, I wouldn't have done it. It was kept from us that there was this alternate scheme, alternate motive.

That alleged alternate scheme is a prominent part of special counsel Jack Smith's indictment of the former president.

JACK SMITH: ...charging Donald J. Trump with conspiring to defraud the United States.

According to Smith, what began as a legal strategy in Wisconsin evolved into ""a corrupt plan"" involving six other states as well.

ARIZONA GOP ELECTORS: Donald J. Trump, of the state of Florida. Number of votes, 11.

Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Michigan.

MICHIGAN WOMAN: He said we can't enter.

POLICE: The electors are already here – they've been checked in.

Where some of the fake electors couldn't convince police to let them into the Capitol.

Jack Smith cites this Dec. 6 memo written by Ken Chesebro detailing ways ""the Trump campaign can prevent Biden from amassing 270 electoral votes on January 6…""

Smith alleges the multistate scheme was designed to ""create a fake controversy"" and ""position the vice president… to supplant legitimate electors with [Trump's] fake electors and certify [him] as president.""

By Jan. 4, according to internal emails, some in the Trump campaign were panicking. They believed the fake electors' documents from Michigan and Wisconsin hadn't arrived in Vice President Mike Pence's Senate office.

Anderson Cooper: Your colleague texted you, ""Freakin' Trump idiots want someone to fly original elector papers to the Senate president."" You wrote, ""This is just nuts."" What was nuts about it?

Andrew Hitt: I mean, we have the certification coming on the 6th. Um, how-- how do you not have the paperwork?

Anderson Cooper: I mean you've said that you only went along with this plan to preserve Trump's candidacy in the event of a court ruling. January 4th, just two days before January 6th, did you really think that was still possible?

Andrew Hitt: Well, remember, the Wisconsin Supreme Court had been appealed. And so January 4th, it seemed like, yeah, it's possible that a much more conservative United States Supreme Court could overturn a four-three decision.

To get the paperwork to Washington, they picked Alesha Guenther, then a 23-year-old law school student working part time for Wisconsin's Republican Party.

Alesha Guenther: I was on break from law school, um-- and wanted to make some extra money (laugh) for-- to pay for books and worked for the party for my month off of school. So on January 4th, I got a call from the Executive Director of the Republican Party of Wisconsin, since I was helping out at the time–

Anderson Cooper: What did you think when you got the text?

Alesha Guenther: At first, I didn't know what it was. And then, he followed up and asked, you know, that the Trump campaign wanted these papers flown out to DC because they had gotten lost in the mail.

Guenther says she picked up the papers here at the state party headquarters, and on Jan. 5 flew to Washington.

ALESHA GUENTHER: So this is the email-

She showed us her email chain with Ken Chesebro and the Trump campaign's senior advisor, Mike Roman.

Alesha Guenther: -explaining that I should only give the documents to Ken Chesebro. So, um, and then, they asked me to meet up with him outside the Trump Hotel.

Anderson Cooper: I mean, it sounds very secretive.

Alesha Guenther: Yeah, I thought that that email was pretty odd and dramatic-

Anderson Cooper: And you knew what was happening on January 6th?

Anderson Cooper: -in terms of the-- the certification of the vote.

Alesha Guenther: I don't know if I was very tuned into that. Truly because I thought that a court of law would have need to-- needed to overturn the election for those documents to be used.

Anderson Cooper: Did you know what Chesebro looked like?

Alesha Guenther: So he had actually sent me a selfie.

Anderson Cooper: He-- he sent you a selfie--

Alesha Guenther: Yes.

Anderson Cooper: --so that you would know it was him-

Alesha Guenther: Yeah.

Anderson Cooper: Can I see it?

Alesha Guenther: Yeah.

She still has the photo saved on her phone.

Anderson Cooper: That's-- that's Ken Chesebro.

Alesha Guenther: Uh-huh (affirm).

Anderson Cooper: What did he say to you?

Alesha Guenther: He kind of took a dramatic step back, and looked at me, and said, ""You might have just made history.""

Ken Chesebro told investigators he delivered the Wisconsin documents to Capitol Hill. The next day, on Jan. 6, he can be seen in videos outside the capitol near conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.

ADAM SCHIFF: I now want to look even more deeply at the fake electors scheme...

According to the January 6th Select Committee, an aide to Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson tried to arrange to get the fake electors slates to Vice President Pence.

DONALD TRUMP: And I hope Mike is gonna do the right thing, I hope so. I hope so. Because if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election.

But Pence's aide refused, texting ""do not give that to him,"" according to the committee.

When the Senate chamber had to be evacuated, the real electoral votes in these boxes were taken to safety. and when Congress resumed, they were returned into the House chamber.

MIKE PENCE: Pursuant to Senate concurrent resolution...

Vice President Pence announced the election results and closed the session at 3:44 a.m. Jan. 7.

The Supreme Court ultimately declined to hear the Trump campaign's lawsuit in Wisconsin.

Anderson Cooper: What do you think about Donald Trump continuing to claim that the 2020 election was stolen?

Andrew Hitt: I mean, it wasn't stolen. It wasn't stolen in Wisconsin.

This past December, Andrew Hitt and Wisconsin's other Republican electors settled a civil lawsuit against them by some of the state's Democratic electors. They admitted they signed a document that was ""used as part of an attempt to improperly overturn the 2020 presidential election results.""

Hitt resigned as chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party in August 2021.

He's cooperated with the January 6th committee.

ANDREW HITT, SOT: -using our electors in ways that we weren't told about, um, and we wouldn't have supported.

And, he says, he's also cooperated with federal prosecutors. He maintains he and the other fake electors in Wisconsin were tricked.

Andrew Hitt: Whenever anybody sees our text messages, our emails, our documents, they understand, they know they- their conclusion is we were tricked.The January 6th Committee saw it. Jack Smith specifically in his indictment refers to some of the electors were tricked. That was us.

Anderson Cooper: The former president is known to watch ""60 Minutes."" If he's watching, what would you want to say to him?

Andrew Hitt: I would say that this country needs to move forward. That we need a leader who is-- tackles serious problems and serious issues that this country faces. And we need faith in our institutions again. And the next president of the United States needs to do that.

Anderson Cooper: And in your opinion, that's not him.

Andrew Hitt: That is not him. Correct.

103d0909fb,USA TODAY,"No shade, no water, no breaks: DeSantis' new law threatens Florida outdoor worker health - USA TODAY","NAPLES, Fla. – In South Florida, one of the state's hottest regions, María González works outdoors cleaning planes.

González spends her nights on the airport tarmac doing deep cleans of planes – scrubbing away feces, vomit, animal and human hair and more. Often, she said, airline staff turn off the plane’s air conditioning to save gasoline and money and let it sit on the asphalt, which radiates heat.

“Hay mucho calor, entonces uno sude y sude y sude,” González said. “El calor se duplica ahora porque empiece el verano.”

In English: it gets so hot on the planes as she cleans that she can’t stop sweating. And in the summer? The heat doubles.

“Me siento como mal, como yo me fuera a desmayar,” said González, explaining that her blood pressure drops, and she often feels so ill that she thinks she’s going to faint.

But in April, Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a law banning local municipalities from requiring employers to give heat breaks to outdoor workers such as González, a move DeSantis himself admitted to media was to slap back at one of Florida’s most progressive municipalities, Miami-Dade County, one county south from where she works.

Only Miami-Dade County required employers to provide heat breaks to begin with.

DeSantis' office did not respond to requests for comment.

Still, his decision to get rid of home rule in a state that values small government and is one of the hottest states in the nation took some local officials aback and infuriated outdoor workers and their advocates in some of the hottest regions of the state.

In a warming world, outdoor workers and organizations that protect them say heat and water breaks are a matter of life and death.

“These pro-heat stress bills are really about making sure no one is held accountable if something bad happens to workers…if they get sick or die in extreme heat,” said Florida District Director for Miami-based custodial workers' union SEIU 32BJ Helene O’Brien.

Florida holds municipalities to a heat standard that doesn't exist

Florida House Bill 433 states that cities or towns don’t have a right to require employers to provide heat or shade breaks that the state or federal government doesn’t already require. Absent a state department of worker safety, Florida falls under federal OSHA jurisdiction, which covers most private-sector workers in the state.

However, neither the federal government nor Florida has a heat standard that requires breaks at certain temperatures or sun exposure; advocates say the language is frustratingly vague. Federal workplace safety agency OSHA instead requires breaks ""long enough for workers to recover from the heat."" And while OSHA requires employers to provide water for workers, it doesn’t require that employers give their workers time to drink the water.

The vagaries of the policy have allowed some companies to push the limits – until their workers feel the effects. And the threat of an OSHA investigation doesn't always strike fear into the hearts of management or owners.

Just last summer, one farmworker, 29-year-old Efraín López García, died from heat exposure just hours into his first day on the job at a Homestead fruit farm. It was July 6, and the heat index hit 105 degrees that day, according to the National Weather Service.

The farm labor contractor that employed him, McNeill Labor Management, was found to have exposed workers to direct sunlight and failed to implement protections. Despite its role in López García’s death, the company is now fighting the $27,655 in proposed penalties OSHA imposed upon the business.

González says her employer, HHS Aviation, a cleaning company that contracts for Delta Airlines, has also ignored federal workplace safety standards.

HHS Aviation does, in theory, provide water, González said. But not in practice.

After multiple employees complained about a lack of water, which is against federal law, management purchased and placed a water cooler in the break room two months ago, she said. However, Gonzalez added, there is no water in it – and there has never been.

This leaves González and her coworkers thirsty, even dehydrated. She carries water to work, but doesn’t have a place to store it outside her locker. She can’t carry it with her while cleaning, or waiting for a plane to arrive – she can only drink when she is on break near her locker. She said she was unaware of any other water sources available to the employees.

HHS Aviation disputed González's accounts of the heat and lack of water in her workplace, insisting that employees were allowed to refuse to board a plane and begin cleaning until it was fully cooled, and were trained to stop working when it was unsafe to do so. Additionally, in an email, the company said employees have had access to clean drinking water since operations began Sept. 19, 2023. Too, HHS said, break areas contained bottled water and hallways sported communal water fountains.

""HHS Aviation is committed to the health and safety of our team members, as they are our most valuable asset. We ensure all team members receive access to water, proper training, proper functioning tools and equipment, and designated rest periods,"" wrote marketing vice president Shannon Steck in an email. ""We comply with all Occupational Safety and Health Act regulations, Transportation Safety Administration programs and directives, and applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations.""

After the USA TODAY Network-Florida called HHS Aviation and Delta Airlines about González's complaints, she said management finally filled the water cooler in the break room.

Delta Airlines declined to comment.

Though O'Brien says SEIU 32BJ has filed federal complaints against HHS Aviation on González and her coworkers' behalf, OSHA and other federal agencies can be slow to act. And González and her union point to HB 433 as an example of the state not having workers’ backs, either.

While the federal government is working on adding a heat standard for workers, it won’t be in place for at least two years, if not more – and will likely be killed if Trump wins the November election, worker advocates and heat experts say.

Although Florida has hamstrung its municipalities with this law, O'Brien said laborers still have other options to fight the heat and negotiate better working conditions for themselves: unionization.

“Maybe we need to be bigger at the state level and hold employers accountable for mistreatment of workers,” O’Brien said. “People are going to organize and going to fight … with whatever channels they have.”

Climate change, increasing heat lead to more emergency room visits, deaths

DeSantis signed HB 433 less than a year after an “ocean heat wave” killed off entire coral reefs around Florida, such has never been seen before in recorded history. That tipped over into human exposure, too.

That same year, nearly 2,000 died from heat exhaustion across the U.S. In Florida, 215 people died between 2010 and 2020 from heat, University of Florida data shows.

A 2023 report out of the National Conference of Citizenship found heat-related deaths in Florida shot up by 88% between 2019 and 2022.

Climate change and a warming world is increasing the number of days of extreme heat humans are exposed to. According to NASA, the summer of 2023 was the hottest on record.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Centers for Disease Control found in 2024 that emergency visits for heat-related illnesses surged in 2023, especially among men and adults aged 18 to 64: or, as University of Connecticut’s Korey Stringer Institute CEO Douglas Casa noted, the demographic most likely to work outdoors.

Casa studies the effects of heat on the human body. His heat lab has been the recipient of more than a dozen Department of Defense grants in recent years, researching cooling strategies, and physiological and clinical implications of heat stress.

Heat exposure-related illnesses and deaths are almost certainly undercounted, as discrete heat-exposure events and a lifetime of chronic dehydration can lead to shortened lifespans from kidney and heart disease, Casa said.

The effects of heat on outdoor workers may be even more serious than the current science shows, Casa said.

""Laborers are between ages 30 to 70, and they don’t have a two-hour practice or game; they’re doing 12-hour shifts and they are on medications and have other problems,"" Casa said. ""And we take care of them the least amount. Laborers have been kept out of the loop in the long term.""

DeSantis kills home rule on heat regulations with new law

Florida House Bill 433, which DeSantis signed into law in April, prohibits local governments from requiring shade or water breaks for outdoor workers, or even giving preference to employers based on their heat exposure requirements.

But only one county of 67 – Miami-Dade County – had such a requirement already in place. The county had recently passed an ordinance requiring employers to give outdoor workers 10-minute breaks in the shade for every two hours worked outside.

Miami-Dade's ""heat officer,"" Jane Gilbert, is charged with designing mitigation strategies to help protect workers from the heat, some of which this law effectively killed.

Still, Gilbert said in a statement, her staff members have not given up.

She cited her office's work expanding tree canopy, designating cooling sites during heat season, installing nearly 2,000 air conditioning units in public housing and providing heat safety trainings for personnel who work with homeless residents as examples of her continued dedication to combating heat.

“We will continue to do everything within our power to ensure the people of Miami-Dade County are safe from extreme heat,"" Gilbert said.

But in the absence of the stick, there still exists the carrot.

Governments can put all sorts of incentives in place to protect workers, such as fast-tracking permits, reducing taxes or providing grants to companies that commit to protecting workers on the job, said Kathy Baughman McLeod, CEO and founder of gender and climate-focused organization Climate Resilience for All.

Baughman McLeod has worked in climate resiliency for roughly 25 years, including at the Arsht-Rockefeller Resilience Center, Bank of America, The Nature Conservancy and, finally, at the Office of the State of Florida’s Chief Financial Officer. The latter she credits with shaping her career, as well as her understanding of government and conservation.

Baughman McLeod added that local governments interested in improving their response to intensifying heat should also work to improve data around heat's effects on health and community, as it is poorly understood.

""Heat is killing more people than any other hazard,"" said Baughman McLeod. ""It's silent and invisible. This law ... is the total opposite direction of where we should be going.""

Elsewhere, local government officials were discomfited by the passage of the law.

In conservative Collier County, two hours due west of Miami and subject to similar temperatures, Commissioner Bill McDaniel wondered at why the law got rid of home rule on a subject that just one county in Florida had passed restrictions on. It felt like an unnecessary overreach, he said, though he added he felt the government had no place between an employer and its employee.

“I have to say two things: I don’t like state mandates on local government, ever,” McDaniel said. But, he added, “I believe the onus is on the employer and not the government to mandate things that good employers should be doing anyway.""

“Two, I know that 99% of employers that employ people that work outside already take care of those people. They cherish their employees.”

If they don’t, he said, they won’t have any left.

Grower: Shade, electrolyte-infused water and regular breaks improve farmworker performance

As McDaniel suspected, at least some employers already offer shade and water breaks to their outdoor workers and they intend to continue the practice, such as Collier County's Immokalee-based Pacific Tomato Growers owner and Sunripe Certified Brands CEO Jon Esformes.

Farm workers labor outdoors for hours at a time. The work they do, often under the hot sun, creates its own sort of heat. Their bodies then must work not only to keep up with the work they are performing, but must also work to cool themselves, as well.

Farmworkers are also regularly paid piece rates instead of by the hour, incentivizing workers to work to the point of exhaustion or dehydration.

But not on Esformes’ farm.

Esformes was the first grower to sign on to the Coalition of Immokalee Workers' Fair Food Program in the 1990s, which requires employers to provide heat breaks for their workers. He says providing shade and water breaks for workers is an important part of farming in Florida and has testified in Tallahassee to that effect.

“Agriculture is a big dark secret in North America in terms of worker relationships,” Esformes said. “Heat stress for agricultural workers has long been a problem.”

Esformes provides his workers with shaded places to sit, electrolyte-infused water, mandatory and voluntary breaks, and even sends workers home for the day when the “feels-like” temperature is too hot. He told the USA TODAY Network-Florida the Fair Food Program was an important part of moving into the future as a grower and honoring his employees’ rights as humans.

“No worker should risk their life in dangerous heat without relief,” Coalition of Immokalee Workers representative and farmworker Gerardo Reyes Chaves said in a statement.

Once he began offering extra heat protections to his workers, Esformes said he realized this was also a great business decision. His workers’ productivity – and consequently his farming operation’s productivity – increased, and their physical and cognitive function remained higher as their bodies stayed cooler.

Esformes questioned the rationale behind passing HB 433. Temperatures vary so widely across the state that it would behoove the state to allow local municipalities to pass their own requirements to avoid over-legislating across the state, Esformes said.

“I don’t know that it would be wrong for one part of the state to have a different protocol than the other,” Esformes said. “But I do believe that when it comes to worker protections, few states do enough to address … heat illness for outdoor workers.""

The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services did not respond to requests for comment.

United Farm Workers, a labor organization for farmworkers, has branches in California, Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Texas and Michigan. The organization has pushed for, and seen implemented, heat regulations in several of those states, including California and Oregon, though Texas has rolled back heat protections for workers in recent months.

Elizabeth Strater, the UFW director of strategic campaigns, said the heat protections in California and Oregon improved farmworkers' lives and health. After implementing heat rules in California, she said, data showed that despite increasingly intense heat waves, the rate of kidney disease in farm workers declined dramatically.

“It isn’t just about getting up and not dying that day,"" Strater said. ""It’s about how the nature of that work shortens your life.”

González, who spends her working hours doing deep cleans of Delta’s planes on a South Florida tarmac, said she was livid about HB 433. She demanded that lawmakers think more about the people they represent before passing and signing these bills.

González paused and thought over her words for a moment.

""Estoy indignada,"" she said. I'm indignant. They should take better care of us. Have some respect for us.

“Deberían tomarse más cura de nosotros, más cuidado. Y creo que el respeto, también. El respeto a la persona.""

71dfb6d3fe,USA TODAY,"Exclusive: Sinaloa Cartel leader Ismael Zambada kidnapped, flown to the US, lawyer says - USA TODAY","SANTA TERESA, N.M. – Two ""VIPs"" were set to arrive at a sleepy airport in the desert near the U.S.-Mexico border.

That's all airport manager Bill Provance knew Thursday before the twin-engine plane touched down and law enforcement swarmed the tarmac. The ""VIPs"" turned out to be Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, one of the world's most elusive and dangerous drug kingpins, and Joaquin Guzman Lopez, the son of Zambada's partner-in-crime, Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman.

""I went out to see what was going on,"" said Provance, manager of the Doña Ana County International Jetport. The federal agents gave him a vague response. ""They said, 'We've got VIPs coming in.'""

Former law enforcement officials involved in the decadeslong hunt for Zambada say his arrest Thursday is as monumental as the 2016 capture of ""El Chapo"" Guzman given his role as the chief strategic thinker of what is universally considered to be the world’s most powerful organized crime organization.

But Zambada’s arrest is also shaping up to be a story of epic betrayal by one of Chapo's sons, one key player told USA TODAY − and a direct result of their business strategy to flood the U.S. with deadly fentanyl over the past decade. That galvanized the U.S. government to launch a scorched-earth campaign to go after them.

Media reports initially suggested the two were arrested in El Paso, Texas, and speculated that Guzman Lopez tricked Zambada into going for a plane ride to look at real estate on the Mexico side of the border before crossing into the United States. But law enforcement actually took the men into custody on the tarmac of this small airport in New Mexico where El Paso's wealthiest residents keep their private planes.

And late Saturday, criminal defense lawyer Frank Perez of Dallas told USA TODAY that his client, Zambada, did not get on the Beechcraft plane of his own accord, but as part of a deal by the son of El Chapo to negotiate a better plea agreement with U.S. authorities for himself.

""My client neither surrendered nor negotiated any terms with the U.S. government,"" Perez said in a statement given exclusively to USA TODAY. ""Joaquin Guzman Lopez forcibly kidnapped my client. He was ambushed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed by six men in military uniforms and Joaquin.""

After that, Perez said, Zambada's ""legs were tied, and a black bag was placed over his head. He was then thrown into the back of a pickup truck and taken to a landing strip. There, he was forced onto a plane, his legs tied to the seat by Joaquin, and brought to the U.S. against his will. The only people on the plane were the pilot, Joaquin and my client.""

In an interview, Perez said Zambada was meeting someone for breakfast and that instead of that person showing up, Guzman Lopez and his aides appeared and assaulted him.

That caught Zambada and his small security detail off guard, and he was tied up, thrown in the back of a pickup truck and driven about 20 minutes away to an airport, where he was put on the plane with Guzmán López, Perez said.

“He was the one who set up the meeting” to get Zambada to come out, Perez said of Guzman Lopez. He said the son of El Chapo then personally tied his father’s longtime partner to the chair of the aircraft so he couldn’t escape.

Jeffrey Lichtman, a lawyer representing Guzman Lopez, had no comment on Perez's specific claims. ""He's free to employ any defense he sees fit to defend against the charges,"" Lichtman told USA TODAY.

Neither Zambada nor Guzman Lopez have been convicted of any crimes in the U.S. and the Justice Department, per policy, says the charges are only allegations and that they are innocent until proven guilty. The Justice Department did not immediately return a request for comment.

Flying in from the south

The plane with a royal blue tail flew in from the south and then parked in front of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection building at the airport, according to a local pilot who watched from the tarmac.

It was a hot, clear afternoon. On board the aircraft, Zambada would have been able to see the rusted steel border fence cutting through orange sand below as the plane entered U.S. airspace. Sprawling twin plants lay between the border fence and the airport, warehouses and factories connected to industrial manufacturing in Ciudad Juárez across the border.

The local pilot saw one man, who he later understood to be Guzman Lopez, deplane first.

""He shook all the hands of the law enforcement,"" said the pilot, who asked his name be withheld out of fear of retribution by organized crime. The man he later understood to be Zambada ""remained on board. Obviously, he came out later and was calmly taken into custody.""

Inside the plane, there were snacks including chips and Gansitos, Mexican vanilla cakes covered in chocolate. There also appeared to be unused plastic zip ties in a convenience store bag.

Many details of the arrest of the two Sinaloa Cartel leaders remain steeped in secrecy.

But already, the case has caused reverberations from Washington to the border and deep into Mexico, where the government of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said it was not involved.

‘The brains’ behind the Sinaloa Cartel’s rise – and the American fentanyl crisis

Current and former federal authorities say Zambada was the brains and the elder Guzman, now locked up in a U.S. federal prison, was the muscle of one of the deadliest worldwide fentanyl trafficking organizations, the Sinaloa Cartel.

""The cartel’s generating billions of dollars from fentanyl and killing hundreds of thousands of Americans is, to me, what ultimately brought these guys down,"" said former Drug Enforcement Administration Chief of Operations Ray Donovan, who led the government-wide effort against Sinaloa Cartel until his retirement in April 2023.

""Chapo was more the brawn of the cartel and Mayo was the brains, the methodic business-minded leader who generated the revenues,"" Donovan told USA TODAY on Saturday. ""The Sinaloa cartel would not be as powerful as it became if not for El Mayo.""

Zambada eluded U.S. and Mexican authorities for decades. Even in the era of cellphone cameras and social media, only one photograph had ever emerged – until Thursday. The Mexican government released a photo provided by the U.S., according to Mexican officials, of Zambada with dark hair and a mustache, wearing a blue polo-style with the word ""Boss"" embroidered on the chest.

Now that Zambada is in U.S. custody, it is likely to start another bloody power struggle between factions within the cartel, according to Donovan and others familiar with its operations.

""Now that their leader is gone, Ivan Guzman, Chapo's oldest son, is a young, hard-charging violent leader and he's going to want to consolidate power,"" Donovan said. ""And either Mayo's faction of the cartel is going to fall in line or they're going to fight.""

A cat-and-mouse hunt for Ismael Zambada

Former federal law enforcement officials familiar with the cat-and-mouse hunt for Zambada in recent decades said he and his family already had been experiencing increasing internal tensions with the Sinaloa Cartel faction led by El Chapo and his sons, especially over the lethal drug fentanyl.

El Mayo, El Chapo and a third man known as El Azul, or Juan José Esparragoza Moreno, launched what is now known as the Sinaloa Cartel after being brought together by major trafficker Felix Gallardo, who headed the feared Pacific Cartel in the 1980s.

The three branched off from Gallardo and created the Federation, which transformed into the Sinaloa Cartel as it became a global juggernaut that grew, manufactured and sold much of the marijuana, cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine headed for the United States.

Zambada was responsible for much of the business growth of the organization, remaining behind the scenes while El Chapo became the public and more violent face of Sinaloa. Zambada, according to Donovan, “was very much about the business, generating revenue” even as El Chapo’s violence made him the stuff of Mexican folklore.

As the fentanyl epidemic reached crisis proportions by 2017, federal law enforcement agencies ramped up their efforts to neutralize those responsible for it. That effort was led by the DEA and its multiagency Special Operations Division nerve center in Chantilly, Virginia, but the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security also played crucial roles, Donovan said.

“We increased the reward money. We put in a whole-of-government approach to trying to go after these guys. A lot more resources and efforts into zeroing in on them,” Donovan said.

Turning up the heat, gaining the cooperation of insiders

One of the first big breaks came in the case of Zambada’s son, Jesús Vicente Zambada Niebla, or ""El Vicentillo"", who was arrested in Mexico City in 2009. Eager to minimize his time in U.S. prisons, he began cooperating with authorities and testified against fellow members of the Sinaloa Cartel.

The younger Zambada testified against El Chapo at the historic trial in New York that led to his conviction and long prison sentence, said Derek Maltz, the former head of DEA’s Special Operations Division.

In recent years, as U.S. law enforcement agents continued to hunt for El Vicentillo’s father, they also focused intensively on the Chapitos, the sons of El Chapo who inherited much of the control of the Sinaloa Cartel empire from their father – including the U.S.-bound fentanyl trafficking business.

Another big break came with the capture of one of the Chapitos, Ovidio Guzmán. He was initially arrested by Mexican authorities in 2019 but later released after heavily armed Sinaloa gunmen engaged in violent clashes with Mexican authorities. Once captured again in 2023 and extradited to the United States to face trial, he too allegedly began cooperating.

And as U.S. law enforcement authorities continued to extract information and intelligence from his brother Ovidio, they also ramped up back-channel negotiations with Guzmán López, The New York Times reported, citing three people familiar with his situation.

""It's very clear, based on my knowledge and experience, that they were developing a plan to get not only the kid, Joaquin Junior, to surrender, as part of Ovidio's good faith cooperation with the government, but then you have Joaquin Junior down there also figuring that I can come up with a plan to take Mayo down too,"" Maltz told USA TODAY.

The lure of a potential deal

Officials at the FBI and Department of Homeland Security declined to comment when reached by USA TODAY about the circumstances of what led to the Thursday arrests, and Attorney General Merrick Garland did not mention them in his videotaped statement on the case.

“Both men are facing multiple charges in the United States for leading the cartel’s criminal operations, including its deadly drug manufacturing and trafficking networks,” Garland said before vowing to continue to go after their associates who continue to traffick metric tons worth of the lethal synthetic opioid across the southern border. “The Justice Department will not rest until every single cartel leader, member and associate responsible for poisoning our communities is held accountable.”

But two current and two former U.S. officials familiar with the situation told Reuters – which first reported the arrests – that Guzman Lopez planned to give himself up upon landing and duped Zambada into getting on the plane under the pretense of looking at real estate in northern Mexico near the border.

Guzman Lopez had engaged in lengthy surrender talks with U.S. authorities, as is often the case in these protracted efforts to capture them, Reuters said, but authorities were not hopeful that El Chapo's son actually would surrender. They were caught unaware when Guzman Lopez sent a last-minute message saying he would be flying to the U.S. airport, Reuters reported, and bringing the infamous Zambada with him.

""El Mayo was the cherry on top,"" one U.S. official, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the arrests, told Reuters. ""It wasn't expected at all.""

That set off a mad scramble as U.S. agents from the FBI and DHS investigative arm, Homeland Security Investigations or HSI, raced to the scene just in time for the tiny Beechcraft King Air plane to land on the runway Thursday afternoon.

Provance, the airport manager watched the scene through the floor-to-ceiling windows of his corner office. ""The plane landed, and that was it.""

There was no gunfight, no drama and no resistance.

Law enforcement officers wrapped a chain around the propeller, and the plane remained parked in the same spot on the tarmac for more than 24 hours before it was ferried into a hangar.

Border residents, curious about the notorious Mexican drug lord, parked at the county's War Eagles Air Museum. They walked up to a chain link fence for a glimpse of the plane Zambada came in on.

282fd793c5,Financial Times,Kamala Harris channels Beyoncé to counter Trump’s ‘radical’ attack - Financial Times,"Kamala Harris has released the first digital video of her White House bid, as her campaign team races to define her image as a moderate centrist in the face of a barrage of attacks from Donald Trump and Republican critics depicting her as a radical liberal.

The video shows Harris at her first big rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, this week, combined with images of Trump and his running mate JD Vance to lay out the contrast Democrats see in the November election.

“There are some people who think we should be a country of chaos, of fear, of hate. But us, we choose something different, we choose freedom,” says Harris in the video, which includes music from Beyoncé’s hit song “Freedom”.

“The freedom not just to get by, but get ahead. The freedom to be safe from gun violence. The freedom to make decisions about your own body,” she adds, in a reference to abortion, a core issue for Democrats as they accuse Republicans of restricting women’s reproductive rights.

The video on Thursday comes as Trump and Republicans have launched early broadsides against Harris, a former California prosecutor and US senator, seeking to portray her as hyper-liberal on issues ranging from immigration to crime and energy policies.

Joe Biden’s decision to leave the White House race has forced the Trump campaign to pivot its strategy quickly from attacks on the president’s physical and mental fitness to criticism of Harris.

Having massively increased its fundraising in recent months, the Trump campaign is also in a position to launch an early advertising blitz across the swing-states in an effort to define her in the mind of the voters that will decide the election.

At a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina on Wednesday night, Trump launched his own frontal assault on Harris, giving her the nickname “Lyin’ Kamala Harris” and calling her a “radical crazy person”.

“You’ve been terrible at everything you’ve done,” Trump told his new opponent for the White House, as he spoke to his supporters. “You’re ultra liberal. And we don’t want you here. We don’t want you anywhere. Kamala. You’re fired.”

In the battleground states, Dave McCormick, a Republican candidate for Senate, released his own advert this week attacking Democratic incumbent Bob Casey for backing Harris. McCormick called Harris the “most liberal nominee in US history”.

While Republicans are trying to label Harris as a proponent of ultraliberal policies, the vice-president has been a mainstream Democrat, who previously attracted criticism from the left for her past as a prosecutor.

The Biden administration has also drawn criticism from the progressive Democrats for its support for Israel’s war in Gaza and its recent restrictions on immigration through the US’s southern border.

Harris did not attend Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to the US Congress on Wednesday evening.

While Harris’s candidacy has energised the Democratic party’s base, her biggest challenge will be to attract swing and independent voters to her side over Trump.

As Harris launched her first campaign video, Priorities USA, a Democratic group backing her White House bid, released a new digital advert aimed at swing state voters that contrasts Harris’s defence of abortion rights with that of Trump, who in 2022 appointed three of the Supreme Court justices who overturned the constitutional right to end a pregnancy.

“The thought of Donald Trump being president again scares me,” says a woman featured in the ad, who had been denied an abortion even though her doctor had said the “baby was not compatible with life”.",A woman in a beige blazer waves to the crowd with the seal of the United States in the background.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA2EC9BA0>,2024-07-25 14:53:05.935000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/cf730038-dc9b-4b75-8f17-e279df397171,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.8 ],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/282fd793c5.png
769fd271cc,Global News,"‘Save me, save me’: Witness recounts coming to aid of man set on fire in Surrey - Global News","As Surrey RCMP continue their hunt for the suspect in a disturbing attack on a local business owner Friday, a witness is sharing his account of what happened.

Zeeshan Wahla, a mechanical engineer and the BC Conservative candidate for Surrey City Centre, was inside SNS Currency Exchange in Whalley when Rahat Rao was doused in accelerant and set on fire.

“I tried my level best to save his life,” Wahla told Global News in an interview Tuesday.

Wahla said he was campaigning in the area near Surrey Central Station on August 2, and waiting to meet with Rao when he saw the business owner enter a back room with a man who appeared to be a client.

Rao, Wahla said, had told him he had to take care of a client before their meeting.

“After 30 to 40 seconds, I saw Rahat coming out on fire,” Wahla said.

Wahla said he ran after Rao, grabbing a large blanket from a homeless man who happened to be outside the business.

“I saw Rahat, he was out on the street screaming,” recalled Wahla. “I got the blanket and he was talking to me as well, ‘Save me, save me,’ and I said don’t worry, I’m trying my level best try to put the fire out.”

Together with a female bystander, Wahla said they tried to put the flames out.

“He (Rao) was ripping the clothes off and it was a very terrible situation,” said Wahla.

Wahla said he stayed with Rao until police and first responders arrived to give him oxygen before transporting him to hospital.

Family friends have told Global News that Rao, one of two directors with Canadian Muslim Advocacy International and a member of the local Canadian-Pakistani community, remains in intensive care as he recovers from third-degree burns to over half of his body.

Surrey RCMP said they are conducting a full and thorough investigation to determine why Rao was attacked and who is responsible.

“At this time, we’re still investigating and gathering all the evidence as to why this incident occurred and what the motive was behind this incident,” Const. Parmbir Kahlon told Global News Tuesday.

Apprehending the suspect, who remains at large, is among the detachment’s top priorities.

Investigators are looking for a man between the ages of 25 and 30 with a moustache who was wearing black pants, a grey hoodie with black arms and a green baseball cap with ‘Cariboo’ written on it.

e24f873d48,ABC News,"Man guns down 3 women, including his mom, in separate shootings within 1 hour: Florida police - ABC News","A man is dead after allegedly going on a ""killing spree,"" gunning down three women -- his mother, his cousin and an ex-girlfriend's new partner -- in separate shootings in Florida, authorities said.

Before the Monday night shootings unfolded, the suspect, 28-year-old Javontee Brice, first went to an apartment in Palmetto where his sister and ex-girlfriend were located, Manatee County Sheriff Rick Wells said at a news conference.

""He looked at the ex-girlfriend and said, 'I have to kill you.' Somehow the sister was able to talk him down and talk him out of him shooting this ex-girlfriend,"" Wells said. ""She later told investigators that he was acting very strange.""

Wells then drove to a Motel 6 in Bradenton where his mother, his two young sisters and the mother's boyfriend were staying, the sheriff said.

Around 9:15 p.m., ""he walked into that hotel room, looked at the mother and said, 'I'm sorry,'"" Wells said.

""She asked, 'What did you do?' And he shoots her three times in front of the boyfriend and these two innocent young juveniles,"" Wells said.

Brice then drove to a house in Palmetto where one of his cousins was at a cookout, the sheriff said. Wells allegedly shot his cousin as she was getting into her car to leave, around 9:40 p.m., the sheriff said. The 29-year-old cousin died about one hour later, the sheriff said.

Brice then drove to a home in Bradenton, where another ex-girlfriend lived with her new partner, the sheriff said. At about 10:04 p.m., Brice allegedly shot and killed the new partner, Wells said.

The sheriff's office said it issued a statewide ""Be On the Lookout"" bulletin for Brice's car, which was later tracked to Hamilton County, near the state line with Georgia.

Authorities learned Brice ""possibly has another ex-girlfriend"" in Georgia and may have been driving there to kill her, Wells said.

When police pulled Brice over at about 1:30 a.m. Tuesday in Hamilton County, Brice got out of the car and started firing at officers, Wells said.

The officers return fire, fatally shooting Brice, Wells said.

A woman was with Brice when he was pulled over and she is being interviewed, the sheriff said.

""We don't know her relation to him at this point, but she was in the car when the shootout took place,"" Wells said.

Brice's family is ""devastated"" by the slayings of the mother and cousin, Wells said, but investigators are looking to interview the relatives to determine what Brice ""may have been going through the last few days.""

""He seemed to have an agenda; he knew exactly who he wanted to kill and he did not have a hard time locating them,"" Wells said.

""We don't know what set this man off. We don't know why he chose to kill his loved ones,"" the sheriff added. ""We may never know, but we're going to continue to investigate.""",A man in a green uniform holds a framed photo of a man with a beard and dreadlocks.

0b140c5988,The Associated Press,Trump questions acceptance of transgender people as he courts his base at Moms for Liberty gathering - The Associated Press,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump lamented the growing acceptance of transgender Americans Friday in an appearance at the annual gathering of Moms for Liberty, a national nonprofit that has spearheaded efforts to get mentions of LGBTQ+ identity and structural racism out of K-12 classrooms.

Trump said transgender women should not be allowed to play in women’s sports and said access to gender-affirming health care should be restricted. He also lashed out at critics who have accused him of using Arlington National Cemetery for a campaign photo op.

But he largely stuck to his favorite topics during an hourlong “fireside chat” in Washington, where he lashed out at President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, deplored illegal immigration and reminisced about his parents’ marriage, his path to being the reality television star of “The Apprentice” and the debate that ended Biden’s reelection campaign.

“Our country is being poisoned. And your schools and your children are suffering greatly because they’re going into the classrooms and taking disease, and they don’t even speak English,” Trump said of immigrants crossing the border illegally. “It’s crazy.”

Trump said school boards have become “like dictatorships” hostile to the desires of parents, echoing conservative frustration that bubbled over in public meetings during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“I’m for parental rights all the way. I don’t even understand the concept of not being,” Trump said.

Trump did not address the U.S. Army’s allegation that an Arlington National Cemetery official was “ abruptly pushed aside ” in an altercation with Trump aides this week while he visited the graves of servicemembers killed in a terrorist attack during the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. But he said he’s gotten to know the families and they asked to take a photo with him.

Photos of the cemetery visit showed Trump standing by the graves and flashing a thumbs-up sign next to relatives of Staff Sgt. Darin Taylor Hoover and Sgt. Nicole Gee.

“These people are devastated,” Trump said Friday. “These people can never ever be the same. And it was all because of Biden.”

Trump entered a hotel ballroom in Washington as he does at his signature rallies, standing and soaking up applause for the entirety of Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless the USA,” followed by chants of “Trump, Trump, Trump.” Seated onstage with the co-founder of Moms for Liberty, Tiffany Justice, he shared some of his favorite stories that are mainstays at his rallies, bouncing from topic to topic in a style that has become familiar to his supporters.

The former president sought to shore up support and enthusiasm among a major part of his base. The bulk of Moms for Liberty’s 130,000-plus members are conservatives who agree with him that parents should have more say in public education and that racial equity programs and transgender accommodations don’t belong in schools.

Yet Trump also runs the risk of alienating some moderate voters, many of whom see Moms for Liberty’s activism as too extreme to be legitimized by a presidential nominee.

A year ago, Moms for Liberty was viewed by many as a rising power player in conservative politics that could be pivotal in supporting the Republican ticket. The group’s membership skyrocketed after its launch in 2021, fueled by parents protesting mandatory masking for students and remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.

But in the last several months, a series of embarrassing scandals and underwhelming performances during local elections have called Moms for Liberty’s influence into question.

The group also has voiced support for Project 2025, a detailed and controversial playbook for the next conservative presidency from which Trump has repeatedly tried to distance himself.

Moms for Liberty serves on the advisory board for Project 2025, and the author of the document’s education chapter taught a “strategy session” at the group’s Friday gathering.

The negative perceptions about Moms for Liberty around the country could increase the potential liability for Trump as he sits down with co-founder Justice, said University of Central Florida political science professor Aubrey Jewett.

“It certainly helps him rally his base,” Jewett said. “But will that be enough to outdo the backlash?”

In an interview before the event, Justice disputed the idea that her group’s influence is waning, pointing to the 60% of Moms for Liberty-backed candidates who won their recent races in the Florida primaries.

That’s “a really big deal,” she said, especially considering that many of the school board hopefuls the group endorses are first-time candidates running against incumbents. She also noted three Moms for Liberty members who won Florida House primaries, showing the group’s reach into other political offices.

Trump spent several minutes of the fireside chat discussing transgender issues in adult sports, including the recent Olympics, where vitriol erupted over a female boxer who was widely misidentified as transgender.

Trump falsely claimed Algerian boxer Imane Khelif “transitioned” and said he wouldn’t want to fight her. Khelif was assigned female at birth.

Trump’s education proposals include promoting school choice, giving parents more say in education and awarding funding preference to states and school districts that abolish teacher tenure, financially reward good teachers and allow parents to directly elect school principals.

He also has called for terminating the Department of Education, barring transgender athletes from playing in girls’ sports, and cutting funding from any schools pushing “inappropriate racial, sexual or political content” and from schools with vaccine mandates. He offered no new education proposals Friday.

The event took on a party-like atmosphere as the group awaited Trump’s arrival to a hotel ballroom in Washington. Donning shirts with messages like “Moms for Trump” and “We don’t co-parent with the government,” attendees at the group’s annual gathering ate buffet desserts, drank beer and cheered to a cover band playing country hits.

Vice President Kamala Harris has criticized her Republican opponent for his threats to dismantle the Department of Education. She also has spoken out against efforts to restrict classroom content related to race.

Democrats have lauded her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, for an executive order he signed protecting the rights of LGBTQ people to receive gender-affirming health care in his state. Republicans, including Trump, have lambasted him for it.

During a campaign stop earlier Friday in Johnstown in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, Trump offered extensive criticism of the media for what he called unfavorable coverage and singled out CNN for its interview with Harris and Walz on Thursday.

Moments later, a man rushed the media area and made it over a bike rack barrier and close to a riser where television reporters were watching the rally. Private security pushed him back, and the man was eventually subdued by law enforcement using a Taser.

Trump at first said of the man, “he’s on our side,” but it’s not clear what his intent was. As police led the man away, the former president declared, “Is there anywhere that’s more fun to be than a Trump rally?”

cb7dab749f,CBC News,Destroying Michael Cohen: Trump team sets off on mission at trial - CBC News,"Donald Trump's legal team set out to demolish the credibility of the key witness in his criminal trial, assailing Michael Cohen as an untrustworthy, ill-tempered, revenge-hungry narrator.

For two days, a jury heard Cohen methodically build up elements of the case against his former boss and confidant.

But just seconds into the cross-examination Tuesday, the defence's objective became clear: Tear down the witness in the jury's eyes.

The grilling started with a fiery opening. Cohen was accused of making clear his desire to see Trump imprisoned, in profane public tirades against the defendant and his legal team.

Trump lawyer Todd Blanche began by observing that he'd never even met Cohen, and added, ""You went on TikTok and called me a crying little shit.""

""That sounds like something I would say,"" Cohen replied.

After some aggressive back-and-forth, Cohen admitted he wanted to see Trump convicted.

The court heard that he'd said so on his podcast — that he'd yearned aloud to see Trump in handcuffs and to do a perp walk. He'd even sold a T-shirt depicting Trump behind bars.

Blanche also asked about his public references to Trump as a ""dictator-douchebag,"" a ""boorish, cartoon misogynist"" and ""a Cheeto-dusted cartoon villain.""

The defence cast Cohen's turn against Trump as motivated by fame, by sales of books that netted Cohen about $3.4 million US, and a failed attempt to avoid prison several years ago.

The trial, which is entering its final stages, is adjourned through Thursday.

Pre-emptive grilling from prosecutors

Cohen was also subjected to a sustained grilling — from his own side.

It was prosecutors who subpoenaed him as their witness, with his detailed first-hand knowledge of Trump's alleged cover-up of hush-money payments to a porn star.

They launched a pre-emptive strike earlier on Tuesday, battering him with questions about his prolific history of lying and criminal convictions for fraud.

It was an attempt to prepare the jury for the withering cross-examination Cohen is now facing as Trump's defence team took over.

The attacks were foreshadowed by the appearance of numerous Republicans at the Manhattan courthouse this week: the governor of North Dakota, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and other members of Congress have made the political pilgrimage.

With Trump under a gag order, forbidden from attacking witnesses, several of these people rumoured for potential roles in the next administration came as part of his entourage, to disparage the case and the witness.

'I regret doing things for him that I should not have'

The prosecution's final questions for Cohen sought to present his past lies in the light most favourable to the case: As having been done exclusively for Trump.

In his second day on the witness stand, Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer expressed regret for years of behaviour that he said cost his reputation, his freedom, his finances and his family.

""I regret doing things for him that I should not have. Lying. Bullying people,"" said Cohen, who spent 10 years working for Trump.

""It violated my moral compass.""

With that, the prosecution completed its questioning. As court broke for lunch Tuesday, prosecutor Susan Hoffinger said, ""Nothing further, your honour.""

That was after she'd gotten Cohen's testimony bolstering the key facts of the felony case: That Trump knew about the hush-money payments to Stormy Daniels, that he in fact had ordered them and approved a cover-up, and that it was done primarily for electoral purposes in 2016.

She had Cohen walk her through what he called false financial statements — invoices claiming he was being paid a legal retainer; Trump company statements mentioning legal expenses; and cheques signed by Trump, totalling $420,000 US, which Cohen said included a $130,000 US reimbursement for his own payment to cover up a sex scandal.

How the Cohen-Trump relationship soured

Cohen described how his relationship with Trump started to break down. After the FBI raided Cohen's home in 2018, he said he spoke to Trump that day — and never again.

He said he felt various forms of pressure from Trump not to flip on him. This came in the form of public tweets from the president, and in private overtures from a lawyer who offered to discreetly convey messages to and from the president, through their mutual friend, Rudy Giuliani.

Cohen read into the court record one letter from that lawyer, Robert Costello, which said, ""You are loved.… Sleep well tonight. You have friends in high places.""

Cohen said he understood that to refer to then-president Trump, and called it reassuring that the man running the Justice Department was in his corner.

Months later, reports surfaced that Cohen was considering testifying before the Mueller probe into Russian collusion in 2016. His relationship soured with Costello, who again sent messages urging him not to flip on Trump.

At that point, in the spring of 2018, he said his family persuaded him to stop lying for Trump. He made a promise to them: ""I would not lie for President Trump any longer.""

He subsequently pleaded guilty to tax fraud, lying to Congress, and to a federal election finance crime, in a payoff to another Trump paramour peripherally related to this case.

There came the pre-emptive move from Hoffinger who, in an attempt to inoculate her witness, asked him repeatedly about all these misdeeds and — crucially — about why he committed them.

Cohen's reply: ""For the benefit of Donald J. Trump.""

His lies for Trump included his one-time insistence that he had paid Daniels out of generosity for a friend, not expecting a refund; his lies to Congress denying Trump was trying to get a skyscraper built in Moscow during the 2016 election; and a misleading 2018 letter to the Federal Election Commission saying Trump had never refunded him for the Daniels payments.

What Cohen, and the prosecution, left out, is that some of his criminal charges were unrelated to Trump — including tax-evasion charges involving Cohen's taxi business.

Visitors to the courthouse

Outside the courthouse Tuesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson referred to Cohen as a known liar. Others rumoured to be candidates for roles in a future Trump administration came to the courtroom, and did interviews and rage-tweeted against the case.

They've included lawmakers Byron Donalds, Nicole Malliotakis and J.D. Vance, former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, and Doug Burgum, the sitting governor of North Dakota. They were seated in the front row of the courthouse, with Trump's son Eric.

Trump, for his part, has shown little emotion inside the courthouse. In fact, for many minutes Tuesday, his eyes were closed, with his head was titled sideways, as if sleeping — a common occurrence throughout the trial.

But the cross-examination appeared to lift Republicans' spirits.

In the second row of the gallery, congressman Byron Donalds giggled with Trump associate Boris Epshteyn, as Cohen tried to avoid admitting to lying, before admitting it.

Even some members of the jury stifled giggles, as the defence burst out its rapid-fire succession of profane quoted insults. Others chuckled aloud.

Asked about a topic that once drew him a criminal conviction for perjury, Cohen first said he had been ""inaccurate,"" then that he'd been ""untruthful,"" then finally admitted he'd lied and said the terms all meant the same thing.

Donalds repeatedly shook his head in amusement. Moments later, Trump's son, Eric, smiled broadly at members of the entourage, as he returned to the courtroom following a break.

It's unclear how much Cohen's testimony or his grilling will sway the jury: Some legal analysts have opined that this is primarily a documents case, where the human witnesses add context to bank records and invoices.","A man in a suit sits at a desk with a folder labeled ""Donald J. Trump"" and a document titled ""The big lie is a big lie.""",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BCAEFE830>,2024-05-14 19:05:00+00:00,https://www.cbc.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/michael-cohen-witness-cross-examination-1.7203950,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.9 ],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/cb7dab749f.png
e3e9993c1a,CNN,Tulsi Gabbard and a seasoned Trump impersonator: How Trump and Harris are preparing for their first head-to-head debate - CNN,"The first presidential debate of 2024 upended the race for the White House, effectively terminated the reelection aspirations of President Joe Biden and perhaps forever altered the direction of the country.

With so much potentially at risk at next month’s debate – which will be the first time former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris encounter each other at close range – the planning for the high-stakes showdown has already begun.

Harris held her first formal debate training session earlier this week at Howard University, the historically Black college in Washington, DC, she attended nearly four decades ago, and she is working closely with a seasoned Trump stand-in. Trump, meanwhile, has enlisted one of the vice president’s ex-rivals to help with the preparations: Tulsi Gabbard, the former representative from Hawaii who ran for president as a Democrat in 2020 in a crowded field that also included Harris.

After much back and forth, Trump and Harris agreed last week to the September 10 debate previously arranged by the campaigns of Trump and Biden. ABC, the host network, announced Friday it will be held at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia.

The political landscape in the United States and the fortunes of the country’s two major parties have drastically shifted in the weeks since the first presidential debate between Trump and Biden on June 27. The president’s lackluster performance that night shattered the confidence of his party and its donors, who in turn put immense pressure on Biden to drop out of the race. He eventually did on July 21 and endorsed Harris, giving the Democratic Party a new standard bearer and a sorely needed shot in the arm.

Swing state polls and national surveys show a race that has quickly tightened amid surging enthusiasm for Harris within her own party and new consideration from voters once put off by a Biden-Trump rematch.

Trump has struggled to cope with a reality he seems to believe he brought to fruition by beating Biden in their head-to-head showdown.

“I should have been a little bit easier,” Trump said at a news conferenceThursday. “Somebody said, ‘Your debate performance was horrible.’ I said, ‘Why?’ ‘Because you forced him out of government.’“

The race to prepare Harris, who has not stepped onto a debate stage since facing Trump’s former running mate Mike Pence in 2020, is underway and will intensify after the Democratic National Convention next week in Chicago.

A team of Democratic advisers joined Harris at Howard earlier this week, including Philippe Reines, a longtime aide to Hillary Clinton, who is reprising his role playing Trump at the request of the Harris campaign, several people familiar with the planning told CNN.

Karen Dunn, another longtime Clinton adviser who helped Harris prepare for her vice presidential debate in 2020, is also taking part in the preparation efforts, people familiar with the planning said. Former Harris aides Rohini Kosoglu and Sean Clegg are also involved with the effort, according to a person familiar with the prep.

The Washington Post was first to report the debate preparations involving Reines. The New York Times first reported on the involvement of Kosoglu and Clegg.

Trump, meanwhile, has revived the approach deployed ahead of his June debate with Biden, engaging in less formal policy sessions with close aides, advisers and allies in between campaign appearances and rounds of golf.

Gabbard’s involvement, first reported Friday by the New York Times, was confirmed to CNN by Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt. Gabbard, who left the Democratic Party in 2022, has found a home in Trump’s orbit and was even briefly considered as a potential running mate.

Trump’s interest in Gabbard as he prepares to face Harris next month stems in part from the notable exchanges the former congresswoman had with the vice president during their 2020 race. Harris in one debate criticized Gabbard for her foreign policy views while Gabbard in another challenged Harris’ record on criminal justice.

Seen mostly as a gadfly and an oddity during her Democratic primary run in 2019, Gabbard’s attack on Harris’ record as a prosecutor may have been her largest direct impact on the race. Given how much attention was on her attorney general record at the time, Harris had prepared for the attack, and by tracking comments Gabbard was making in interviews, aides to the then-California senator were able to predict not just that Gabbard would be the one to make the attack, but almost the wording of the question. They admitted afterward that they were shocked by just how much Gabbard was able to rattle Harris, and later said that it helped lock Harris into a tailspin her campaign never recovered from.

As he prepared to face Biden, Trump invited several of the Republicans he considered for his running mate to discuss issues and potential talking points. Gabbard now joins that mix.

The former president “does not need traditional debate prep but will continue to meet with respected policy advisors and effective communicators like Tulsi Gabbard, who successfully dominated Kamala Harris on the debate stage,” Leavitt said.

Trump has pushed for additional debates and had agreed to two others with Fox News and NBC. His running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, and Harris’ vice presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, agreed Thursday to an October 1 debate hosted by CBS News. Like Trump, Vance has called on Walz to agree to more, arguing for “as many debates as we possibly can.”

A senior campaign adviser said Harris is open to a second debate, but the details will not be settled until the first debate is in the books.

Publicly, though, the campaign has said otherwise. In a statement Thursday, Harris campaign spokesman Michael Tyler said, “The debate about debates is over.”

Value

Bluehost is one of the most expensive cPanel hosting providers we surveyed, with only one other name on this list matching its high price.

Confusing customer support information.

Why ScalaHosting is the best

ScalaHosting stands out for its careful attention to security. Even lower-tier plans get free secure sockets layer (SSL) certificates, which guarantee a website’s authenticity and encrypt communication between computers online. Some providers only offer SSL to higher-tier plans.

This provider also includes safety essentials, like protection against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which are malicious attempts to disrupt server traffic. If you want to ramp security up further, higher-tier plans have additional safeguards.

Value

ScalaHosting offers midrange plans with various tiers at different price points. We think the provider’s security features make it well worth the money. In addition to the security features described above, ScalaHosting also offers daily offsite backups for even its lower-tier plans. This really makes it stand out from the competition, as many providers only include automatic backups for higher-tier plans. Backups help prevent the loss of website data in case of a hack or similar incident and are essential to comprehensive security.

Functionality

Beyond its security features, ScalaHosting covers the essentials we’d expect from a reputable cPanel hosting provider, like unlimited bandwidth and a solid uptime guarantee. We like that a free business email is included, even for lower-tier plans. A dedicated email makes your business look more professional to consumers and is worth getting.

Value

Compared to the competition, InMotion is on the higher end of the pricing scale. However, we think it offers a good bang for your buck. Take something like a storage limit, for instance. Most of the other providers we surveyed cap lower-tier plan storage limits at 10, 30 or 50 GB. InMotion Hosting gives lower-tier plans a whopping 100 GB of storage. The 90-day money-back guarantee is also nice, as most providers cap it at 30 days.

InMotion Hosting stands out for including some extras that aren’t seen in every provider’s offering, like a free domain name and free business email. If you’re a small business owner, having all these features in a single package can streamline admin and cut costs.

Support

InMotion has an impressive online knowledge hub with more than 5,000 guides covering everything from webmail to SEO. Users can also access a community support forum and agents are available through live chat, email, support ticket and phone. We were unable to test out the live chat because it requested an account user’s email. However, we tried the phone number given and managed to reach an agent after a few automated prompts.

Pros

WordPress pre-installed.

Easy upgrades allow you to switch plans at any time.

Unmetered bandwidth for all plans.

Cons

Costs more than most competitors.

Phone support only for higher-tier plans.

Daily backups only for the most expensive plan and only free for the first year.

Why HostGator is the best

There is a good chance that you’ve opted to create your business website with WordPress, one of the most popular content management systems (CMS) for building websites. If so, HostGator is a great match as your cPanel hosting provider, thanks to the fact that it includes pre-installed WordPress plus one-click installs for quickly integrating apps.

Value

HostGator is among the most expensive cPanel hosting providers we surveyed. Given the big price tag, we were disappointed to discover that it only offers 10 GB of storage to its lowest-tier plans and that automatic backups are available only for the Business plan (which is even more expensive). However, it does give you a free domain for the first year, and a free email is included. Still, you can get the same features elsewhere for less.

Functionality

HostGator checks the essential boxes when it comes to what we look for in a cPanel hosting service, like a solid uptime guarantee and security features, from DDoS protection to a free SSL certificate. We also like how easy HostGator makes it to upgrade plans. If you’re an entrepreneur with the goal of scaling up your business, which can also mean growing your website, this is a nice plus.

Support

Like its competitors, HostGator offers 24/7 support. We tried the live chat option and were quickly connected to a live agent. HostGator also offers phone and email support, two types of support that aren’t always a given, as live chat seems to be the industry standard. If you’re looking for a DIY solution, there is also an online self-help portal.

Why TMDHosting is the best

If you’re not great with technology and need a cPanel hosting provider with excellent customer service, then TMDHosting is a solid pick. In addition to offering 24/7 support, it has some innovative contact options, like Slack. We were also impressed by the depth and breadth of this provider’s online knowledge base.

Value

TMDHosting is one of the more affordable names on our list. Despite the low cost, this provider still packs a powerful punch in terms of features, offering basics like a free SSL certificate and an impressive 50 GB of storage, even for its cheapest plans. To us, the biggest value lies in customer service, which stands out from the crowd.

Functionality

If you’re going to save on costs, be prepared to compromise on some features. TMDHosting’s lowest-cost cPanel hosting plan may be affordable, but it also limits you to one website and does not include backups. You’ll have to upgrade to a Business or Enterprise plan for backups.

Support

TMD offers 24/7 support and diverse contact options from Slack to chat. We tried the live chat function from the homepage and were able to connect with an agent right away. This provider also has an online knowledge base with great tutorials, including video guides. A look at real-world feedback for TMDHosting’s customer support revealed rave reviews.

Why A2 Hosting is the best

Do you already have a business website online but want to switch hosting providers? A2 Hosting will take care of migrating your website for you at no cost. That saves you a ton of time, stress and money. A2 Hosting’s pros promise they will get it done with minimal downtime and ensure intact data transfer.

Value

A2 Hosting is another affordable provider on our list, with only Mochahost offering a cheaper rate. Given the affordable price, there are some limitations. For example, a standard plan includes only one website. However, you still get some nice perks, like unlimited email accounts. If your current hosting provider doesn’t include email, for instance, it might be worth taking advantage of the free migration service to secure email.

Functionality

Not surprisingly, the lower cost of A2 Hosting means you’ll have to compromise on some functionality. Free SSL certificates are only available for pricier plans, for example. The same is true for automatic backups. Given how important these basic security essentials are, we’d recommend opting for a higher-tier plan or simply a different provider that includes these features in its basic plans.

Support

A2 Hosting promises 24/7 customer support. Support options include support tickets, phone and live chat for all tiers. We tested out the live chat and were quickly connected to an agent. There is a comprehensive online knowledge base covering both admin and tech topics. It also includes a “getting started” guide for first-time users.

Cons

Multiple complaints about poor migration services.

No DDos protection guarantee.

Why Mochahost is the best

If you’re looking to save money, Mochahost is worth a look. This was by far the cheapest provider on our list, costing half as much as some of the other names we surveyed. Even the lowest-cost plan includes unlimited bandwidth and automatic weekly backups. That said, it’s not perfect, and you may be better off spending the extra money for more features.

Value

It’s hard to argue with Mochahost’s low costs. If your top priority is cutting business expenses down, you’ll probably be tempted by the price tag. However, you’llget what you pay for – a low-tier plan will limit you to one website, for instance, and if you’re migrating your site from another host, you may encounter issues that can cost you more long-term. Mochahost also doesn’t guarantee protection against DDoS attacks, which is a big drawback in terms of security.

Functionality

Mochahost does include some basic essential features, like a solid uptime guarantee and a free SSL certificate. That said, you can’t expect any cushy perks from this affordable provider. Features like a free domain name or business email are not included with the lowest-tier plan. If you want a more comprehensive package, look elsewhere.

Support

Mochahost offers 24/7 support. You can reach the team by live chat, phone or ticket. We tried the chat and were able to access a live agent. There is also an online knowledge base, but we didn’t find it as well-organized as those of some competitors. The host provides a list of FAQs you have to sort through whereas some competitors have more in-depth tutorials, including videos.

Methodology

We extensively research the key competitors within an industry to determine the best products and services for your business. Our experts identify the factors that matter most to business owners, including pricing, features and customer support, to ensure that our recommendations offer well-rounded products that will meet the needs of various small businesses.

We collect extensive data to narrow our best list to reputable, easy-to-use products with stand-out features at a reasonable price point. And we look at user reviews to ensure that business owners like you are satisfied with our top picks’ services. We use the same rubric to assess companies within a particular space so you can confidently follow our blueprint to the best cPanel hosting in 2024.

Expert score (10%): Our expert score is based on four key points, each of them weighted equally: features, value for money, popularity and ease of use. In terms of features, we prioritize what matters to small business owners, like the inclusion of a free domain or business email.

When considering value, we want to determine if the expense of cPanel hosting is worth the cost to an entrepreneur. Ease of use is all about making sure a tool is practically usable without the tech expertise required. Finally, we consider popularity since more frequently used tools tend to have more real-world feedback.

Value (26%): We think price transparency is important for business owners on a budget, so our value assessment starts by checking whether pricing is publicly available to the consumer. We then judge costs, looking at monthly, annual, biennial and tri-annual plans as available.

We also consider whether prices go up after an introductory rate and, if so, by how much. This is important because we don’t want business owners to deal with the nasty surprise of a sudden increase in costs for cPanel hosting upon plan renewal. Finally, our value assessment looks at the availability of a free trial, which lets business owners test-drive a tool before investing in it.

Features (41%): As a business scales up, its website is likely to grow as well, for example, with more products to feature. That’s why we consider storage limits as part of our cPanel assessment for small business owners. We also look at factors that impact website loading speed, like bandwidth, plus characteristics that influence security, like DDoS protection, firewalls, SSL certificates and automatic backups.

Uptime guarantee is also a major consideration. If a business relies on a website and the platform goes down, that can meet lost customers and sales. Finally, we consider features that enhance convenience, like a free domain name and business email. Packaging these extras into a cPanel hosting bundle can also help entrepreneurs cut costs.

Service and support (8%): Businesses that rely on a website for promotional or sales purposes can’t afford to have tech glitches. If an issue does arise, it’s important to resolve it ASAP. This makes customer service a top concern.

Our research team looks for three types of support, live chat, phone and email. Diverse support options allow consumers to get help in the way that best suits them. We also consider the availability of a self-help knowledge base, where consumers can look up answers to questions themselves, removing the need to contact support and ultimately saving time.

Customer reviews (9%): There is no better barometer for the quality of a product than honest reviews from real-world users. That’s why our research team also checks out popular technology review platforms (Trustpilot, G2 and Capterra) to see what everyday users of these cPanel hosting providers have to say.

Hosting type (6%): Of course, to be included on our list, a company must offer cPanel hosting. It should also offer a form of managed hosting.

What is cPanel hosting, and how does it work?

cPanel hosting refers to Linux-based web hosting that includes a cPanel account to manage your web hosting. It can be used in different types of hosting, such as WordPress hosting, shared hosting and managed hosting.

cPanel allows you to take care of tasks like creating new email accounts, configuring domains and managing files. It’s popular among web developers and hosting companies thanks to its intuitive design and reliability.

How to choose the best cPanel hosting

Given the popularity of cPanel, many web hosting providers include it as a service. The good news is that you have a lot of options to choose from, but the choices can be overwhelming. Below, we explain what to look for when deciding what web host to use.

Key features to look for

There are a few essential characteristics that you shouldn’t compromise on when selecting a cPanel hosting provider. Here are some features that we consider must-haves:

Adequate storage: Website storage determines how much data you can save for your website, from text to images. Bigger sites with a lot of photos and videos will need more storage.

Sufficient bandwidth: Bandwidth determines how much traffic your site can handle. If you don’t have enough bandwidth to handle volume, you may find your website lagging and glitching.

Uptime guarantee: The last thing you want is frustrated web users ditching your website because it’s glitching or down. For a small business owner, that can mean lost sales! A standard uptime guarantee of 99% (the industry norm) helps ensure your web host is reliable.

Security features: Your business website doesn’t just have information about your company. You may also use it for processing customer data, including payment details. This makes security of the utmost importance. Look for features like firewalls, DDoS protection and free SSL certificates.

Add-ons and extras

There are some extra perks that are “nice to have” but not necessarily a must in a cPanel host. These add-ons that are especially beneficial to small business owners:

Free domain name: Having your domain name packaged with your internet hosting plan can cut down on administrative hassles and help save costs.

Business email: A dedicated business email that matches your domain name gives your business a more professional appearance.

Automatic backups: Backing up your website regularly is a smart security move, ensuring you still have access to your files in case of a crash. While you can manually back up a website, automatic backups take the task off your plate.

Customer service

Problems with your business website can lead to frustrated customers and a possible loss of business. Make sure your cPanel hosting provider offers dedicated customer service, ideally 24/7, across a variety of media (chat, email, phone and ticket).

We found that 24/7 support seems to be the minimum standard among the hosting providers we surveyed, so you shouldn’t have trouble finding a provider that meets this criteria.

How much does cPanel hosting cost?

The cPanel hosting plans we surveyed ranged from as low as $6.35 to $15.99 per month. Most providers have multiple tiers of plans. Higher-tier plans tend to have enhanced features, like greater storage space and the ability to host more websites.

If you are looking to save money on your cPanel hosting plan, consider signing up for a longer-term plan. According to our research, most providers make annual or tri-annual plans slightly cheaper than monthly plans.

Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

cPanel is not a web host itself but is a popular control panel used in web hosting. It offers a practical dashboard for managing web hosting that is easier to use than inputting complex commands.

Benefits of cPanel hosting include the user-friendly interface, compatibility with diverse browsers, reliable support and a wide range of features. cPanel allows users without advanced technical knowledge to perform complex tasks like creating subdomains for their websites and generating site backups, among other things.

Yes, there are web hosting providers with cPanel that you can access for free. However, be warned that free web hosting is usually not a smart idea. You will likely have to deal with annoying ads, slow loading speeds and limited storage space.

The biggest drawback is the potential for security vulnerabilities, which can leave your website at risk. This is especially problematic if you use your website to process sensitive customer data, including payment information.

Yes, it is possible to host multiple sites with a cPanel hosting service. That said, most cPanel hosts have multiple tiers of plans at different price points, and lower-tier plans may limit the number of websites you can host.

Note that the cPanel is not what allows for multiple websites; it simply serves as a control panel for managing them. The web host manager, which provides administrative control over the server, is what allows for multiple accounts to be created and more than one website to be managed. Web host managers and cPanel are often combined for maximum usability.

Yes, it’s possible to host a WordPress website using cPanel. WordPress is a popular CMS that you can use to build a website. It’s especially beloved for its themes and plug-ins, which make it easy to customize.

However, a WordPress site still needs to be hosted in order to appear online for people to find. That’s where a hosting provider comes into the picture. Some hosting providers even offer one-click WordPress site installation.

Our survey of cPanel hosting providers found prices ranging from $6.35 to $15.99 per month. Lower-cost plans usually have limited features and functionality. For example, the host may limit the number of websites you can host or have less storage space. You can save money on your web hosting by opting for longer-term plans, which are often slightly cheaper than monthly plans.

b9efcc29ff,Newsmax,Rep. Turner: Russian Space Nukes Threaten the World - Newsmax,"House Intelligence Chair Mike Turner, R-Ohio, who has been pushing the Biden administration to declassify information on Russia's nuclear anti-satellite program, is planning an address Thursday warning that the situation could become catastrophic if information about the looming threat is not addressed soon.

Turner, speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the Biden administration must ""immediately declassify all known information concerning the status of Russia's nuclear anti-satellite program"" and the United States must force compliance to the United Nations Outer Space Treaty, approved in 1966 governing nations' use and exploration of space.

Otherwise, Russia's use of nuclear aggression in space could lead to a dangerous ""Day Zero"" situation that could threaten communications systems worldwide, Turner warned.

""In order to avoid Day Zero, the Biden administration must immediately declassify all known information concerning the status of Russia's nuclear anti-satellite nuclear program,"" the congressman said. ""Vladimir Putin thrives in secrecy. Putin's plans and weapons programs must be fully disclosed by the administration and understood by the world.""

Further, the United States and its NATO allies must join together to declare their resolve to enforce the United Nations' outer space treaty, said Turner.

""I call on the Biden administration to do so,"" he said. ""There are risks in confronting Russia. The Biden administration is incredibly reluctant to take any action that would appear to be escalatory. However, Russia is the esclaratory aggressor. Escalation has already occurred.""

But if Russia is permitted to proceed, ""This threat would mean that our economic, international security and social systems come to a grinding halt,"" Turner said. ""This would be a catastrophic and devastating attack upon Western economic, and democratic systems. Vladimir Putin knows this — checkmate.""

Turner said Thursday that, ""Day Zero can be avoided…just as [Nikita] Kruschev could have held the United States hostage with nuclear threats from Cuba, Vladimir Putin will hold the world's space assets hostage to counter attempts to stop him from reassembling the Soviet Union.""

According to the congressman, if Russia detonates a nuclear weapon within low Earth orbit, that would destroy satellites used for much of modern society, including stopping global communications for at least a year, including for cellphones, GPS, and more.

Turner, meanwhile, says that the lack of information coming from the Biden administration about the danger is worrisome.

CSIS said its event will feature a discussion on the role of nuclear weapons in U.S. foreign policy and strategy, including the strategic landscape, nuclear modernization, deterrence efforts, and arms control, including how the intelligence community is postured to address such challenges.

Turner issued similar warnings earlier this year, saying that he warned his colleagues of a ""serious national security threat"" with Russian anti-satellite capabilities and saying he was concerned that the Biden administration was ""sleepwalking into an international crisis.""

The intelligence committee in February informed all members of Congress about an unspecified ""serious national security threat,"" with White House national security communications adviser John Kirby confirming the threat was related to a Russian anti-satellite capability.",A man in a suit and tie is speaking into a microphone at a podium with a sign that reads 'CON'.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x187 at 0x7D6BA38EC760>,2024-06-20 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.newsmax.com,https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/mike-turner-russia-nuclear/2024/06/20/id/1169470/,['Politics' 'International'],[0.9 0.8],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/b9efcc29ff.png
bc462c2edd,The Globe and Mail,Undervalued and ignored: Why young Canadian firms are looking to foreign investors and buyers - The Globe and Mail,"From the start, ZS2 Technologies Ltd. was built to go public. The Calgary-based business was founded by stock market veterans who put in place the building blocks of a publicly traded company: governance, oversight and financial reporting. When the time was right, an initial public offering would provide the exposure and capital to take it to the next level.

But the plan has changed. ZS2 is no longer destined for the Toronto Stock Exchange.

ZS2 specializes in high-tech, sustainable building materials. Demand comes mostly from the U.S. construction industry. There is talk of manufacturing stateside, where ZS2 recently incorporated. There are tax advantages to consider. And calls are coming in from U.S. investors hunting for promising growth stories.

“They have an appetite for risk and they see the potential of what we’re doing,” said Scott Jenkins, ZS2′s co-founder and chief executive officer. By contrast, “access to capital in Canada has been challenging, which is shocking.”

It is hard to make sense of that disparity. ZS2 is fast-growing, technology-driven and sells a cleaner product to a huge industry. It checks many boxes that investors are looking for. Its flagship product is a low-carbon cement – the traditional limestone variety is one of the world’s most emissions-intensive products. ZS2 even uses waste water from Alberta mining and energy industries in its manufacturing process.

Yet ZS2 appears fated to join the ranks of young businesses that find better growth opportunities outside Canadian capital markets. “I want to build an amazing Canadian technology company in the world’s largest industry,” Mr. Jenkins said. “I’m bullish on Canadian talent and ideas. The problem is with the ecosystem meant to support these companies.”

The framework for nurturing junior companies through Canadian stock markets has been largely gutted. Gone are many of the boutique brokerages and small-cap investment funds that once provided lifeblood to the sector. Investor interest has petered out. Seventeen years after the S&P/TSX Venture Composite Index hit a record high, the index is down 83 per cent. Valuations have collapsed. Trading volumes are near 20-year lows.

Things are no better for small stocks on the senior exchange. The number of TSX-listed operating companies has shrunk by 40 per cent since 2008, according to TMX Group Ltd., parent of the TSX and TSX Venture Exchange. There hasn’t been an IPO on the TSX in 18 months. In fact, companies have been streaming in the opposite direction.

A burst of 20 tech IPOs on the TSX during the COVID-19 pandemic looked like the start of a new paradigm for a sector that had produced, on average, just one IPO on the exchange a year since the 2000s. But that 18-month explosion ended in late 2021 and now looks like an anomaly driven by the same gold-rush mindset of the original dot-com boom.

Almost half of those 20 issuers have now gone private, delisted or been taken over. Copperleaf Technologies Inc. was the latest. In June, the Vancouver capital budget planning and analytics software company agreed to be acquired by a Swedish multinational for $1-billion. “Canadian public investors lose out on a compelling small-cap software growth story,” Royal Bank of Canada analyst Paul Treiber said in a note.

There was a time when Canada’s public markets did a marvellous job of turning startups into billion-dollar companies. The country’s early-stage financing markets were the envy of the world, centred around capitalizing on its vast natural resources. The best names graduated to the TSX, creating a pipeline of new listings.

Among the hundreds of companies that followed this route was Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.CNQ-T, now Canada’s fifth-largest public company, with a market capitalization exceeding $100-billion. Other tech companies made their public debuts on the TSX proper, including Research in Motion Ltd. and Constellation Software Inc.

Other countries, including the United States, have also seen steady declines in the number of public listings. But the trend arguably matters more to Canada’s stock market, which has been uniquely rooted in its prolific small-cap roster. These days, the junior contingent of Canada’s public markets is largely undervalued and ignored.

So, capital-constrained companies from Canada such as ZS2 look instead to foreign investors and acquirers.

“It’s just not a long-term solution for the country,” said Bryce Tingle, a University of Calgary corporate finance expert who for years has warned of the dangers of a diminishing small-cap market.

How did we get to this point? Much had to go wrong.

The long fall

In the commodity boom years of the 1990s and early 2000s, the real action went through boutique brokerages. There were dozens, flush with money from retail investors eager to get in on the frenzy.

Deals happened quickly, typically through a vehicle now called a capital pool company (CPC). Entrepreneurs would list a shell company, raise cash and use it to buy a private business.

“It was quick, efficient and cheap,” said Darrin Hopkins, a senior wealth adviser at iA Private Wealth in Calgary who estimates he took 130 companies public this way over the past 30 years. “The prospectus was maybe 12 pages long. You did a qualifying transaction in a month, drilled a couple of oil wells and you’re off to the races.”

It wasn’t just resources. Boardwalk Real Estate Investment Trust BEI-UN-T, the sixth-largest REIT on the TSX, started as a CPC. So did Well Health Technologies Corp., Canada’s largest owner of outpatient health clinics.

When the commodity supercycle fizzled in the early 2010s, it took with it the underlying force that sustained the Canadian small-cap mosaic. Dozens of small brokerages that had financed junior energy and mining plays failed or were bought by big banks.

As the banks consolidated their grip over the Canadian wealth management business, the appetite for small caps withered. The crash soured a generation of investors who were overexposed to resource plays. Regulatory changes made it difficult for advisers, especially those working for banks, to recommend junior names to clients. “They’re making so much money on structured products and mutual funds,” Mr. Hopkins said. “The banks don’t need that hassle.”

At the same time, domestic pension funds drastically cut their exposure to Canadian stocks, from 28 per cent of assets in 2000 to about 4 per cent today, after federal budget changes in 2005 that scrapped foreign investment limits.

Beyond traditional industries such as banking, utilities and railroads, Canada is a country of small- and medium-sized enterprises. Outside the S&P/TSX 60 Index, pretty much every listed company is small cap by global standards. But our pension funds now stalk bigger game, preferring to write nine-figure cheques to foreign companies such as Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., as Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan did in 2019, that would overwhelm the capital needs of many young companies here.

“We have a disconnect,” said Alison Nankivell, CEO of Toronto’s MaRS Discovery District, which supports startups. “Our capital is tied up in groups that are too large to deal with the reality of our economy.”

The pension retreat has resulted in an extraction of capital from Canadian stocks to the tune of $1-trillion. “That’s one-quarter of the Canadian market – gone,” said Dan Daviau, CEO of Canaccord Genuity Group Inc., the country’s largest independent investment dealer. “We’ve lost so much money out of our public markets that it just becomes a supply-demand imbalance.”

Valuations reflect that imbalance. The average stock on the S&P/TSX Composite Index trades at about 14 times forward earnings. The S&P 500 Index, meanwhile, trades at 21 times. The gap between the two indexes is about as large as it has ever been and reflects the fact that highly valued technology companies account for a third of the U.S. index, about four times that sector’s share of its Canadian counterpart.

There is also a lack of domestic growth capital for companies that evolve past the startup stage, says Ms. Nankivell, who previously led fund investments and global scaling for Business Development Bank of Canada’s venture capital unit.

The estrangement of the small-cap sector from mainstream investing can’t be pinned on the commodity crash alone. Retail investors returned to the space with enthusiasm with the legalization of recreational cannabis in 2018 and when tech valuations vaulted in 2020-21. The buzz was short lived, however, as many new issues cratered in value.

“We hollowed out oil and gas, we hollowed out mining, and then investors got burned on cannabis and speculative technology,” said Neil Selfe, CEO of Toronto mergers and acquisitions advisory firm Infor Financial Group.

With that, the small-cap alienation was complete. Just seven CPCs have started trading on the TSX Venture so far this year. Last year there were 30. In 2007, there were 180.

The investing world came to demand size and profitability above all. U.S. Big Tech owns the moment. Nobody is paying attention to our small caps. That is, except foreign acquirers.

“A lot of the good companies are just saying, ‘Enough is enough, let’s go private,’ ” says Rob Laidlaw, CEO of Toronto digital media company VerticalScope Holdings Inc., which went public on the TSX in 2021.

The ones that got away

It’s hard to witness the ascendance of Silicon Valley giant Nvidia Corp. without wondering what might have been. There was a time when ATI Technologies Inc. ran neck and neck with Nvidia in the graphics chip market. The difference was that ATI was Canadian. It lacked investor support and became a takeover target.

ATI was swallowed by U.S.-based Advanced Micro Devices Inc. in 2006 and forgotten. Nvidia, meanwhile, became one of the world’s most valuable companies, worth US$3-trillion, equal to the combined value of all TSX-listed companies.

The most recent crop of Canadian tech stocks, meanwhile, are also finding themselves in the sights of foreign acquisitors. During the pandemic, they cashed in on furious demand by public investors for young, fast-growing tech companies. That didn’t last. Every one of the 20 that went public on the TSX from mid-2020 to late 2021 eventually traded below their issue prices. Some collapsed to pennies a share in the selloff that began in the fall of 2021.

Many were too underdeveloped to matter to public markets investors unwilling to fund continued losses of young firms with illiquid floats. “A whole bunch of companies went public that shouldn’t have,” said Ian Giffen, lead director of education software vendor D2L Inc., which went public in 2021. “They weren’t ready.” (Then again, risk-taking venture capitalists also got nervous, prompting widespread cost cuts by private and public tech companies in 2022 and 2023.)

Most spent their brief time as listed companies underappreciated by Canadian investors. U.S. private investors, on the other hand, saw value. Magnet Forensics Inc., Nuvei Corp. and Q4 Inc. have all been bought or taken off the market by U.S. private equity firms. Other, more seasoned Canadian-listed software companies, including Absolute Software Corp., mdf commerce Inc. and TrueContext Corp., have also recently agreed to buyouts.

The trend is likely to continue. Private equity and venture capital firms are sitting on a record US$2.6-trillion in dry powder, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence and market research firm Preqin. “They are crawling all over each other, looking for Canadian deal flow,” said Mark Borkowski, president of Mercantile Mergers & Acquisitions Corp. “They call every day.”

A U.S. private equity buyout doesn’t mean those companies are lost. Most of the recent deals don’t involve physical relocation, though many redomicile in Delaware. Some could go public again when the funds exit their investments.

But that doesn’t mean there isn’t a cost. “Every time one of these Canadian success stories gets bought by U.S. private equity, the big high-paying jobs start to move to the U.S.,” says VerticalScope’s Mr. Laidlaw. “There’s an incredible brain drain going on, whether it’s crypto, AI, software.”

That drain is a bigger concern when a company is scooped up by a strategic acquirer, as was the case for Copperleaf. That offer, from past suitor IFS AB, landed when Copperleaf stock was trading more than 30 per cent below its 2021 IPO price. “Public markets didn’t see the value that we saw,” IFS CEO Mark Moffat said. “It created an opportunity for us.”

Copperleaf had hoped to raise awareness with the IPO, “but the Canadian market doesn’t give you the same exposure” as a U.S. listing would, former CEO Judi Hess said.

Instead, Copperleaf was punished by a market that suddenly turned against money-losing, illiquid early-stage companies, a cruel twist given that Copperleaf had been profitable for years until increasing spending pre-IPO to accelerate growth. “To do the right thing from a business perspective, they had to be investing. That simply wasn’t rewarded in the short term,” says Maria Pacella, managing partner with Pender Ventures, an arm of Vancouver’s PenderFund Capital Management Ltd., Copperleaf’s largest outside investor.

There are lots of other small Canadian tech companies trading at discounts. RBC’s Mr. Treiber noted two other potential takeout candidates: Coveo Solutions Inc., which trades at less than half its IPO price, and D2L Inc., off by more than 20 per cent.

It defeats the purpose of being listed publicly if a company cannot maintain a reasonable valuation. It makes you a takeover target. It raises your cost of capital. It weakens your ability to use your stock as currency to acquire companies, which for some was a key reason to go public. And it makes it hard to justify the huge time and expense, not to mention meeting the ever-expanding list of governance best practices and regulatory requirements involved with running a listed company.

“It’s frustrating,” said Mr. Laidlaw, who has seen Verticalscope shares drop 60 per cent since the IPO. “We’re paying $1-million to $2-million a year to be public. You do that to access capital and investors, and it’s really not there.”

Extraordinary regulatory requirements mean everything takes longer and costs more. It takes an average of 18 years to bring a Canadian mine from first drill to production. And the CPC program is no longer a fast, efficient and cheap back door to public markets, says Mr. Hopkins, who has facilitated just one CPC listing in the past year-and-a-half.

The latest irritant in entrepreneurial circles was the federal government’s increase to the taxable portion of capital gains this year. The fear is that the tax hike may discourage investing in Canadian public companies at a time when capital is scarce for most small companies.

“Every time you make an adjustment like that, you start to change that dynamic of where companies want to grow up,” said Tom Liston, a tech investor who sits on the board of Well Health. “The costs have gone up and most of the advantages of being a public company have disappeared.”

The fallout

Canada’s innovation and productivity gap is one of our biggest public policy issues. The Canadian economy is smaller than it was in 2019, after adjusting for inflation and immigration, according to RBC Economics.

There are many reasons Canada has fallen behind most other major economies. One culprit is the failure to produce giant, world-class publicly traded technology companies. No other Canadian company has come close to Shopify Inc., which went public in 2015 and last week sported a $125-billion market capitalization. That is about 50 times the value of Lightspeed Commerce Inc., the next most valuable Canadian tech company to go public since.

“Canadians come up with the ideas, they start companies, but few large-scale innovative firms exist in the country,” the University of Calgary’s Mr. Tingle wrote in a recent research paper.

Many of the most promising companies leave before they have a chance to attain scale. One study found that of 164 acquisitions of Canadian technology firms between 2004 and 2012, just one featured a Canadian buyer (domestic-buying-domestic activity has picked up moderately since then). Each year there is attrition from the public markets and not enough junior companies in the pipeline replacing them. Canada’s public exchanges lose around 60 operating companies on average each year.

Once a company is taken private, chances are it won’t return to the public markets. When it comes time for that investor to exit, it is almost always through a sale to a strategic acquirer or another private equity firm. Over the past five calendar years, IPOs accounted for just 5 per cent of U.S. private equity exits, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. An IPO is never a clean exit for private equity, which usually requires another year or two after issue to sell their stakes in an orderly fashion, leaving their gains at the mercy of market swings.

Companies that remain public, meanwhile, are limited in growth options if they lack access to reasonably priced capital. “Companies won’t take the risk, won’t start that new factory, or develop that new product, unless they’re comfortable that they will have enough money,” Mr. Daviau says.

Canada has a poor track record in business investment. In the 15 years up to 2021, capital investment for each worker declined by 20 per cent, Statistics Canada reported this year. A study last July from Boston Consulting Group’s Centre for Canada’s Future ranked Canada second to last in research and development spending among 15 developed economies, and one-third of U.S. levels per capita.

The trends are reversible, insists John McKenzie, CEO of TMX Group. There is a pipeline of 2,000 private Canadian companies that could scale up on Canadian exchanges and the entire small-cap ecosystem will revitalize if there’s money to be made, he said he believes. “Once you’ve got a very robust market again, you will start to get new startup dealers, and you will get expansion again.”

But it will only happen with regulatory and policy changes, he adds. And with the world’s biggest, most liquid market next door, just levelling the playing field won’t cut it. “We need to be more competitive on tax policy, more competitive in terms of how fast we can permit new mining companies and things like that. We can’t just be designing our market to tie.”","An image of a busy city street with people walking, a digital stock market display showing the TSX index, and a traffic light with a 'no vehicles except' sign.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x151 at 0x7D6B7EC02DA0>,2024-09-02 20:33:40.338000+00:00,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-why-canada-cant-grow-its-corporate-minnows-into-sharks-any-more/,['Business and Finance'],[0.95],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/bc462c2edd.png
00ef772c5e,The Globe and Mail,"Ontario LCBO strike sows supply-chain havoc for alcohol importers, restaurants - The Globe and Mail","The strike by more than 9,000 employees of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario is creating confusion in the supply chain for alcoholic beverages in the province, as import agents seek clarity on the state of shipments, and restaurants and bars struggle to keep products in stock.

On Monday, the LCBO sent a memo to shipping companies that transport products, instructing them to hold cargo already received at warehouses, and to pause activities such as bookings of shipping vessels until further notice.

LCBO workers represented by the Ontario Public Service Employees Union (OPSEU) walked off the job last Friday, forcing 669 stores to close. The union opposes the Ontario government’s plan to greatly expand sales of ready-to-drink, spirit-based beverages in convenience stores later this summer. Union leaders have said that wider privatization of alcohol sales would threaten the LCBO’s viability as a retailer. They are also advocating for improved job security and working conditions and greater access to benefits, among other issues.

The LCBO has continued to sell alcohol through its website and mobile app during the strike, and alcohol remains on sale at private retailers such as The Beer Store, grocery stores, and on-site at wineries and breweries.

Ontario directs LCBO to increase promotion of local products amid strike

The notification about shipping pauses, however, raised questions among import agents, who strike deals on behalf of manufacturers, such as wineries, to promote and sell their products, about possible disruptions to their businesses.

The LCBO is still the importer of record for those products coming from outside of Ontario, and transactions go through the LCBO, with agents earning a commission – whether on sales to restaurants and bars, or directly to consumers willing to purchase a case. Some agents also facilitate deliveries within the province.

“If all our shipments are being frozen now, we’re not going to have wine in two to three months,” said Harris Davidson, managing director of Toronto-based Rogers & Company, which has been in the fine wine business for roughly 40 years.

Part of his revenues come from commissions on sales of products to LCBO stores, which dried up as a result of the strike, he explained. “I had a potential partial lift from being able to serve customers who weren’t going to shop in the LCBO during the strike. But now that consignment side of my business is in serious jeopardy.”

However, the scale of the shipping disruption remains unclear. The memo, posted online by industry association Drinks Ontario, noted that the LCBO’s transportation division would conduct “a daily call to review open items and shipment status updates.”

Drinks Ontario – which represents agents, suppliers and other industry members – is seeking additional information from the LCBO about which products are affected by the freight pause, according to a bulletin sent to its members.

“Given the impacts of OPSEU’s strike on LCBO operations, we had to pause carrier partner pickups to help reduce congestion in our warehouses and across our supply chain,” the LCBO wrote in an emailed statement to The Globe on Tuesday “Consignment orders are being reviewed individually to optimize product flow.”

The OPSEU did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.

“This has the potential to be cause of alarm, but I’m not sounding the alarm yet,” said Colin Halpern of Toronto-based Halpern Enterprises, which represents more than 175 wineries and distilleries around the world. He has reached out to the LCBO to ask how the freight pause will impact his orders going forward, and is waiting for clarification, he added.

LCBO strike spells opportunity – and uncertainty – for businesses

Meanwhile, restaurants and bars are also growing concerned about their ability to order the products they need to run their businesses, said Kris Barnier, vice-president of Central Canada for industry group Restaurants Canada. Business owners who have tried to order through the LCBO’s website have noticed many products out of stock.

“The inventory is not in the system,” Mr. Barnier said. “It’s creating increasing challenges for restaurants.”

He added that many establishments are already struggling with debt left over from temporary closings during the pandemic, and expenses such as food costs, rent and wages that have risen significantly over the past two years.

“This creates some real risk for a lot of businesses,” Mr. Bernier said.","A man holds a sign that reads 'LCBO workers on strike' in front of a line of trucks, with other people in the background.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BA22E35E0>,2024-07-09 23:25:01.332000+00:00,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-ontario-liquor-strike-sows-supply-chain-havoc-for-alcohol-importers/,['Local/Regional' 'Business and Finance'],[0.9  0.85],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/00ef772c5e.png
9ad2b0d36c,CBS News,"How long will it take to pay off $50,000 in credit card debt? - CBS News","Today's high-rate landscape has made it tough to find affordable loans — and that's true whether you're trying to obtain a personal loan, a mortgage loan or any other type. But while borrowing costs are substantially higher across the board than they were just a few years ago, it's credit cards, in particular, that have become incredibly costly.

At nearly 23%, the average credit card interest rate is almost twice as high as the average personal loan rate. And unlike personal loans, credit card interest compounds, meaning that the interest is charged on not just the principal but the interest the balance accrues over time. In turn, any balance you carry from month to month can balloon quickly, making it feel impossible to get ahead on what you owe.

It can be even tougher to tackle what you owe if you're carrying a hefty balance, like $50,000 in credit card debt. Most people can't afford to pay off that type of balance quickly, and the longer it sits, the harder it will be to pay off. That's why it's important to be proactive about paying off your credit cards now. But how long would it take to pay off a $50,000 credit card balance? Here, we'll break down what to know.

Need help with your high-rate credit card debt? Find out what your best debt relief options are now.

How long will it take to pay off $50,000 in credit card debt?

Here's what it would take to pay off a $50,000 credit card balance using different payment approaches at the current average rate of 22.76%:

The minimum payment approach

The minimum payment is typically around 1% of the balance plus interest. If you pay that amount each month, here's what you can expect:

Time to pay off: Approximately 42 years and 8 months

Total interest paid: $95,178.93

Total amount paid: $145,178.93

Paying 2.5% of the balance

If you pay 2.5% of the outstanding balance each month instead, here's what you can expect:

Time to pay off: Approximately 69 years and 5 months

Total interest paid: $162,864.60

Total amount paid: $212,864.60

Paying 5% of the balance

If you increase your payment to 5% of the outstanding balance each month, here's what you can expect:

Time to pay off: Approximately 15 years and 9 months

Total interest paid: $30,976.51

Total amount paid: $80,976.51

A fixed $1,500 monthly payment

If you commit to a monthly fixed payment amount of $1,500, here's what you can expect:

Time to pay off: Approximately 4 years and 4 months

Total interest paid: $27,980.51

Total amount paid: $77,980.51

A fixed $2,000 monthly payment

With a more aggressive fixed-payment approach of $2,000 per month, here's what you can expect:

Time to pay off: Approximately 2 years and 10 months

Total interest paid: $17,498.79

Total amount paid: $67,498.79

Explore your debt relief options and tackle your expensive credit card debt today.

What credit card debt relief options are worth considering?

If you're facing such a substantial amount of credit card debt, it makes sense to explore all strategies available to you. Here are some debt relief strategies that may be worth considering:

Debt consolidation: With this strategy, you take out a debt consolidation loan, typically with a lower interest rate, to pay off all your credit cards and consolidate multiple payments into a single monthly payment.

Balance transfer: With a balance transfer, you move your current card balances to a new card with 0% intro APR. The interest-free period allows you to make more headway toward principal.

Debt management: By enrolling in a debt management plan through a credit counseling agency, you may be able to lower the rates and fees on your credit cards and combine your payments into a single monthly payment.

Debt settlement: With debt settlement (or debt forgiveness), the goal is to negotiate with your creditors to accept less than what's owed. This could significantly reduce the amount you owe, making it easier and cheaper to pay off a hefty balance.

Bankruptcy: Filing for either Chapter 7 (liquidation) or Chapter 13 (repayment plan) bankruptcy could help you restructure or get rid of what you owe on your credit cards. However, the credit implications are severe, so this is typically a last-resort option.

Each option outlined above has its pros and cons. The best choice typically depends on your specific financial situation, credit score and long-term goals. It may be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor or credit counselor to determine the most suitable approach for your circumstances.

5b85bc328b,Global News,Okanagan farmers plead for government help in preserving BC Tree Fruits Co-op assets - Global News,"More than 100 farmers, many of them members of the BC Tree Fruits Cooperative, gathered at a busy Kelowna, B.C., intersection Tuesday morning as they fight to save the co-op.

“I would like some sort of government to step in to protect the farmers of the Interior. Like it needs to be done,” said Kelly Wander, the rally’s organizer.

With a debt of $58 million, the co-op’s board filed for creditor protection two weeks ago, leaving some 300 Okanagan farmers in a grim situation in the middle of harvest.

They say smaller, private packing houses simply don’t have the capacity to meet the needs of farmers and their fruit.

“A lot of these people don’t have that storage. They can only store 12,000 bins and a lot of these farmers have over 50,000 to 100,000 bins. Where are they supposed to go,” asked Wander.

The urgent situation comes on the heels of several bad weather related crop years.

B.C.’s Supreme Court ordered the co-op to sell all of its assets last week including the new, multi-million-dollar, state-of–the art packing house in Oliver.

“The Province took no stand at that last court hearing where the judge granted those assets be sold,” Wander said. “Why is the government not stepping in.”

The affected farmers are desperately calling on the government to work with them in preserving those assets.

“We are asking the government to bring us back into operational by paying our loan on a term and condition plan,” Wander told Global News.

“We did have lots of crop loss, but there is lots of fruit coming off, like there are bumper crops that will be coming back. So it’s not like there is no money to pay the government back. We will have money to give the government back.”

B.C.’s agriculture ministry did not respond in time for publication.

According to Wander, a bid will be accepted by Nov. 15 with the successful bidder acquiring the asset or assets on Nov. 30.

Affected farmers are warning government inaction could come with dire consequences.

“There will be no farming industry, there will be no fruit. We don’t know,” said farmer Param Brar. “What are we going to do in the future?”

Wander said the farmers are not giving up and will only up the ante as they plan their next move, which could include a convoy of tractors making its way to Victoria in an effort to make more noise.","A group of people holding signs with messages about farmers and government assistance, standing on a roadside.",<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x125 at 0x7D6BA1640970>,2024-09-04 01:00:46+00:00,https://globalnews.ca,https://globalnews.ca/news/10731241/okanagan-farmers-government-help-bc-tree-fruits-co-op-assets/,['Local/Regional' 'Politics'],[0.9 0.8],Unlikely,Likely,sample_review/images/5b85bc328b.png
02e99326b3,New York Post,3 Roborock vacuums from budget to high-end — Read our honest review - New York Post,"If you’re anything like me, the thought of keeping your floors spotless without lifting a finger is about as exciting now as waking up on Christmas morning was as a kid. And with two dogs, as perfect as they are, my house can get a bit … hairy.

With WFH days dwindling and days in the office requiring longer commutes, I have exactly zero interest in spending any time vacuuming and mopping with the few hours I have at home these days.

RELATED: The best vacuum cleaners for cleaning your home: Tested and reviewed

So, I was ready to outsource my dirty work in order to spend more time doing what I love – enjoying a clean house and not actually cleaning it.

Roborock Review – Best Robot Vacuums

After combing through a seemingly endless number of robot brands ready to remedy my rooms of residual dust, debris, and dog hair, I opted to test three of Roborock’s top models and see which one is best for keeping up with the daily mess life throws my way.

Whether you’re a first-time buyer or a seasoned robot vacuum pro, there’s something here for everyone.

Roborock QRevo: Best Robot Vacuum for Pet Hair

First up, the Roborock QRevo. This robot vacuum is a game-changer, especially if you’re dealing with any amount of pet hair. With two pups, Gloria and Mingo (and R.I.P. to our third, Margot), I needed something that could keep up, and the QRevo delivered.

This vacuum is a mid-level model, but don’t let that fool you – it’s packed with features that make it a serious contender for the best robot vacuum for pet hair.

The QRevo is a vacuum and mop combo, which is already a big win in my book. It has a powerful 7,000 Pa suction system that easily pulls in dirt, dust, and pet hair. But what really sets it apart is the dual spinning mops that lift up when the vacuum detects carpet. This means you can have your hard floors mopped and your carpets vacuumed in one go without worrying about getting your rugs wet. The mopping system itself is pretty impressive, with pads that spin at 200 revolutions per minute, making short work of even the most stubborn dried-on messes.

But the star of the show is the multifunctional dock. It empties the vacuum’s dustbin, washes and dries the mop pads, and refills the water tank. I’ve never seen a robot vacuum dock do so much all by itself. It’s like having a little cleaning crew on standby, ready to spring into action whenever needed. For someone like me, who doesn’t have time to fuss with cleaning supplies every other day, this level of automation is a dream.

Downsides? Well, the obstacle avoidance isn’t quite as advanced as what you’ll find on the higher-end models like the S8 Max Ultra, but the price isn’t as high either.

It can occasionally bump into things or struggle with very cluttered spaces, but for the price, it’s a small trade-off.

One thing I do appreciate about the QRevo is the option to choose between white and black finishes. It might seem like a minor detail, but it’s nice to have a choice that fits your home’s decor. In my case, the white version blends in perfectly with my home, which is a nice change from the usual techy black.

Roborock S8 Max Ultra: Best Robot Vacuum and Mop

If you’re looking for the ultimate cleaning machine, this is it. The Roborock S8 Max Ultra is the crème de la crème of robot vacuums. This beast has it all: 10,000 Pa of suction power, advanced mopping power, and a RockDock Ultra that takes care of everything from emptying to hot drying.

The S8 Max Ultra is not just a vacuum; it’s a full-fledged cleaning system designed to make your life easier.

Let’s start with the suction power. With up to 10,000 Pa, the S8 Max Ultra is one of the most powerful robot vacuums on the market. It doesn’t just clean – it deep cleans. Whether it’s spills in the kitchen, crumbs under the couch, or dust bunnies under the bed, this vacuum picks up everything in its path.

If you’ve got hard floors, the advanced VibraRise 2.0 mopping system will leave them gleaming. This system uses sonic vibrations to scrub floors at 4,000 vibrations per minute, which means even the most stubborn dirt doesn’t stand a chance.

But what really sets the S8 Max Ultra apart is the RockDock Ultra. This is not your average docking station. It’s an 8-in-1 self-maintenance dock that handles everything from emptying the dustbin to washing and drying the mop pads. It even has an auto-detergent dispenser and can refill the water tank.

And let’s not forget the self-cleaning feature that keeps the dock itself spotless. It’s like having a personal cleaning assistant on call 24/7.

One of my favorite features of the S8 Max Ultra is the built-in video camera. As a dog dad who’s outright obsessed with my pups, I love being able to check in on them while the vacuum does its thing. The camera allows me to see what’s happening at home, which is especially reassuring when I’m out and about.

Of course, all this luxury comes at a price. At $1,399, the S8 Max Ultra is definitely an investment. But if you value convenience and want the best of the best, it’s worth every penny.

Roborock Q5 Max+: Best Budget Robot Vacuum

If that sticker shock, well, sucks, Roborock has something for you too. The Q5 Max+ is a fantastic option if you’re looking for a reliable robot vacuum without shelling out for all the bells and whistles.

Priced under $600, this vacuum offers a lot of value for the money. You get 5,500 Pa of suction power, which might not sound like much compared to some higher-end models, but let me tell you, it packs a punch.

The Q5 Max+ comes with a long-lasting battery that gives you up to four hours of runtime. That’s enough to cover a large home or run multiple cleaning sessions before needing to recharge.

Plus, the self-emptying dock is a game-changer. It can hold up to seven weeks’ worth of dirt and debris, so you don’t have to worry about emptying it out after a single run or even every few days. Dog owners know, this feature alone is worth the investment.

One thing to certainly call out about the Q5 Max+ is that while it’s great on carpets and hard floors, don’t expect it to do any mopping. This vacuum is just that, a vacuum and nothing more, which is fine if that’s all you need, but it’s something to keep in mind if you’re looking for an all-in-one solution.

dcd9094062,The Washington Post,Americans apparently arrested in Congo amid accusations of coup attempt - The Washington Post,"Congolese army spokesperson Brig. Gen. Sylvain Ekenge told state television in a brief statement that the coup attempt had been swiftly stopped by Congolese security forces.

The U.S. ambassador tweeted that she had received reports that U.S. citizens were involved, and local media published footage of two men under arrest, their hands clasped pleadingly, with pictures of a passport that indicated one was a 36-year-old U.S. citizen born in Maryland. Media reports indicated that three other Americans were also arrested. The reports could not be independently confirmed.

“I am shocked by the events of this morning and very concerned by reports of American citizens allegedly involved,” Ambassador Lucy Tamlyn tweeted in French. “… We will cooperate with DRC authorities to the fullest extent as they investigate these criminal acts and hold accountable any U.S. citizen involved.”

Congo is home to nearly 100 million people, and endemic corruption and repeated civil wars mean most people live in desperate poverty despite the central African nation’s mineral riches, which include gold, copper, nickel and cobalt — vital for the world’s green energy transition.

Parliamentary leadership elections were supposed to be held over the weekend, but they were postponed by President Félix Tshisekedi. He won a second term in a chaotic December vote that was widely criticized for poor planning and a lack of transparency.

The three deaths reportedly occurred at the residence of Vital Kamerhe — a member of parliament previously jailed for corruption but now running to become speaker — which was allegedly attacked before the presidential palace.

“Two of the police officers assigned to his guard, as well as one of the attackers, lost their lives,” Kamerhe’s spokesman Michel Moto Muhima posted on X.

The coup attempt appears to have been led by Christian Malanga, a 41-year-old man who set up a political organization among the Congolese diaspora in the United States and proclaimed himself president of Congo in exile. Congolese intelligence suspected him of previously trying to assassinate President Joseph Kabila, said Dino Mahtani, who has held senior positions for the United Nations in Congo; Kabila was president from 2001 to 2019.

Mahtani said Congolese intelligence had previously told him that Malanga was a former U.S. military officer of Congolese origin; Malanga himself posted online that he had been an Air Force junior ROTC cadet and had led a Congolese military unit. The Washington Post was not immediately able to verify those claims.

Later Sunday, Ekenge, the army spokesman, told the Associated Press that the suspected coup leader, Christian Malanga, was killed at the presidential palace after he resisted arrest by guards.

One of the Americans arrested had a passport in the name of Benjamin Zalman-Polun, according to Congolese television. His social media profiles described him as an American cannabis entrepreneur. In 2014, Zalman-Polun pleaded guilty before a court in Washington to possessing and conspiring to distribute less than 50 kilos of marijuana, court documents showed. A 2022 article in Africa Intelligence connected Zalman-Polun to Malanga’s gold business in Mozambique.

In videos posted on Malanga’s Facebook page and other social media earlier Sunday, men in military uniforms can be seen wandering somewhat aimlessly around the presidential palace, taking down flags, chanting “New Zaire” and filming themselves waving weapons and swearing. There are at least two White men wearing masks. At one point, an American accent off camera says, “It’s jammed”; at another point, someone says in English, “Felix, we’re coming for you n-----” — a racist slur rarely used in Congo.

In most of the videos posted online, the men do not hold their weapons ready; one is leaning against a wall. There is no sign of resistance — or a plan. In another video, a man presumed to be Malanga screams, “Felix, you’re out” while armed men behind him check their phones or adjust their berets before producing a flag associated with Zaire, the country’s former name.

The amateur nature of the coup attempt and the way the group of men were able to access one of Kinshasa’s most heavily guarded government sites with so little resistance provoked many questions among Congo watchers.

“Obviously, Malanga has been used by somebody,” Mahtani said. “There’s many people unhappy with the president inside the Congo and ambitious powers outside the Congo who want him removed — and a lot of it connects to resource ambitions, including gold.”",A police vehicle with 'POLICE' written on it is parked on a street with other vehicles and people in the background.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6B7DBFB550>,2024-05-19 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/05/19/drc-coup-congo-americans-arrested/,['Politics' 'International'],[0.95 0.95],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/dcd9094062.png
000fddd6f0,Financial Times,South Africa’s ‘humbled’ ANC stands by Cyril Ramaphosa - Financial Times,"South Africa’s governing African National Congress admitted it had been “humbled” by its worst general election performance since the first post-apartheid vote 30 years ago, but that it would not be “bullied” into axing President Cyril Ramaphosa.

The election was formally declared on Sunday night, with the ANC winning just 40.2 per cent, a result that one senior party member said had sent “shockwaves” through the organisation. In the end, 58.6 per cent of the 27mn eligible voters cast their ballot.

The centrist Democratic Alliance came in second with 22 per cent. But the big winner was the uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party launched six months ago by former president Jacob Zuma, which surged to 14.6 per cent.

Zuma, who was declared ineligible to stand because of a previous criminal conviction for contempt of court, has said MK would be willing to form a coalition with the ANC, but only if it were to ditch Ramaphosa, with whom he has a vendetta.

The ANC, whose top decision-making body, the National Executive Committee, will meet on Tuesday to conduct an autopsy of its poor performance and discuss coalition options, was resolute this would not happen.

“Ramaphosa is the president of the ANC,” Fikile Mbalula, its secretary-general, said on Sunday. “If you come to us with a demand that Ramaphosa must step down as president, that’s not going to happen.”

Of coalition talks, he said: “We will not be bullied . . . we’ll engage with everybody.”

Analysts say Ramaphosa is under intense pressure after his party suffered a worse than expected 17 percentage point fall, from 57.5 per cent in 2019. This represented “a seismic shift in politics”, said law professor Richard Calland.

One party insider told the Financial Times the ANC needed to rebuild, which would be a “culture shock for many”. But he also said “this talk of Cyril falling on his sword is bullshit”.

Ramaphosa himself appeared for the first time in days on Sunday night, speaking at the closing of the poll by the Electoral Commission (IEC). He said “what this election has made plain is that the people of South Africa expect their leaders to work together” and find common ground — a reference to the new era of coalitions.

Despite calls to quit, Ramaphosa appeared relaxed and unflustered. After one IEC official mistakenly used the word “extinguished” rather than “distinguished”, Ramaphosa joked that “I’m not yet extinguished”.

The MK party’s sudden elevation on to the national stage, based on a radical platform of scrapping the constitution drawn up after apartheid, and nationalising mines and banks, has rattled investment markets.

Economists said the rand, which fell more than 2 per cent after the election to R18.79 to the dollar, was braced for a rocky start to the week.

Despite his party’s strong showing, Zuma has demanded a recount citing irregularities. He also threatened “trouble” if the Electoral Commission declared the final results as planned.

Zuma, who was president in 2009-2018 when state assets were looted, said that would be a “provocation” for his party and 25 others that have also issued objections.

Most independent analysts consider any irregularities minor.

“I am hoping whoever is responsible is hearing us. Don’t start trouble when there is no trouble,” Zuma said.

Many commentators took this as ominous, given the riots that exploded across South Africa in 2021 after he was imprisoned for refusing to take part in a commission of inquiry into the corruption that raged under his presidency.

Mosotho Moepya, chair of the IEC, made no reference to Zuma’s threat as he declared the elections free and fair on Sunday night. Moepya said the IEC itself had also come under fire, withstanding “attempts to undermine the credibility of the institution” and “bare acts of intimidation”.

Herman Mashaba, leader of the ActionSA party, which won 1.2 per cent of the vote, said: “After what happened in July 2021, after he was imprisoned, to use such threats is treasonous. Especially given how the ANC has treated him with kid gloves.”

Mashaba said that, while there had been “glitches”, the election was free and fair. “There is no evidence otherwise,” he said.

On Sunday, DA leader John Steenhuisen said his party had agreed to open “exploratory talks” with parties that “share a commitment to the South African constitution” to form a coalition government and avert a “doomsday coalition” between the ANC, MK Party and EFF.

While these talks would presumably include the ANC, Steenhuisen said it would not include the MK Party and EFF. “Burying our heads in the sand while South Africa faces its greatest threat since the dawn of democracy is not an option,” he said.

Some ANC members are understood to favour a deal with MK and the EFF, but one Ramaphosa ally said they were in a minority.

“We need to put the country first,” the person said. “A majority of sensible people in the ANC will agree with that, but there’s a flip side of those in the NEC who want to create a situation where they can continue to loot. For them this is not about democracy but to create an opportunity to loot and to avoid prosecution.”","A man stands at a podium with a microphone, gesturing with his right hand, in front of a backdrop with the ANC logo and the words 'ANC'.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA41B91E0>,2024-06-02 18:26:47.060000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/95988c12-75c1-4274-abf7-93be100dfaa6,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/000fddd6f0.png
ddb61f7db7,ABC News,"5 things to watch in Tuesday's primaries in Maryland, West Virginia, and Nebraska - ABC News","Even though the general election matchup is already set between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, there have been plenty of fireworks down the ballot ahead of presidential and congressional primaries in Maryland, West Virginia, and Nebraska on Tuesday.

Downballot races in Maryland, for example, have led to bitter intraparty fights and questions over the role of spending in some races; while Senate primaries in West Virginia could offer a glimpse of who might replace retiring Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin. And Biden himself could face another protest vote in Maryland.

Here are 5 things to watch in Tuesday's races.

Who will triumph in the bitter Democratic Senate primary in Maryland, and what role will spending play in the race?

Democrats in Maryland are bracing for the end of what has become a bitter primary between frontrunner candidates Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks and Rep. David Trone, each of whom say they're the better bet to likely take on former Republican Gov. Larry Hogan in November.

Trone, the wealthy founder of Total Wine & More and a congressman in his third term, has injected over $50 million of his own money into the race and flooded local airwaves with advertising. He and groups supporting him have spent at least $45 million on ad reservations in the race, rapidly eclipsing Alsobrooks and groups supporting her, according to tracking from AdImpact.

But the congressman has said that the fact that he can self-finance his run allows Democrats to spend party money in races where they hope to flip seats or hold onto threatened ones. Speaking to reporters last Tuesday, Trone did not want to commit to not taking money from Democratic campaign committees, but said his self-funding ""will give them a lot more flexibility to spend money elsewhere.""

Alsobrooks, meanwhile, has some groups spending heavily to support her run. EMILY's List, a major political action committee that supports pro-abortion access female Democratic candidates, said it is spending over $2 million on airing ads criticizing Trone and has thrown its support behind Alsobrooks in the primary.

""She has a lived experience that is the voice we desperately need in the United States Senate,"" Jessica Mackler, president of EMILY's List, told ABC News in a recent interview.

How will Republican Senate candidate Larry Hogan perform in the Republican primary?

Whoever wins in the primary will likely face popular former Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, whose 11th-hour candidacy turned the race into one with major implications for which party controls the Senate. Hogan launched his Senate bid in February after flirting for months with a third-party presidential bid through No Label's now-discarded efforts to field a ""unity ticket.""

Political experts and observers have said that in spite of his name recognition, Hogan faces a steep uphill battle to flip the seat red -- given that Maryland is a deep-blue bastion.

During a brief interview with ABC News at an early voting location in Potomac, Maryland, Hogan acknowledged the challenge ahead. ""I think we're arguably the bluest state in America … this will be the hardest challenge that I've ever had.""

While Hogan is considered the frontrunner in the Republican primary, it may be worth watching how much vote he picks up from Republican primary voters, and how he does in some parts of the state. Hogan is a sharp critic of former President Donald Trump and presents himself as a moderate conservative – which puts him at odds with Trump's strong support among Republican primary voters.

""Tracking turnout among Republicans will be telling with regard to enthusiasm for Hogan,"" Michael Hanmer, ​the director of the University of Maryland's Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement, told ABC News. ""A relatively high rate of turnout will be a clear signal in his favor given the lack of competition and his critiques of Trump.""

Will heavy outside spending impact the race in Maryland's 3rd Congressional district?

Some Democrats in Maryland have raised concerns about how an outside group is spending millions in the race for Maryland's 3rd Congressional district -- with high-profile candidate and former Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who rose to prominence after being among the officers defending the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, calling the expenditures troubling.

The United Democracy Project (UDP), a super PAC affiliated with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), has spent over $4.2 million in independent expenditures to support one of Dunn's primary opponents, state Senator Sarah Elfreth, according to FEC filings as of May 10. Those expenditures include direct mailings, media placement, media production, and phone banking.

UDP did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News about its spending in support of Elfreth, but the group told Jewish Insider in April that it is not targeting Harry Dunn specifically.

Dunn wrote in a statement in April, ""Our grassroots movement won't be scared off by this dark money spending.""

In response to a request for comment from ABC News about the expenditures from UDP and criticism from other candidates over them, Pat Murray, campaign manager for Sarah Elfreth's campaign, wrote that the campaign is proud of its many Maryland resident donors and support from progressive groups. ""We are disappointed that other candidates launched last minute negative attacks, but that's a clear sign that they know Sarah is the frontrunner and in a strong position to win on Tuesday,"" Murray said.

Who will likely replace retiring Sen. Joe Manchin in Virginia?

The marquee race on Tuesday in West Virginia will be the GOP primary for U.S. Senate, where candidates are vying to replace retiring Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat. Republicans are eyeing the seat as a likely pickup.

The race could also be an indication of whether Republican voters are looking for candidates who frame. Current GOP Gov. Jim Justice, who has portrayed himself as experienced and who netted Donald Trump's endorsement, has a polling and slight fundraising advantage over U.S. Rep. Alex Mooney, who portrays himself as an anti-establishment candidate, ahead of their faceoff.

Before Manchin announced his plans not to seek reelection, the battle for West Virginia's Senate seat was shaping up to be one of the most competitive of the general election cycle. Now, national Democrats are largely remaining on the sidelines.

The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is not endorsing in the race and Steve Daines, chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, called the November contest ""over"" in the majority-Republican state.

Will there be a major 'Uncommitted' protest vote against Joe Biden?

Activists have called on Democratic primary voters in some states to choose the ""uncommitted"" option on their ballot in states that include it, as a way to protest President Joe Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war and support of Israel.

There has been a similar organized effort in Maryland, where ""Uncommitted to any Presidential Candidate"" is an option on the Democratic presidential primary ballot. (Voters will also see Biden, author Marianne Williamson, and now-withdrawn candidate Rep. Dean Phillips.)

""We're urging people to vote 'uncommitted'… because the Biden Administration has not listened to the vast majority of the Democratic voters that want a cease-fire in Gaza,"" Anna Evans-Goldstein, an for the Listen to Maryland campaign, told ABC affiliate WMAR.

The Biden campaign told ABC News in a statement, ""The President believes making your voice heard and participating in our democracy is fundamental to who we are as Americans. He shares the goal for an end to the violence and a just, lasting peace in the Middle East. He's working tirelessly to that end.""

422292ae04,New York Post,"The 11 best books we read in June 2024, ranked and reviewed - New York Post","Peak summer is finally here, which means I’m reading outside. Whether I’m poolside or beachside, a fresh, new paperback is in my hand, my facial sunscreen in the other.

In the spirit of days spent reading underneath the sun’s rays, I resorted to plenty of beach reads this month, more than the usual I’d typically reach for. On a tropical island vacation, I completed three page-turning plot lines (but more on that below).

Whether you’re an avid follower of Reese’s Book Club and Read with Jenna like me, or you simply want to find some hidden gems on the *online* bookshelves, this list is for you. Wonderfully curated, perfect for reading.

RELATED: Best May book releases, ranked by Amazon Books Editors

Ahead, you’ll find full reviews for each book I read in June, along with some commentary from the Amazon Books Editors. You’ll also want to toggle to the end of the list for some additional recommendations, too.

“The Main Character” by Jaclyn Goldis

Fans of Agatha Christie may want to check out this homage to “Murder on the Orient Express.”

In this new page-turner, a reclusive author invites a specially chosen group of people aboard the newly-renovated Orient Express to travel from Cinque Terre to Positano, intending to fictionalize any drama that ensues. It was deeply engaging and set in a glamorous, must-read-about setting. It’s the perfect balance between a picturesque summer novel and an engaging story.

“Pair an original, dramatic plot with interesting characters in a glamorous setting, throw in a dollop of fascinating history and you get a riveting read,” Vannessa Cronin, senior editor at Amazon Books Editorial, exclusively told the New York Post, singing the title’s praises.

“The Perfect Marriage” by Jeneva Rose

Meet one of my five-star reads for 2024: “The Perfect Marriage” by Jeneva Rose. Twisty, riveting and completely un-put-down-able, the story will have you hooked until the very last page. Plus, the ending is one I didn’t naturally suspect, which makes the reading experience that much more spicy.

Not to mention, we love a good courtroom thriller, especially one where it’s not clear who’s innocent or guilty. “Rose really ups the ante here, where a defense attorney has to defend her own husband on charges he murdered his mistress,” Cronin said. “Nobody handles skeletons in the closet with such a chilling effect quite like Geneva Rose. She also excels at devising the kind of twists that you don’t see coming, which makes this the perfect summer read.”

“The Resort” by Sara Ochs

Who doesn’t dream of a fresh start in a tropical paradise? But that fresh start turns nightmarish in Ochs’ twisty thriller, as a series of murders means someone in a group of international expats is having their past catch up to them.

“If you like sun-soaked exotic settings, a large cast of characters with shady pasts, and you like books by Rachel Hawkins or Catherine Steadman, this is the read for you,” Cronin noted, recommending the novel. Nobody can resist a tropical paradise after all, and I enjoyed the unique angle and rich detail set in a summertime-soaked setting.

“Nora Goes Off Script” by Annabel Monaghan

With Annabel Monaghan’s new novel “Summer Romance,” I decided to finally hop on the bandwagon and read her three novels for the ultimate June beach-reading month. It was absolutely delightful, allowing for the perfect escape on a beautiful summer day.

“We binge-read this tale about Nora, a recently divorced scriptwriter,” Cronin began explaining. “When she throws out the formula she uses to write romance scripts for a Hallmark-like channel and writes from her bruised heart, it brings her attention from Hollywood and even a hot movie star who may feature in Nora’s second act.”

This clever, charming rom-com (which is also an Amazon Editors’ pick) about a single mom and her two kids — all apprehensive about risking their hearts again — made the Amazon team “fall hard,” per Cronin.

“Same Time Next Summer” by Annabel Monaghan

Following “Nora Goes Off Script,” Monaghan’s “Same Time Next Summer” was another magical read that has everything you can ask for in a beach read.

With Sam’s life on track — complete with the dreamy doctor fiancé and a fabulous job in Manhattan— she feels as if everything is going to plan. Just as she’s about to tour wedding venues, she runs into her 17-year-old love interest who broke her heart way back when. The rest, you’ll want to read.

“Summer Romance” by Annabel Monaghan

My favorite of Monaghan’s novels is unveiled. “Summer Romance” is like “Grease” in a book, which made me love it so much more. The characters shared an original and captivating love story that felt cozy and whimsical. It has to be one of the best new releases of the summer, by far.

“Annabel Monaghan writes witty, messy, complicated women I want to be friends with,” Abby Abell, senior editor at Amazon Books Editorial, told The Post. “In ‘Summer Romance,’ Ali is a professional organizer whose life is in chaos. But when her friend’s younger brother returns to town, he remembers Ali as the vibrant, fearless girl who he’s always had a crush on; and she starts to remember that girl, too.”

This is a story about what a scary but worthwhile risk love is, in all its many forms. It’s an endearing, charming romantic comedy that was, unsurprisingly, an Amazon Editors’ pick for June.

“Meet Me in Tahiti” by Georgia Toffolo

Not gonna lie, I decided to pick up “Meet Me in Tahiti” by Georgia Toffolo purely based on the title. It’s an empowering, inclusive and lovely beach read that’s sure to be unlike any you’ve read.

This story centers on Zoe, the fun-hearted protagonist who caught herself falling for the bad boys (ahem, Finn). When she got into a car crash at 18 years old, she had to adjust to being unable to walk again.

Flash forward years later, Zoe is a travel writer who’s about to review a luxury hotel. The owner? Finn. That’s truly all you need to know before adding it to your cart and enjoying the summertime thrill this book has to offer.

“This Summer Will Be Different” by Carley Fortune

“This transporting, swoon-worthy romance (and an Amazon Editors’ pick) follows Lucy as she visits Prince Edward Island (PEI) and has an instant connection, and an incredibly sexy night, with local Felix,” Abell shared. “But the world is small, and it turns out that Felix is her best friend Bridget’s brother…and very off limits.”

The longing in this book is matched only by the incredible setting that has just about everyone planning a trip to PEI. It’s aching and beautiful, and another five-star read of mine. Not to mention, Fortune’s best novel yet.

“Malibu Summer” by Libby Gill

If you’re a fan of second-chance romances, try your hand at opposites-attract romance. It couldn’t be more engaging, especially when the dreamy scenery of Malibu is tossed into the mix.

Here, Ivy Bauer is an ambitious soil scientist who’s also the entrepreneur of an organic irrigation system. When her husband is killed in a biking accident, she takes a summer job in Malibu as a gardener, allowing her time to grieve.

She then meets Conrad, a former Hollywood actor, who’s also experiencing grief after the death of his wife. When their paths cross, it’s both an enemies-to-lovers vibe mixed with the most beautiful story.

“The Bridesmaids” by Victoria Jenkins

Wholly on-brand for me as I recently got engaged (and love thrillers), “The Bridesmaids” by Victoria Jenkins couldn’t have been a more “ooh, I’ll pick this up” novel.

Holly is getting married and there’s a bachelorette party. But then, one body among the group is found and a bridesmaid is the killer. It was a bit seemingly out-of-reach at times, but boy did it create a captivating story from beginning to end.

“Swan Song” by Elin Hilderbrand

Me: *cries because this is Elin Hilderbrand’s last novel.*

I can’t begin to describe how phenomenal this beach read is. It’s the fourth installment of the author’s beaming Nantucket series, with each one better than the next. Not to mention, Hilderbrand is the Queen of the Beach Read, so this new summer release is one that’ll keep you turning each page and fantasizing about every sweltering day of summer.

Other June Books to read, per the Amazon Books Editorial team

“James” by Percival Everett

“With the same fiery wit, snap and energy of his previous work, Percival Everett brings to life a retelling of ‘Adventures of Huckleberry Finn‘ and, in so doing, delivers an entirely new classic, one that is rip-roaringly American, wry and hard-hitting,” Al Woodworth, senior editor at Amazon Books Editorial, shared.

It’s a knock-out, and it was also the Amazon Books Editorial team’s unanimous pick for the No.1 Best Book of the Year So Far, which the team just announced.

“The Women” by Kristin Hannah

One of the Amazon Editors’ favorite novels of 2024 so far, Kristin Hannah’s “The Women,” has just as much emotional heft as her best-selling “The Nightingale.”

“It’s a story that honors the combat nurses who served in Vietnam, and in doing so, expands the definition of what a war hero is,” Erin Kodicek, senior editor at Amazon Books Editorial, shared. It was also one of my favorite of Hannah’s books that I read this year.

“All the Worst Humans: How I Made News for Dictators, Tycoons and Politicians” by Phil Elwood

“This wild, oh-my-God memoir will make your jaw drop,” Woodworth said. “A public relations hit man dishes on all of his dirty deeds and it’s not only impossible to put down, it’s impossible not to talk about.”

In other words, it’s the perfect summer nonfiction reading and why it’s Amazon’s No. 1 nonfiction pick for the Best Book of the Year So Far.

“The Ministry of Time” by Kaliane Bradley

Amazon’s No. 4 pick for Best Book of the Year So Far is Kaliane Bradley’s awe-inducing debut that’s a time travel-spy thriller-government conspiracy-love story, and so much more.

“In a near-future London, a time travel device is discovered by a top-secret agency that uses it to bring back ‘expats’ from different times in history,” Abell explained. “This genre-bending novel explores humanity in all its frailty and potential, and how love can alter the course of history. It’s a fantastical novel that’s funny, riveting, heartbreaking and unputdownable.”

c7a1b2e0f7,The Guardian US,Trump picks a pointless fight with Georgia Republicans – it could cost him - The Guardian US,"All Donald Trump had to do on Saturday in Georgia is show up, bring the tent together and not pick a fight with other Republicans. It might have been money in the bag.

Instead, Trump attacked Governor Brian Kemp, who is substantially more popular in Georgia than he is. Early in his comments, Trump pointed to a few recent high-profile murders in Atlanta, saying: “Atlanta is like a killing field, and your governor should get off his ass and do something about it.”

Trump was just warming up. In between praising three Republicans on the election board who are supposed to be neutral arbiters of election practices, and repeating a bizarre, false and previously debunked claim that Al Capone faced fewer indictments than he did, Trump went on an 11-minute tirade about Kemp and the secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, with a side jab at the attorney general, Chris Carr, for spite. None of them attended the rally.

Trump appeared at the Georgia state convocation center on Saturday probably because it’s a controlled and covered venue, as opposed to the open-air staging area where he was shot three weeks ago. The Secret Service has reportedly advised him to stop outdoor rallies.

The facility is also owned by a state agency, Georgia State University. Georgia law requires any government facility used by a political candidate to be offered to opponents on the same terms.

And it was offered to the vice-president, Kamala Harris, last Tuesday, where she packed the stadium with supporters. (And yes, it was packed, and no, people did not start leaving en masse after Megan Thee Stallion’s brief performance before Harris took the stage.)

Trump’s appearance was also packed to the rim, at least up until an hour into his 90-minute rambling speech when people started heading for the door. Trump speeches are long-winded, rambling and generally offensive. It’s an act, and the Maga faithful enjoy the spectacle.

But Maga is not a majority in Georgia, if anywhere. Republicans cannot win this state when conventional conservatives abandon the party, as Herschel Walker’s Trump-inflected US Senate challenge against Raphael Warnock demonstrated two years ago.

Georgia’s split-ticket-voting conservatives love Kemp and are indifferent at best to Trump. And Trump gave them no love on Saturday.

“If it wasn’t for me, he wouldn’t be your governor. I think everybody knows that,” Trump bloviated, describing them as disloyal.

“Governor Kemp, and Raffensperger, are doing everything possible to make 2024 difficult for Republicans to win. Why do they do it? I don’t know. They’ve got something in mind. You know, they’ve got a little something in mind. Kemp is very bad for the Republican party.”

Then Trump went after Kemp’s wife, who told people she wrote her husband’s name in for president in the Republican presidential primary this year. “I haven’t earned her endorsement? I have nothing to do with her. Somewhere he went bad. And you know what? Your numbers in Georgia are very average. Your economic numbers, your crime numbers, all of your numbers are very average. You can do a lot better and you’ll do a lot better with a better governor.”

On and on. He said Kemp wasn’t supporting the ticket, that he wanted Trump to lose, and complained that Kemp had not, somehow, acted to rein in the prosecution by the Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, never mind the limits of the law. “Kemp doesn’t want to end it. Because he’s a bad guy. He’s a disloyal guy. And he’s a very average governor.”

To be fair, Georgia’s economic and crime numbers are in the middle of the pack. But Georgia’s economic growth has outpaced US growth since Kemp took office, something Republicans attribute to him being the first governor to end lockdowns during the pandemic. Georgia is one of 17 states with a Fitch AAA bond rating. The state has $16bn saved right now because state revenue has consistently outstripped projections, an unprecedented sum that itself presents a kind of political headache for a conservative.

By Republican standards, Georgia has been exceptionally well run.

This is why Kemp can win Georgia while Trump and Trump-lite candidates lose it. Kemp beat Stacey Abrams, who had deep fundraising pockets and a national media profile, by seven points in 2022. On the same ballot, Walker, who has universal name recognition in Georgia, lost to Warnock by three points.

Under conditions of supercharged turnout, that 10-point gap is the difference between winning and losing Georgia. It is a measure of Maga power here. It is why Trump narrowly lost this state in 2020, even as other Republicans won statewide races.

Close observers know the math. Every year, demographic change from people moving into the state shifts Georgia about half a point toward Democrats. But Biden had lost most of the support of Kemp-Warnock split-ticket Republicans. Biden was down six points in Georgia polls.

If Harris picks those voters up again, Trump could lose Georgia by as much as four points, never mind expectations of increased Black voter support for either candidate.

“In 2020, Trump lost the state by less than 12,000 votes and 30,000+ refused to vote for president,” wrote the conservative Georgia talkshow host Erick Erickson on Sunday.

“Attacking a guy who has endorsed you, whose ground game you need to win in 2024, is not wise. Luckily for Trump, Kemp is not a petty man. Unfortunately for Trump, he’s reminding those 40,000+ voters who wouldn’t vote for him in 2020 in Georgia why they didn’t vote for him.”

On Saturday, Trump handed his opponents soundbites about what he thinks about Georgia, its popular governor, and how he expects the state election board to overturn an election he may lose, that will be replayed on YouTube ads on every iPhone between the Fox Theater and the Lake Lanier for the next 91 days.

And Republican political professionals know it.

“Trump has a political death wish in Georgia,” wrote the political messaging guru Frank Luntz, pointedly noting how Trump in effect told Republican voters to blow off the Senate runoff in January 2021 because he was claiming the Georgia election was rigged.

“Attacking Brian Kemp, the popular governor who defeated his hand-picked GOP primary challenger by 70-30, is so stupid. Republicans cannot win if they are divided, yet Trump continues to divide them.”

Within hours, Republican leaders began making statements.

“My focus is on winning this November and saving our country from Kamala Harris and the Democrats – not engaging in petty personal insults, attacking fellow Republicans, or dwelling on the past,” Kemp wrote in a short statement on X. “You should do the same, Mr President, and leave my family out of it.”

“Governor Kemp has been a proven leader, consistent conservative, and champion for Georgia families,” said state representative Jon Burns, Georgia’s speaker. “We’ll continue to work together to make Georgia the best place to live, work and raise a family.”

Trump cannot help himself when it comes to Atlanta, even now, with the state and his political future on the line. Trump attacked Atlanta’s late, beloved congressman John Lewis in 2017, shortly after the inauguration, describing the city as “crime-infested”.

It’s comments like this that supercharged Democratic turnout in 2020 and cost him the state.

Nonetheless, ahead of his surrender on racketeering and election interference charges in Atlanta last year, Trump described Atlanta in similar terms. “Murder and other Violent Crimes have reached levels never seen before,” he wrote, claiming that Willis “has allowed Murder and other Violent Crime to MASSIVELY ESCALATE”.

He wrote that Atlanta was experiencing a “GIANT MURDER WAVE!” and that Willis “is overseeing one of the greatest Murder and Violent Crime DISASTERS in American History”.

None of that was true. All of it was infuriating, in ways that cost Trump at the polls.

“The state leans Republican right now and leans Trump, but there are 90 days for Trump to further screw it up,” Erickson wrote.","A blurred image of a person with a microphone, with the logo of 'The Guardian' visible in the bottom right corner.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BCC1FB9D0>,2024-08-05 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/05/trump-atlanta-rally-brian-kemp-republicans,['Politics' 'Local/Regional'],[0.9 0.8],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/c7a1b2e0f7.png
528d0ce308,ABC News,"How Americans feel about book bans, restrictions: Survey - ABC News","As schools and libraries across the country face record-breaking attempts to remove books from shelves, most Americans are opposed to book restrictions in public schools, according to a new survey.

In 2023, the American Library Association (ALA) documented 4,240 unique book titles targeted for censorship, as well as 1,247 demands to censor library books, materials and resources.

The targeting of unique book titles increased by 65% from 2022 to 2023, reaching the highest level ever documented by ALA.

These efforts have increased alongside state legislation restricting certain school content on topics like race, sex, gender and more.

However, a new study by the Knight Foundation – a nonprofit that provides grants for journalism and the arts – found that two-thirds of Americans oppose efforts to restrict books. There are more strong opponents than strong supporters of book restrictions, with a 3-1 divide among respondents.

The study found that 62% of Americans oppose their state government legislating what content is allowable in school books.

Public school parents are more likely to be in favor of book restrictions, but more than half of parents (59%) still oppose book restrictions. This is lower than the 67% opposition rate among non-parents.

About 7% of parents with reading-age children reported their child reading an age-inappropriate book from school, and 25% of pre-K-12 parents are concerned about this happening in the future.

Classroom or library content restrictions are often based on concerns about what is deemed “age-appropriate” for certain ages -- as is the case in legislation in Florida, Utah, Texas and other states.

More survey participants said it is a bigger concern to restrict students’ access to books that have educational value than it is for them to have access to books that have inappropriate content, especially when it comes to students in middle school and high school.

Six in 10 survey respondents saw age appropriateness as a legitimate reason to restrict students’ book access. However, the report found that far fewer say it is legitimate to block access to books that contradict parents’ political views, religious beliefs or moral values.

Most public school parents are confident in the appropriateness of their school’s book selections. The study also found that 78% of all adults say they are confident that their community’s public schools select appropriate books for students to read.

Though the public feels strongly about the issue -- 62% call it highly important -- very few have taken action themselves on the issue. Only 3% have personally engaged in the debate, according to the report -- 2% engaging to maintain access and 1% to restrict access.

Conservatives are over-represented in the support for book restrictions, making up 57% of book restriction supporters but only 27% of all adults, according to the Knight Foundation. Conservatives are also less likely to feel politically represented in public school books.","A bookshelf filled with various books, including 'The Hunger Games', 'Out of Darkness', and 'The Color Purple'.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA3F805B0>,2024-08-21 11:59:00+00:00,https://abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/US/americans-feel-book-bans-restrictions-survey/story?id=112991794,['Politics' 'National' 'Other'],[0.85 0.8  0.65],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/528d0ce308.png
aaf2697428,Financial Times,Spending watchdog questions UK investment in European Space Agency - Financial Times,"The UK’s spending watchdog has questioned whether Britain’s investment in the European Space Agency is delivering value for money, after noting that the country received a lower return than France, Germany and Italy over most of the last decade.

The National Audit Office on Tuesday published a highly critical assessment of progress on implementing the UK’s national space strategy, unveiled in 2021 by the previous Conservative government. While directing space spending through the ESA “gives UK space companies and academics access to large-scale space programmes which would be challenging to replicate nationally,” the report said, “the UK does not yet receive contracts . . . proportionate to the value of the funding [it] provides.”

In addition to questioning the returns from ESA membership, the NAO said a lack of clarity and detail in the national space strategy was undermining the UK’s ambition to expand its space economy. Three years after unveiling the strategy, the UK Space Agency and the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology were still in the early stages of “identifying and developing the plans and capabilities needed to deliver the strategy’s ambitions”.

The NAO’s findings will rekindle a debate about the value of ESA membership after British companies were excluded from bidding for contracts on navigation service Galileo and the Copernicus earth observation project as a result of Brexit.

Although UK companies are again eligible for Copernicus contracts since January, many in the space sector have been lobbying for a strong national programme to accelerate growth in areas where the UK has expertise, such as earth observation and data analytics.

“We still do not have a big national project that industry can focus on,” said one veteran space industry executive.

ESA acts as the procurement agency for the EU, but is an independent intergovernmental organisation that pools investment in big scientific and public space programmes. Its 22 members include non-EU nations such as the UK, Canada and Norway.

Britain is the fourth largest contributor to ESA, accounting for about 9 per cent of its non-EU funding. Roughly three-quarters of the UKSA’s budget goes to ESA programmes and in 2022 the previous government pledged £1.84bn in funding between 2023 and 2027.

The ESA aims for member states to receive the equivalent of their funding pledges in contracts to industry and academia, minus a small deduction for overheads. A confidential report by the UKSA’s executive committee found that between the final quarter of 2015 and February 2023 the UK received 93p back in contracts for every £1 allocated to the ESA.

The NAO notes that the UKSA has made efforts to boost the returns, helping companies to identify opportunities and to submit applications. By the end of last year the return had improved to 96p on the pound, “but this means UK industry and academia are still not benefiting in terms of contract value from the full funding given to ESA by UKSA,” the NAO said.

“France, Germany and Italy achieved values between 0.99 and 1.02,” the report added.

David Parker, ESA’s Director of Human and Robotic Exploration until 2023, told the Financial Times that the UK received substantially more economic value from its ESA membership than was accounted for by contract awards. “The UK has had a larger share of the return on science programmes,” Parker said.

Parker said some of the deficit reflected a “change in the UK industrial landscape. Some of the capabilities have changed.” But work was being done to educate companies about the opportunities and procedures. “It will come back again,” he said.

The UKSA said it was working to improve the returns, with a target to reach parity by the end of this year. “We are making good progress,” the agency said.

Josef Aschbacher, director-general of the ESA, told an audience at the Farnborough air show that the agency was taking steps to “give more energy” to its UK based centre focused on satellite applications and telecommunications.","An image of a satellite with solar panels and a yellow circular object with multiple smaller yellow objects inside, set against a dark space backdrop.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA2ECBD00>,2024-07-23 12:32:48.958000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/2a6ea8b5-b61c-4e7b-959e-a6ebeca22fa7,['National' 'Science'],[0.85 0.75],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/aaf2697428.png
9f7833be1f,The Associated Press,Court cases lead to new voting districts in some states. Could it affect control of Congress? - The Associated Press,"Since most Americans last voted for Congress, thousands of people have been added to certain voting districts — and subtracted from others — under new political maps enacted following court rulings. The sum of that redistricting math, assuming no major political shift in either major party’s direction, figures to provide at least a one-seat gain for Republicans in November’s U.S. House elections. But that equation could flip to Democrats’ favor depending on what happens in an ongoing effort to reshape New York’s congressional districts. House boundaries redrawn before the 2022 elections based on the last decennial census have been redrawn again ahead of the 2024 elections in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and North Carolina. New York could be next. A bipartisan commission is to release a revised plan for New York’s districts by Feb. 28. Republicans hold a narrow 219-213 House majority over Democrats, with vacancies in three seats previously held by the GOP. A special election for one of those — to replace ousted Rep. George Santos of New York — will be held Feb. 13. Here’s a look at how voting districts have changed — or could change — before the November elections and what affect that could have on the battle for control of Congress. SOUTHERN SWINGS A U.S. Supreme Court ruling last June about minority voting rights paved the way for new districts in Alabama and Louisiana. In each state, the result is that Black voters will have a better opportunity to elect the candidate of their choice in two congressional districts instead of one. Democrats are expected to gain one seat in Alabama and one more in Louisiana in the November elections.

Read the latest: Follow AP’s complete coverage of this year’s election. A similar court ruling also forced the Republican-led General Assembly to redraw districts in Georgia. But the new map there isn’t expected to change the state’s proportion of nine Republican and five Democratic representatives. Democratic gains in Alabama and Louisiana are likely to be offset in North Carolina, where Republicans could win at least three additional seats under revised districts. The Republican-led General Assembly in October approved a more GOP-friendly map after a new Republican majority of the state Supreme Court reversed decisions by the previously Democratic-majority court that had led to districts won by seven Democrats and seven Republicans in the 2022 elections. NEW YORK’S UNCERTAINTY The Republicans’ slight edge from redistricting changes made so far could be wiped out and transformed into a small Democratic advantage if new House districts are adopted in New York. After a bipartisan commission failed to agree on districts based on the 2020 census, the Democratic-led New York Legislature passed a plan that got struck down in court as a partisan gerrymander. The courts then imposed districts for the 2022 elections, which resulted in a fairly close split of 15 Democrats and 11 Republicans. But more litigation ensued, and the state’s highest court ordered the bipartisan commission to make another attempt at new districts. The commission has until the end of this month to submit a plan to the Legislature, which could approve it or reject it and instead pass its own redistricting plan. Either scenario opens the potential for Democrats to gain multiple seats. WHAT ABOUT OTHER STATES? Redistricting litigation also is ongoing in several other states, but none seem as likely as New York to affect the 2024 elections. Perhaps the most notable is Florida, where a trial judge in September ruled that U.S. House districts pushed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis violated the state constitution by diminishing the ability of Black voters in northern Florida to elect the candidate of their choice. A state appeals court reversed that ruling in December. The Florida Supreme Court has agreed to consider the case but has set a briefing schedule for attorneys that makes it unlikely for the case to be decided by the April qualifying period for candidates to appear on the primary ballot. Litigation over congressional districts also is lingering in Arkansas, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin. WILL NEW DISTRICTS MAKE A DIFFERENCE? Redistricting changes since the 2022 elections could help Democrats or Republicans win control of Congress because “it’s a very closely contested congressional map, and every seat or two matters,” said Chris Warshaw, a political science professor at George Washington University who focuses on redistricting. But other factors are likely to play a bigger role, Warshaw said. Voting patterns show a strong correlation between presidential and congressional elections, meaning whichever party wins the presidency has a good chance of also winning the House. Voters’ perceptions about the economy and other issues also matter. And retirements could put certain House seats into play that otherwise may have been won by incumbents. The reshaping of voting districts matters, but doesn’t necessarily pre-determine the outcome of elections. “Redistricting can help create a stronger base for candidates to run their campaigns on,” said Jeffrey Wice, director of the New York Law School’s Census and Redistricting Institute. “But the candidates have to perform, and the issues have to work in their favor.”",An elderly woman is seen casting her vote at a polling station with a 'VOTE' sign and American flags in the background.,<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BA3E552A0>,2024-02-06 14:53:31+00:00,https://apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-redistricting-house-congress-067d1c8c73f93f38cc5cfc9c62e30c25,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Unlikely,Likely,sample_review/images/9f7833be1f.png
88545f273d,Forbes,Students Are Considering Campus Gun Policies In College Selection - Forbes,"Gun violence is dominating headlines again and polling suggests incoming college students are acutely aware of the policies that will determine their exposure to weapons when they arrive on campus in the fall.

According to Lumina Foundation and Gallup, eight in 10 current and prospective students say campus gun policies are important in their enrollment decisions. The 2024 State of Higher Education Study found students prefer restrictive gun policies by a 5-to-1 margin. Democrats reportedly considered gun policies a higher priority in their college selection process than Republicans did by nine percentage points, but more than three quarters of respondents across all party affiliations consider it important.

Americans entering college in the fall grew up conducting active shooter drills throughout their K-12 education and amid a dramatic uptick in mass shootings over the past 10 years, according to Statista data.

For many, this will also be the first presidential election in which they can vote and their strong opinions about gun policy could be reflected in the results.

“Gun safety will always be on the minds of young voters when they step into the ballot box. It consistently ranks as a top issue for us – no matter the election,” says Avi Rubin, a volunteer leader with the Students Demand Action chapter at Arizona State University. “When gun violence is the leading cause of death for our generation, we can’t afford to vote for candidates that aren’t fully committed to advancing gun safety policies.”

Rubin spent much of his spring semester working to defeat a bill in Arizona that would allow concealed carry on college campuses. Senate Bill 1198 would have allowed anyone with a valid concealed carry permit to carry a weapon on campus, and it would have banned colleges from implementing stronger gun safety rules that go farther. The bill passed both legislative bodies, but was ultimately vetoed by Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs.

“As a residential assistant for student housing on my campus, the absolute last thing I wanted to worry about was whether students were carrying guns in the dorms,” said Rubin.

There are currently 11 states that allow campus carry, according to Campus Safety Magazine. At least 21 states allow colleges and universities to set their own campus carry rules. There are 18 states that prohibit campus carry altogether. Within each of these categories, there are policy variations as well. For example, Alabama allows for schools to determine their own policies, but as of 2023, schools must allow students to keep firearms in their vehicles; and in Tennessee, only faculty members with licenses may carry weapons on campus, but not students or the general public.

Campus Safety Magazine noted with these listings that many states are becoming more flexible in their permitting laws.

There is precedent for keeping guns out of college. James Madison and Thomas Jefferson had guns banned from the University of Virginia in 1824, arguing in a University Board of Visitors meeting that the Second Amendment did not apply to college campuses.

When Georgia Governor Nathan Deal vetoed a bill in 2016 that would have allowed campus carry, he invoked the logic of those founders, writing in his veto, “The approval of these specific prohibitions relating to ‘campus carry’ by the principal author of the Declaration of Independence, and the principal author of the United States Constitution should not only dispel any vestige of constitutional privilege but should illustrate that having college campuses free of weapons has great historical precedent.” (The Georgia Office of the Governor has since removed the text of the veto, but a full version can be found in USA Today’s coverage of the event.)

When asked about college students’ concerns over guns on campus, the NRA stressed the need to focus on mental health and individual responsibility.

“Any object in the hands of a criminal or a mentally ill person with a propensity for violence has the potential of being used to harm others,” says NRA spokesperson Nick Perrine. “The country needs to better enforce existing laws and needs to have a comprehensive plan for the dangerously mentally ill so they get the help they need and aren't recycled into society where they may end up hurting themselves or others.”

In the wake of the attempted assassination of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, there is renewed focus on the laws that determine who has access to firearms. Trump’s would-be assassin used an AR-15 rifle in his assault on the former president — the same weapon used in high profile tragedies like the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre and the 2022 school shooting in Uvalde, Texas.

As the Associated Press has reported, the AR-15 has achieved iconic status in the U.S. thanks to years of savvy marketing campaigns and favorable cultural conditions. A 2023 bill introduced to Congress would even designate the rifle as the “National Gun of the United States.”

It seems that there are now two competing currents in the U.S. around guns: an increasingly permissive legal and cultural landscape and a heightened concern among young Americans about gun violence.

Avi Rubin of Students Demand Action stressed that the push for gun control is more mainstream than that.

“The overwhelming majority of Americans want gun safety laws, and what’s keeping us from achieving that goal are politicians hell-bent on carrying out the gun lobby’s agenda,” he says. “So when voters head to polls in November, I hope they vote like their lives depend on it – because they do.”","A group of students in red and black uniforms posing in front of a large 'DON'T LOCK AWAY' sign, with the U.S. Capitol building in the background.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BA24E9A80>,2024-07-19 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.forbes.com,https://www.forbes.com/sites/meglittlereilly/2024/07/19/campus-gun-policies-are-influencing-admissions-decisions/,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/88545f273d.png
922d940fab,National Review,Telling the Fracking Truth about Harris - National Review,"I’m going to excerpt the relevant part of the CNN interview and intersperse comments.

BASH: I want to get some clarity on where you stand on some key policy issues. Energy is a big one. In — when you were in Congress, you supported the Green New Deal. And in 2019 you said, quote, “There is no question I’m in favor of banning fracking.” Fracking, as you know, is a pretty big issue, particularly in your must-win state of Pennsylvania.

HARRIS: Sure.

BASH: Do you still want to ban fracking?

HARRIS: No, and I made that clear on the debate stage in 2020, that I would not ban fracking. As vice president, I did not ban fracking. As president, I will not ban fracking.

What Harris actually said in the 2020 vice-presidential debate: “Joe Biden will not end fracking. He has been very clear about that.” And: “I will repeat, and the American people know, that Joe Biden will not ban fracking. That is a fact. That is a fact.” Either her memory is failing her about what she said in 2020, or she is lying.

BASH: In 2019, I believe in a town hall you said — you were asked, “Would you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking on your first day in office?” and you said, “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking. So yes.” So it changed in — in that campaign?

HARRIS: In 2020 I made very clear where I stand. We are in 2024, and I have not changed that position, nor will I going forward. I kept my word, and I will keep my word.

She didn’t give her word in 2020. But if you take her at her current, actual words, she is saying that she changed her position between 2019 and 2020 but won’t change it again.

BASH: What made you change that position at the time?

HARRIS: Well, let’s be clear. My values have not changed. I believe it is very important that we take seriously what we must do to guard against what is a clear crisis in terms of the climate. And to do that, we can do what we have accomplished thus far.

Here she is saying that what we must do is to do what we have already done. Continuing with Harris:

The Inflation Reduction Act, what we have done to invest by my calculation over t— probably a trillion dollars over the next ten years investing in a clean energy economy. What we’ve already done creating over 300,000 new clean energy jobs. That tells me from my experience as vice president we can do it without banning fracking.

In fact, Dana — Dana, excuse me [she mispronounced Bash’s name the first time and quickly corrected herself]— I cast the tie-breaking vote that actually increased leases for fracking as vice president. So I’m very clear about where I stand.

BASH: And was there some policy or scientific data that you saw that you said, “Oh, okay. I get it now”?

HARRIS: What I have seen is that we can — we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking.

Harris adviser Brian Fallon says of this portion, “VP Harris explains shifts away from 2019 positions on Green New Deal and fracking by noting how the Biden admin’s clean energy investments have proven the ability to make progress on climate without those past stances.” But this makes no sense. Something Harris learned between 2022 and now cannot explain a shift she made between 2019 and 2020.

Besides, why didn’t she realize in 2019 that it was possible to spend a gob of money on clean energy without banning fracking? What was necessary for her to learn? Other, that is, than that you could get the Democratic nomination without standing for a fracking ban.","A woman in a white blazer stands at a podium with a microphone, gesturing with her right hand.

5d05a382ad,Financial Times,The doom loop of modern politics - Financial Times,"The last time a US president was almost assassinated, most of the rich world, while reviling the act, could hope it was peculiarly American. And so it is worth listing a few of the safety measures employed by British MPs in recent years. Mobile panic alarms. Stab-proof vests. Personal guards. An avoidance of planned events and inessential outings. A national police effort called Operation Bridger, now widened to protect elected representatives beyond parliament.

A country where political violence was rare, at least outside the war-like context of the Troubles, has lost two MPs to murderers since 2016. Candidates in the recent French elections came under assault, too. The German interior minister cites an “escalation of anti-democratic violence”.

Almost everyone deplores such attacks. The problem is, after that, the consensus flakes. The spectrum of behaviour that goes up to, but not over, the line of violence inspires less concern or even interest than it should. The harassment of candidates in Britain’s election has been met with a sinister breeziness. To be clear, then: the anti-politician culture is wrong in and of itself. But more than that, it is self-reinforcing.

This is the doom loop of modern politics: it is an ever more unpleasant line of work, which means fewer good people choose it, which depletes the quality of public life — that is, governance itself and the comportment of those responsible for it — which in turn makes voters more hostile to politicians. And back around again.

There is no separating the question of, say, how a nation of more than 330mn people comes to field an 81-year-old against a 78-year-old in a presidential race, from the threats to public officials and general arduousness of “frontline politics”. (What a martial connotation that phrase now has.) Think there should be better people in politics? Well, after you, reader.

The point applies even more in that vacuum of deference we call the UK. The speed with which Rishi Sunak, who might have made a good prime minister with another decade’s seasoning, entered 11 and then 10 Downing Street, testifies to his drive, yes, but also to the awesome dreadfulness of the competition.

Actual violence is worse than intimidation, which is worse than verbal abuse, which is worse than invasive attention, which is worse than the reflexive, almost rote-learned cynicism that is now the routine lot of the politician in front of a public audience (“Why should I believe a word you say?” etc). But all have the same effect. All deter able individuals — whom we might define as those with good career options elsewhere — or even just well-adjusted, non-masochistic ones. The danger is that politics becomes a sort of clearing house for people who wouldn’t attain similar status in another field or who crave attention, however savage. It is tempting here to invert the over-quoted Groucho Marx line about clubs and members. Parliament shouldn’t accept anyone who would consider joining it.

This argument will always incur the complaint of romanticising the past. There is no objective measure of the “quality” of politicians, let alone one that conclusively shows that it has worsened. Nor is it an axiom that a person of high general competence will thrive in the peculiar realm of politics. Robert McNamara was a jewel of his American generation — Harvard Business School star, Ford Motor Company whizz — and a tragically fumbling Pentagon chief during the Vietnam war. John Major’s UK cabinet of the 1990s was stuffed with people who would have (and often had) flourished in academic, entrepreneurial or professional life. Voters hated it.

Over a long enough period, though, a nation is better — rather than worse — run if people with other career opportunities spurn them for politics. The obsessive will always volunteer. The apathetic never will. It is the marginal case, the waverer who has a life of prosperous anonymity open to them, who must be enticed.

It is natural to attribute the anti-politician mood to governmental failures: the botched wars, the misregulation of banks, the British state’s formidable achievement of rising taxes and deteriorating outcomes. There isn’t anything like the same curiosity about the source of those failures. What if the causal link runs the other way? What if an inept state is the ultimate fruit of anti-politics? Is Congress the least trusted institution in American surveys because it is so bad, or so bad because it is mistrusted, and therefore daunting to those who might otherwise enter and elevate it? Deride the political class. It’s a right. But the joke, in the end, is on us.","A man in a suit is being held up by others, with a bloodied face, in a crowded setting.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6B7DE406A0>,2024-07-16 12:06:04.326000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/81614cb1-162e-400e-9d7e-f6ee22e3eafc,['Politics' 'Opinion/Editorial'],[0.95 0.9 ],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/5d05a382ad.png
2033f2ac1e,Financial Times,The secret Hong Kong garden that’s a portal to the past - Financial Times,"There are several herb gardens in Hong Kong. There is one in the Botanical Gardens, close to the seat of government. There is another in the Chinese University of Hong Kong, an institution traceable in part to the revolution of 1949, when mainland scholars were scattered to the four winds. But the one that always caught my attention is tucked away, on one of the many paths winding through the Lung Fu Shan Country Park.

With its abundant references to medicine, the garden at first glance seems like a portal into another era. In the English-speaking world, while herbs still adorn the kitchen shelf, their relationship with healing has taken on archaic associations. In China, where the very word is often expressed through the characters for “medicine” and “grass”, several hundreds of herbs still play an important role in traditional healthcare practices. But few young people nowadays could name many of them, or would come across them.

If gardens exist on a spectrum, this one is on the wilder end and, as though in concert with the forgetting of their names, the herbs have not always seemed in their best state. Last winter, to the extent that it occurs in Hong Kong, nettles had sprouted and the loose grass was trampled. The pots were weathered, and some had fallen over. Only a few flashes of purple — possibly thistles — broke up a jumble of stalks and leaves.

Over four years of occasionally passing the garden, I had never before seen anyone tending to it. But this time there were two men, one middle-aged and one elderly, and at least a foot shorter. Many of the herbs had been stolen in the past few years, explained Alfred Ho, 54, the younger of the two.

They were part of the walking group that had established the garden decades earlier. A small wooden stand on the premises displayed laminated cards of various herbs: firecracker vine, which is sweet and neutral; Chinese mesona, which is bland and cold; and white mugwort. There was artillery clearweed, goosegrass, four-o’clock, peppermint, xiao qing and sea cups.

“Use only as prescribed by the physician,” a sign said.

The other gardener, who was born in 1934, did not speak a word of English, and his native Cantonese seemed to be rooted in the land itself. There was an unmistakable cheerfulness about him, as though he were in just the right place. Chan Siun-kuen, as it turns out, knows all about herbs.

“I want more and more people to know [about them],” he later told me.

Nicolette Perry, who has a PhD in pharmacognosy (the study of medicine from natural sources), runs the Dilston Physic Garden in Northumberland, which has around 700 medicinal plants. She recalls being “amazed” on a trip to Kenya last year; there were “five-year olds saying ‘I’d take this tree and take this leaf and prepare it and drink it’”. But of Dilston’s estimated 2,000 visitors a year, “many are unaware of the traditional and modern uses” of herbs, she says, especially compared with other countries.

The UK, which now displays herbs largely for ornamental or educational purposes, is just one example of a wider disconnection. It “used to have its own huge historical indigenous knowledge” of herbs, but this was “essentially lost” after the chemical revolution of the 19th century.

“We’ve moved from rural to urban areas,” she says. “That’s also added to our lack of knowledge. We haven’t been able to grow them [in quantity or variety] like we used to.”

Chan Siun-kuen had followed that trajectory himself, having moved to the urban metropolis of Hong Kong from rural southern China in 1949, when he was still a teenager. It wasn’t until his forties, after 25 years working in a print manufacturing company, that he began to rediscover the countryside.

In the 1970s, the territory’s industrial boom, which later spread to mainland China, led to worsening pollution. Chan took up hiking in the hills, finding in his fellow walkers a shared enthusiasm for the area’s plant life. He had also started to volunteer for the district council, helping with fire prevention. “At that time, many of the buildings were still made of wood,” he recalls.

The area in which he hiked, now full of well-marked trails leading up to Victoria Peak, was a different matter back then. The landscape was frequented by the triads, a set of powerful underground societies that operated outside of the law. They laid out furniture and offered breakfast, lunch, dinner and, for a fee, games of mah-jong. When the government wanted to establish a country park in the late 1990s, Chan, who had been hiking past them for years, became a middleman.

“It was very complex,” he says. He told the triads the government’s new country park would be “for the people”, and they “are not the enemy of the people”. Eventually, they moved out.

By now more and more people hiked in the morning: there was a group, the Morning Walkers’ Association, of which Chan was appointed chair in 1999. Around a 10-minute walk from the mah-jong tables they planted a garden, with the assistance of the Hong Kong government and Hong Kong University, to promote herbs and Chinese medicine. They established “around 300 species”, says Ning Wang, assistant professor in the School of Chinese Medicine, who was involved in the project about a decade ago.

Today, labels feature Latin, English and Chinese descriptions. Cactus, for example, is written as “angel’s palm”, and is described as “bitter”, “cold” and “moving qi and activating blood”. The language draws on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, which is still widely used in pharmacies on the mainland. Many cards include the character qi, which Wang says is considered as “the foundation that builds our body” in Chinese medicine.

For Chan, this was not new territory. “After I started the garden,” he says, “I learnt about Chinese herbs again.”

As a young child, the hills Chan Siun-kuen used to climb in Guangdong were different from those of Hong Kong. He used to go with his father, who previously worked as a bone-setting doctor, treating dislocations. But given food shortages caused by the Japanese invasions of the 1930s, he instead needed to work as a farmer.

He would point out and collect herbs as they walked. There was a large herb shop in Guangzhou that he sometimes visited, Chan tells me.

Traditional medicine, which goes back “thousands of years”, is “closely related to Chinese history and Chinese culture”, says Wang. Shennong, one of the mythological rulers of ancient China who is said to have taught humans the use of the plough, is the reputed author of one of the first texts documenting the uses and benefits of herbs. The 16th-century naturalist and acupuncturist Li Shizhen categorised more than a thousand.

At a public herb garden in Shanghai, there is a statue of Li . “Some people may be familiar with Chinese medicinal herbs, but they don’t know their uses,” says a 71-year-old woman, sitting on a bench outside the garden with her granddaughter and her friend. “Older people like us know about it.”

Some people may be familiar with Chinese medicinal herbs, but they don’t know their uses. Older people like us know about it

Mugwort, she explains, can be dried in the sun; dandelions reduce inflammation; leeks are also a form of medicine. “People of my generation learn from their elders,” she adds. Anyway, when she was growing up in the countryside of the 1950s, she says, how could she and her siblings ever afford to see a western-style doctor?

Chan’s was an interrupted childhood. His father was killed by Japanese soldiers, who had seized Guangzhou in 1938. At the age of eight, with four siblings, he became a farmer himself. By his early teens, he could carry 100 jin, an amount equivalent to roughly 50kg. When the war ended, his mother took him to Hong Kong, where it was “easier to survive”. He stayed on alone, though she eventually moved herself, decades later.

There is one memory of the mainland that stays with him. One of the family’s cows had fallen ill, and he recalled a herb to help in such situations. He used it, and it lived. His father had taught him, in the hills behind the village.

“There were no cameras back then,” he says. “But I still remember his face.”

A garden lost and a garden regained, and still Chan Siun-kuen cannot rest. Twice a week, with his friend Alfred Ho, he goes to the Lung Fu Shan herb garden. The herbs may keep getting stolen, which saddens him, but whoever it was at least saw a certain value in them, he says.

There are fewer herb gardens of this kind now, Ho suspects. He says many of the group’s members are getting old; they have sent a proposal to the government to help further develop the garden, so that they can pursue their mission of promoting Chinese medicine and herbs.

It is not that there is no interest; what seems to be forgotten may in fact be too deeply ingrained. In China, a video that lists by name dozens of herbs recently went viral. “It turns out that the countryside by my hometown is covered in gold,” wrote one online commenter. “In Sichuan we fed them to pigs and cattle,” says another. Nicolette Perry cites a similar sentiment. “You definitely get people saying my grandma used to use this,” she says of items such as the garden’s liquorice root.

At Hong Kong University, Wang, who also is from Guangdong, says that he has used the Lung Fu Shan garden to teach students. His university is installing a new herb garden. But much of the knowledge of herbs is in Chinese society conveyed through “the culture within the family”. They might be used in soups, just as elsewhere a drink might once have contained a tincture.

There are an estimated 10,000 types of plants and animals that can be used as medicinal resources in Chinese society, Wang says, compared with only around 1,000-2,000 that are used in “clinical practice” as medicines. Many of them survive “as a folk medicine in the community” but are “not really recorded as in the Chinese medicine textbooks”.

“The knowledge can be preserved still,” he adds. “[It’s] just not preserved in a very systematic way.”

For Chan, there was no time for school. But the earliest lessons still provided the deepest instruction. If you ask him the name of the plant he fed to his cow, a lifetime ago, he can remember it instantly. It is planted in a garden, shielded by trees, on one of the many paths winding through the Lung Fu Shan Country Park.

Cing sing syu. You need to take the wood of the plant, clean it, chop it very finely, mix it with rice, and then into a congee. And now, no translation is needed, because the language is ancient, and it is in his hands. This is how you hold the cow’s nose, and this is how you push down on its tongue, so that it will not reject the cure, so that it will, against all the odds, survive.

4cea0768c5,Financial Times,Bangladesh’s power vacuum - Financial Times,"The downfall of the most seemingly adamantine autocrats often unfolds with extraordinary speed. So it has been for Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh. She ruled increasingly tyrannically for the past 15 years — and overall for 20 of the past 28 years. On Monday, however, after weeks of student-led protests — and a crackdown by the security forces that led to hundreds of deaths — she fled her residence in a helicopter. She has for now taken refuge in neighbouring India, a friend of her regime. Back home, protesters were filmed revelling in and pillaging the contents of her home, a salutary reminder to autocrats everywhere of what the future may hold.

Her departure from office is to be celebrated. She has overseen an ever more repressive and corrupt system: opposition figures have been jailed; there have been extrajudicial killings; and her Awami League party has steadily blurred the division between ruling party and state. She initially oversaw an economic success story primarily by expanding the country’s garment industry. Gross domestic product grew for some years at 7 per cent. But cronyism, corruption and a lack of jobs have limited the country’s development.

The final straw for her opponents was the reintroduction of quotas reserving government jobs for special groups. These included supposed veterans — and their descendants — of the 1971 civil war in which Bangladesh split from Pakistan. The main beneficiaries were expected to be those loyal to her party. Protests against this spiralled into revolt, if not revolution.

Now comes the hard part. Sheikh Hasina presided over a sham of an election in January leading to a fifth term in office. There now has to be a swift and credible transition to a new democratically elected government. The catalyst for Sheikh Hasina’s overthrow was the decision by the security forces not to fire further on the protesters. The support of the army had long been vital to her rule. On Monday, the army chief, Waker-Uz-Zaman, told the nation the military would hold talks with political parties on forming an interim government. He must go further rapidly and outline a timetable for the army’s formal return to the barracks. Bangladesh has unhappy memories of military rule.

The protesters have backed Muhammad Yunus to advise a transitional government. The 84-year-old has a lustrous global reputation: he won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for pioneering microfinance. He was hated by Sheikh Hasina and sentenced in January to six months in prison. Crucially, he has the backing of the student leaders who led the demonstrations and abhor the Awami League, as well as its rival, the Bangladesh National party, which itself has a record of corruption, cronyism and illiberal rule.

For idealists, there is a chance now to reinvigorate if not reimagine the entire political system by breaking the seesawing grip of both parties, which have run the country since independence. But that requires quite a leap of faith. Among a number of pressing risks is that Yunus becomes a figleaf for the men in khaki.

Bangladesh can ill-afford a period of drift, not least as it faces a growing crisis of unemployment. More immediately, it urgently needs the security forces to restore order. The first night of the post-Sheikh Hasina era was marred by murderous riots, including attacks on temples of the Hindu minority. Too often in the past a switch of government between the Awami League and the BNP has led to a fresh bout of revenge. This cycle has to end. But stability will be only a first step. As has been seen in recent years from Romania to Iraq, the aftermath of autocracy is fraught with peril.","A golden statue of a man stands in front of a crowd of people at night, with a flag in the background and a dark blue sky above.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA1B39E40>,2024-08-06 17:05:27.856000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/529af3e0-0cf1-4d19-915c-b887108c4e03,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.9 ],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/4cea0768c5.png
38fbae4b91,Financial Times,Paul Marshall in advanced talks for Spectator magazine - Financial Times,"Hedge fund tycoon Sir Paul Marshall is in advanced talks to acquire the Spectator magazine, putting him in the lead position to take over the conservative weekly title, according to three people with knowledge of the situation.

Marshall has been among the contenders in the auction for the Spectator and the Telegraph newspaper, which are being sold off by the Abu Dhabi-backed investment group RedBird IMI.

A Spectator deal could be agreed as soon as this month, the people said, although they cautioned that Marshall was not in exclusive talks. Sky News first reported the discussions on Thursday. The offer valued the publication at about £100mn, one of the people said.

Marshall is still in the sale process for the Telegraph but a second person said that it was “unlikely” that he would emerge as the buyer.

This means that the titles might be sold separately after first-round bids were submitted last month. RedBird IMI hopes to sell the Telegraph and the Spectator for at least £600mn in total.

Marshall and RedBird IMI declined to comment.

Marshall is the co-founder of Marshall Wace, which he set up in 1997 with Ian Wace. The firm has grown into one of Europe’s largest hedge funds, with $67bn in assets under management.

Marshall has insisted that his day-to-day focus remains his eponymous firm, but over the past few years he has tried to shape the national conversation through involvement in the media sector.

In 2017, he purchased UnHerd, an online comment site, seeking to challenge the mainstream media with a wider range of views. Marshall has grown frustrated with traditional media, which he believes has become tribalised with little room for diverse views.

Soon after, he became a big investor in GB News alongside the Legatum Group, a Christian faith-driven investor based in Dubai. This investment stemmed from his views that a leftwing bias among the dominant UK broadcasters including the BBC and ITV offers an opportunity for a right-leaning rival.

A self-styled classical liberal, Marshall stood for parliament in Fulham in 1987 on an SDP-Liberal Alliance ticket. He quit the Liberal Democrat party in 2015 over its support of continuing EU membership, and backed Brexit in the referendum the following year.

The Spectator bid is being made through Marshall’s Old Queen Street Ventures media group, previously called UnHerd Ventures. Its leadership team includes editor-in-chief Freddie Sayers.

Brent futures traded around $85.04/bbl, a drop of 1.33% in the last 24 hours. Year to date, Brent prices are up by 7.56%.

What is the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price today?

WTI futures fell by 0.94% to $82.11/bbl, as of 9 a.m. ET.

WTI oil price chart

West Texas Intermediate prices have drifted lower in 2024, but prices are up 11.08% over the past three years.

WTI crude fell to its 52-week low of $67.81 per barrel on Dec. 13, 2023. It reached its 52-week high of $95.52 on Sep. 27, 2023. That’s 14.04% higher than the current futures price.

Brent crude oil price today

Brent futures fell by 1.33% to $85.04/bbl, as of 9 a.m. ET.

Brent crude oil price chart

Brent crude oil is generally subject to the same supply and demand factors that influence WTI crude prices, so the long-term price chart looks extremely similar to the WTI chart.

Brent crude oil prices hit their all-time high of $147.50/bbl during the oil market boom in July 2008. However, WTI futures contract prices dropped to as low as negative $40/bbl on April 20, 2020, driven largely by a lack of U.S. storage options during the COVID-19 pandemic. Brent futures contracts remained well above zero, bottoming at around $25/bbl that day.

Brent crude fell to its 52-week low of $72.48 per barrel on Dec. 13, 2023. It reached its 52-week high of $96.62 on Sep. 27, 2023. That’s 11.99% higher than the current futures price.

What is crude oil?

Crude oil is one of the most important commodities in the world, serving as a key energy source and as a raw material used to produce plastics, chemicals and other products. Nearly all the crude oil imported or produced in the U.S. is refined into petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel fuel and heating oil.

The prices of U.S. WTI crude oil and international Brent crude oil are influenced by several factors that can change the market’s supply and demand balance.

The weather in the U.S. market can drastically alter near-term demand for heating oil and natural gas, sending crude oil prices higher.

Natural disasters and geopolitical conflicts worldwide can disrupt production and create oil supply shortages. The U.S. and global economies experience much higher industrial energy demand during periods of strong economic growth and lower demand during economic downturns. Finally, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries can significantly alter global crude oil supplies by increasing or cutting production.

WTI

WTI crude is a blend of oils extracted from U.S. oilfields in Texas, North Dakota and Louisiana and is delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma.

WTI oil has an American Petroleum Institute gravity of 39.6 degrees, considered “light.” WTI also has a sulfur content of just 0.24%, making it very “sweet.” WTI crude oil is typically the benchmark for U.S. oil prices in the trading world.

Brent crude

Brent crude is a sweet, light blend of oils extracted from the North Sea near Europe.

Brent crude is oil extracted from the Brent, Ekofisk, Forties and Oseberg oil fields. Brent has an API gravity of 38 degrees and a sulfur content of 0.4%, making it slightly heavier and less sweet than WTI. Brent is typically used as a benchmark for international oil markets, such as markets in the Middle East, Europe and Africa.

WTI vs. Brent crude

WTI and Brent crude oil blends are both sweet, light crude oil bends used as benchmarks in financial markets. However, there are five key differences between WTI and Brent:

Extraction: WTI is extracted from U.S. oilfields in Texas, North Dakota and Louisiana, while Brent crude is extracted from the North Sea near Europe.

Composition: WTI is slightly lighter and sweeter than Brent oil.

Geopolitics: WTI prices are more heavily influenced by U.S. politics and policies, while international politics and embargoes have a greater influence on Brent prices.

Exchange: Brent crude futures contracts are primarily traded on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), while WTI futures contracts are primarily traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).

Pricing: WTI and Brent crude oil prices are very highly correlated, but Brent oil has historically traded at a slight pricing premium to WTI.

Brent Crude/WTI spread

The difference between the spot price of Brent crude and WTI crude is called the Brent/WTI spread.

The Brent/WTI spread has historically ranged between $4/bbl and $8/bbl, but it can expand or contract based on factors related to U.S. and international supply and demand conditions. For example, the Brent/WTI spread hit nearly $14/bbl in April 2011 when protests sparked market fears of significant oil supply disruptions in the Middle East.

Crude oil futures prices

One of the most popular ways investors speculate on crude oil and other commodity prices is by trading futures contracts. Futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a standardized amount of an asset at a specific price on a particular future date.

WTI crude futures

The most popular WTI crude oil futures contracts are traded on the NYMEX. Each CL contract represents 1,000 barrels of oil, and the contracts trade Sunday to Friday from 6 p.m. to 5 p.m. U.S. ET.

Brent crude futures

The most popular Brent Crude Oil futures contracts are traded on the ICE under the symbol B, but investors can also trade the contracts on the CME Globex trading platform under the symbol BZ. Trading hours for Brent futures on CME are the same as WTI futures: Sunday to Friday from 6 p.m. to 5 p.m. U.S. ET. But Brent futures on ICE trade from 8 p.m. to 6 p.m. U.S. ET on ICE business days.

BBC News

As the new series of the BBC's Paranormal looks into alleged UFO sightings, one aerospace expert says accessible, modern technology puts us in a stronger position than ever to work out what's going on in the skies above us.

It was a rainy day in Pembrokeshire in February 1977 when a group of pupils from Broad Haven Primary School claimed to see an unidentified flying object (UFO) outside.

David Davies, who was just 10 at the time, remembers his fellow students coming inside throughout the day ""trying to alert the headmaster that there was something strange going on"".

The schoolboy was sure there was a logical explanation for what they had seen. ""My intention was to go out there and completely prove them wrong,"" David says.

But when he went to investigate, he says he saw a ""silver, cigar-shaped object"" about the size of a bus, with a domed upper section and a ""red pulsating glow"" on top.

""I had this overwhelming urge to run away,"" David says of the sighting that lasted about 10 seconds.

This event in south-west Wales is explored in the latest series of the BBC's Paranormal. Across four episodes, host Sian Eleri investigates alleged UFO sightings in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

It comes as claims about extraterrestrial life have captured the public imagination yet again. Last year, the US Congress convened a landmark panel on the topic, mysterious monoliths continue to appear in the UK and around the world, and social media is home to viral trends about ""alien bodies"". On TikTok, for example, there are more than a million posts with the hashtag ""UFO"".

And one aerospace expert tells the BBC that in 2024, thanks to everyone having a phone in their pocket and many people using apps to follow air traffic, we are in ""a much stronger position to be able to track what's known and what's unknown"".

So is there a simple explanation for why we see UFOs? And should they be investigated?

'A lot of UFO hunting'

UFOs have held our attention for decades, ever since reports of alleged extraterrestrial debris in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947, the movie The Flying Saucer being released three years later and the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union gaining steam throughout 1950s.

And stories about alien life would go on to influence popular culture in the years to come, from Steven Spielberg's Oscar-winning E.T. in 1982, to The X Files first airing in 1993 and even recent additions like Jordan Peele's 2022 film Nope feeding into the cultural obsession.

Dr Ciaran O'Keeffe - the head of the school of human and social sciences at Buckinghamshire New University - says there was also a ""huge peak of interest"" in UFO sightings around the 1980s that resulted in ""a lot of UFO hunting"".

Reported sightings were covered by media around the world - and the alleged sighting at Broad Haven Primary School was picked up by publications as far as New Zealand.

The Broad Haven incident was one of a wave of sightings in the area in 1977 - dubbed the Dyfed Triangle. In the past, a number of theories have been put forward to explain them, including the work of a ""local prankster"".

While sightings like the one in Broad Haven captured mass attention, Dr O'Keeffe says there may be plausible explanations.

""The key fundamental psychological explanation for what's going on is around eyewitness testimony,"" says Dr O'Keeffe, who also consults on the BBC's Uncanny, adding that eyewitness testimony can be prone to errors.

""The nature of the interviewing of an eyewitness can distort the memory of the event significantly,"" he adds, especially if the questioning of a witness is poor. For example, leading questions and exposure to media coverage of an event can be distorting factors.

However, the UFO sighting at Broad Haven Primary School was not just one eyewitness, it was a group of pupils. Here, Dr O'Keeffe explains the idea of ""contagion"" and group conformity could be behind a mass UFO sighting.

""Contagion is this idea that thoughts, feelings and behaviours can spread amongst a group of people,"" Dr O'Keeffe says.

However, David feels he can ""rule out"" these psychological explanations for the 1977 sighting after the children reportedly drew near identical images of the UFO they had seen.

Before the incident, David adds, he did not have a ""big interest in Sci-Fi"". But in the years that followed, he would spend thousands of pounds on books and research materials to understand what happened.

'Not always publicised'

Dr Ryan Marks, an aerospace engineer who appears in Paranormal, says air traffic in the sky could also offer plausible explanations for UFO sightings, particularly around built-up areas where there are airfields.

According to the RAF Museum, between 1970 and 1990 there were five airfields in south Wales, with one being used as a missile testing range.

""There's a huge amount of air traffic at any one time and that's obviously increased over the last 40 years,"" Dr Marks explains, adding that there is ""always a level of military activity"" in the sky and that ""not all of this is always publicised"".

In March this year, for example, a US government report concluded that UFO sightings in the US in the 1950s and 1960s were caused by tests of advanced spy planes and space technology.

Around the mid-1970s to early 1980s, Dr Marks says developments were taking place in the UK exploring hot air balloons and airships - and some ""would resemble traditional UFOs"".

He notes, however, these were ""small-scale"" experiments that did not get outside of the air hangar.

Today, Dr Marks says, ""a lot of air traffic movements are recorded,"" with free-to-download apps able to identify a plane, where it has come from and its destination. This ""digital fingerprint"" makes it a lot easier to track what is going on in the sky, he explains.

For his part, David remains confident in his UFO sighting.

""Unless somebody can explain to me what type of aircraft was flying at that time, that was 45-feet long, cigar-shaped and silver - I have no explanation for it,"" he says, adding that believing in UFOs can sometimes be ""like you're banging your head against a brick wall, against society"".

""It's still being dismissed as nonsense,"" he says.

The Ministry of Defence (MOD) closed their UFO desk in 2009 after saying it served no defence purpose and was taking staff away from more valuable defence-related activities.

In a statement, an MOD spokesperson added: ""In over 50 years, no sightings of extraterrestrial intelligence, Unidentified Flying Objects and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena reported to us indicated the existence of any military threat to the United Kingdom.""","A woman stands on a cliff edge overlooking the sea, with a stormy sky in the background.

3d02629465,Financial Times,Donald Trump taps Texas oil tycoons in bid to close cash gap with Joe Biden - Financial Times,"Donald Trump swept through Texas on Wednesday seeking to bolster his campaign war chest with donations from oil barons and moguls controlling vast fortunes spanning sectors from sports to automotive.

The former president, whose in-person campaigning has been restricted by his “hush money” criminal trial in New York, attended lunchtime fundraisers in Houston before dashing to a dinner in Dallas.

One Houston event was hosted by shale oil tycoon Harold Hamm, chair of Continental Resources, alongside Occidental Petroleum chief Vicki Hollub and Energy Transfer chair Kelcy Warren. Jeff Hildebrand of Hilcorp, another oil company, and George Bishop of GeoSouthern Energy were among the hosts of another meeting.

Trump has sought to shore up support among deep-pocketed executives in the US’s fossil fuel sector with a pledge to rip up much of President Joe Biden’s environmental and climate agenda and allow the industry to “drill, baby, drill”.

“President Trump is supported by people who share his vision of American energy dominance to protect our national security and bring down the cost of living for all Americans,” Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to the Financial Times.

The fundraising drive targeting Texas’s wealthy donors comes as Trump seeks to catch Biden in a race to build a cash pile for what is expected to be the most expensive White House contest ever. Biden has $70mn more on hand than Trump, according to an FT analysis of the latest campaign finance data.

Trump is also set to visit California next month for a series of fundraisers hosted by billionaire tech entrepreneur Palmer Luckey and venture capitalist David Sacks, among others.

At Houston’s five-star Post Oak hotel, owned by Houston Rockets owner and Trump supporter Tilman Fertitta, attendees on Wednesday were shuttled into a room decked out with blue drapes and US flags for lunch, photo ops and a roundtable with the former president. Outside, a tight security detail of staffers, Houston police officers and secret service turned away those who had not paid the $10,000 minimum cost of admittance.

Energy Transfer’s Warren declined to comment. None of the other oil executives in attendance responded to requests for comment.

Despite the strong turnout in Houston, many oil executives have been privately sceptical of Trump, whose volatility and vows to ratchet up tariffs could undercut oil demand.

Hamm had initially pushed for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and later gave money to Nikki Haley, while Hildebrand donated to North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum and former vice-president Mike Pence.

But leading oil executives offer a rich vein for Trump’s fundraisers, with many flush with cash after their companies racked up record profits in the past three years.

“He’ll raise money here, for sure. Now, will it be as much as last time? I would be surprised if it was,” said one wealthy Texas oil donor who has donated to the Republican party in the past but has described himself as a “never-Trumper”.

Wednesday’s trip was Trump’s second to Texas in less than a week, after he addressed the National Rifle Association in Dallas on Saturday. He praised Texas and also accused Biden of creating the “weakest border in history” — a hot-button topic in the state.

“Donald Trump is in Texas for one reason: so his oil and gas buddies cut him checks, because they know he’ll cut their taxes,” said Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa.

Despite Biden’s overall cash advantage, Trump raised more than him in April, according to figures from the two campaigns.

The Hildebrand event on Tuesday raised funds for causes including the Trump campaign and a group that pays the ex-president’s legal bills, and was co-hosted by Fertitta, helicopter baron Al Gonsoulin, hospitality chief Emerson Hankamer and auto magnate John McGill.

The host committee gave $250,000 or raised $500,000 per couple and attendees gave at least $10,000 per person, according to the invitation.

The lunch hosted by Hamm, Hollub and Warren raised money for Make America Great Again Inc — a pro-Trump super Pac that has given more than $57mn to Save America, the primary group paying Trump’s lawyers.

d318b27c73,Newsmax,Trump Unveils Vow to End Federal Income Tax on Tips - Newsmax,"Making an appeal to blue-collar service industry workers in Las Vegas, Nevada, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump announced a new campaign vow to end federal taxes on tip-related income.

""So this is the first time I've said this — and for those hotel workers and people that get tips, you're going to be very happy — because when I get to office, we are going to not charge taxes on tips, people making tips: We're not going to do it,"" Trump told his Las Vegas campaign rally Sunday that aired live and in its entirety on Newsmax and the Newsmax2 streaming platform.

""And we're going to do that right away, first thing in office, because it's been a point of contention for years and years and years.""

Nevada is not only a key battleground state for the 2024 presidential election, but it is a state with a large voting and working-class base that relies on tip-related income. It also is a big union state for hospitality workers, and Trump's campaign vow makes an appeal for their votes against President Joe Biden.

""You do a great job of service,"" Trump continued. ""You take care of people, and I think it's care of people, and I think it's going to be something that really is deserved.""

Tips are largely earned income for those in the service industry who put in extra effort and Trump wants them to be rewarded.

""More importantly, popular or unpopular — I do some unpopular things, too; if it's right for the country, I do what's right — but so those people that have jobs in restaurants, whatever the job may be, a tipping job, we're not going after for taxes anymore,"" Trump said.

""I announce that for the first time, first time I've brought it up. First time anyone's brought it up, I think. It's never been brought up before.

""And I also think it's very appropriate.""

Trump has been battling Biden and the historic core of the Democrat voting base, contending for the union workers vote. It can potentially help him get over the top in a closely contested state like Nevada, which was one of the handful of states that decided the 2020 presidential election.

""If we win Nevada, we win the whole thing,"" Trump said, cutting his usual lengthy campaign rally speech to an hour due to the 100-degree desert heat and a malfunctioning teleprompter.

Off-prompter, Trump was his usual self.

""And by the way, isn't that breeze nice? Do you feel the breeze? Because I don't want anybody going on me,"" Trump said, wishing his rallygoers to avoid dying at his rally.

""We need every voter. I don't care about you. I just want your vote,"" he said, trolling his ""fake news media"" critics and anti-Trump opposition. ""I don't care.

""See, now, the press will take that and they'll say, 'he said a horrible thing.'""

d67cdeb9e7,The Guardian,Three Labour names in frame with Diane Abbott’s candidacy in doubt - The Guardian,"Labour could select one of three “credible” candidates to run in Diane Abbott’s seat as it seemed intent on not allowing Abbott to stand for the party despite an investigation into her conduct being completed six months ago.

Abbott, Britain’s first black female MP, was suspended from the party in April last year over a letter in the Observer suggesting Jewish people were not subject to racism “all their lives”, meaning she was still an independent when parliament was prorogued for the general election on 4 July.

Labour’s national executive committee completed its investigation in December, it has emerged, and Abbott was given a formal warning with an instruction to complete an online antisemitism training course in February.

It was reported on Tuesday evening that Labour had restored the whip to Abbott, but it remained unlikely that she would be selected as a candidate in the upcoming election.

The Guardian understands that the party could make a renewed push to exclude her from standing again for her Hackney North and Stoke Newington seat after she liked a post on X by Jeremy Corbyn’s wife, Laura Alvarez, about his decision to stand as an independent candidate. Restoring the whip to Abbot would allow her to leave the party “with dignity”, according to party sources.

In the past, Labour has blocked a number of leftwing hopefuls from standing as candidates and suspended party members for expressing support for other political parties.

Although her fate is officially yet to be decided, three Labour activists with links to Abbott’s constituency – Anntoinette Bramble, the deputy mayor of Hackney council; Sem Moema, the London assembly member for North East; and Mete Coban, a Labour councillor for Stoke Newington – have been widely talked about as possible replacements.

Abbott was suspended after she wrote a letter, for which she has apologised, suggesting Jewish, Irish and Traveller people were not subject to racism “all their lives”.

Party sources acknowledge the huge amount of support that Abbott has locally and had been hoping to find a civil agreement and not stand for Labour at the next election due to what are termed as health difficulties.

But sources close to Abbott have questioned why her future in the party has been linked to her health, and why she cannot make the decision.

BBC Newsnight was first to report that the NEC had completed its investigation as long ago as December. In March, Abbott strongly denied reports that had she rejected antisemitism training offered by the party.

Labour figures from across different factions of the party are understood to be furious that the case was concluded so long ago but shadow ministers have continued to present it as ongoing, seemingly not knowing. Others have expressed concern that black Labour members will feel there is no space for them in the party if she is ejected.

After the Guardian revealed that the Conservatives’ biggest donor, Frank Hester, had told colleagues that looking at Abbott made you “want to hate all black women” and that the MP “should be shot”, Abbott said she hoped to receive some “public support” from the Labour leader, Keir Starmer.

In the wake of the row, Starmer criticised Hester’s “abhorrent language” but told the BBC that Abbott’s suspension “was for an entirely different issue”.

When asked about Abbott’s case last week, Starmer said: “The final decisions on candidates is coming up in a few days’ time, I think 4 June – it may be a little earlier, a little later, I can’t quite remember. But within a relatively short period of time the final list of candidates will be decided, and that will be a matter for the Labour party’s national executive committee.”

A spokesperson for the leftwing campaign group Momentum said: “This is outrageous news which confirms that the Starmer leadership is trying to force Britain’s first black woman MP out of parliament. For months we have been told by Keir Starmer that the process is independent and it’s nothing to do with him.”","An image of a woman with a blurred face, wearing a red jacket, with a blue 'The Guardian' logo in the corner.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BA3030040>,2024-05-28 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/may/28/three-labour-names-in-frame-diane-abbott-election,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/d67cdeb9e7.png
1e2941e7a2,CNN,Backlash over NFL player Harrison Butker’s commencement speech has reached a new level - CNN,"The NFL is distancing itself from controversial comments by Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker during a recent commencement address. In addition to calling Pride Month a “deadly sin” and bemoaning diversity and equity initiatives, Butker set off waves of criticism when he suggested that women find more fulfillment through getting married and having children than by pursuing careers – directly after quoting a song by Taylor Swift.

The backlash has been building since Butker made the comments Saturday in an address to graduates at Benedictine College, a small Catholic school in Atchison, Kansas.

The NFL issued a statement Wednesday, saying Butker’s comments don’t reflect the views of the league.

“Harrison Butker gave a speech in his personal capacity. His views are not those of the NFL as an organization,” said Senior Vice President Jonathan Beane, the league’s chief diversity and inclusion officer. “The NFL is steadfast in our commitment to inclusion, which only makes our league stronger.”

GLAAD also issued a statement calling Butker’s speech “a clear miss” and “woefully out of step with Americans about Pride, LGBTQ people and women.”

The Chiefs, defending Super Bowl champions and one of the NFL’s marquee teams, have not responded to requests for comment.

However, plenty of women (and Taylor Swift fans) have made their feelings plainly known, including the sisters of Mount St. Scholastica monastery, a founding institution and sponsor of Benedictine College.

“The sisters of Mount St. Scholastica do not believe that Harrison Butker’s comments in his 2024 Benedictine College commencement address represent the Catholic, Benedictine, liberal arts college that our founders envisioned and in which we have been so invested,” they said in a statement. “Instead of promoting unity in our church, our nation, and the world, his comments seem to have fostered division.”

Such pushback could keep Butker’s social media feeds clogged with criticism for the foreseeable future. It also could be an optical problem for the NFL and the Chiefs, who have both enjoyed increased support from female fans in the past year.

What Butker said about women — and Taylor Swift

In front of the crowd of about 485 male and female graduates, Butker suggested that a woman’s accomplishments in the home are more valuable than any academic or professional goals.

“I want to speak directly to you briefly because I think it is you, the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told to you,” he said.

“How many of you are sitting here now about to cross this stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world.”

Butker also praised his wife Isabelle, saying she “would be the first to say her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother.”

Judging from the hundreds upon hundreds of critical comments on Butker’s Instagram posts and about him on X and TikTok, his remarks did not sit well with many people.

“This wasn’t a case of foot-in-mouth. It was a well-prepared speech,” wrote columnist Sam McDowell in the Kansas City Star. “Women listening in the audience, rather than being rewarded with a diploma on graduation day, were made to listen as he promoted the role of homemaker — not as an acceptable choice, but as their duty as a husband’s servant.”

It also didn’t sit well with many people that Butker invoked Swift, the pop star who is dating Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce and who was a frequent sight at Chiefs games this past season, including the Super Bowl.

Butker likely became the first person in history to quote a Taylor Swift song while criticizing Catholic priests for catering too much to the feelings of their parishioners. “As my teammate’s girlfriend says: ‘Familiarity breeds contempt,’” Butker said at one point, quoting Swift’s song “Bejeweled” (and, by extension, a common turn of phrase).

Conservative voices have praised Butker’s speech for being “100% correct” and for reflecting his self-professed deep Catholic faith. However, his reference to Swift — a childless, unmarried superstar and feminist figure who by Butker’s own definition is not living up to her potential — has prompted additional outcry.

Feminists and Taylor Swift fans have fired back

Butker, 28, has been with the Chiefs for seven seasons. He kicked four field goals as the Chiefs edged the San Francisco 49ers, 25-22, in February to win the Super Bowl.

Before his speech, Butker’s Instagram account was rather innocuous: Mostly photos of his gameday outfits paired with Bible quotes, posed shots next to conservative figures and bits of Christian wisdom, all met with generally hospitable commentary from fans.

Now, nearly every recent post on his account has been overrun with insults, some questioning how Butker feels about women like Swift, who have found success outside of marriage and motherhood:

“I feel bad for those poor women who looked forward to their graduation and had you inflicted upon them.”

“Have a talk with Travis about how you can be successful, masculine AND still incredibly supportive of your girlfriend’s career.”

The deluge of criticism reached almost every corner of social media, and people took notice.

“As a woman, does watching Harrison Butker get cooked online count as being in the kitchen,” reads one popular post on X.

“I’ll let the Swifties handle Harrison Butker,” reads another.

Commenters and social influencers also picked up on another piece of information that appears at odds with Butker’s worldview. His mother, Elizabeth Keller Butker, is a medical physicist at Emory University’s Winship Cancer Institute in Atlanta and holds, among other academic accolades, a degree in chemistry from Smith College, a private women’s liberal arts college in Massachusetts.

“What does your mom think about your little speech, Harrison?” asked Vicki Chan, a doctor and TikTok creator with more than 500,000 followers.

CNN has reached out to Benedictine College, where Butker gave his address, and is awaiting a response.

The backlash comes as the NFL is trying to court female fans

While the fallout from Butker’s address is messy enough already, there’s another complicating detail to consider.

The NFL has tried to woo female fans for years. When Swift began appearing at Chiefs games last fall to support her boyfriend Kelce, female interest in the NFL skyrocketed. Super Bowl LVIII, in which the Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers and the superstar couple shared picture-perfect embraces after the victory, was the most-watched Super Bowl ever. Even NFL commissioner Roger Goodell acknowledged the “Taylor Swift effect” on the season.

To many, Butker’s comments are a kick in the face to a burgeoning, and valuable, demographic of NFL fans.

“Hey NFL. If you want to continue to grow your female fan base and any other marginalized group (straight white men are already watching your product), come get your boy,” tweeted former “Monday Night Football” reporter Lisa Guerrero.

Some commenters also asked the Chiefs to issue a response to Butker’s remarks in the interest of their female fans. So far, the Chiefs have not made a public comment.

While Butker’s remarks about women and Taylor Swift inspired a very specific sort of backlash, critics had plenty to say about the other parts of his speech, too. A few details in particular have stirred up discontent:

• Butker criticized President Joe Biden, who is Catholic, and other unnamed Catholic leaders for “pushing dangerous gender ideologies onto the youth of America” — an apparent reference to transgender rights.

• In a swipe at LGBTQ communities, Butker encouraged graduates to have Catholic pride, but “not the deadly sin sort of pride that has an entire month dedicated to it.”

• Butker also waded into the DEI debate, saying, “The world around us says that we should keep our beliefs to ourselves whenever they go against the tyranny of diversity, equity and inclusion.”

In response to his comments about diversity, Tennessean reporter Andrea Williams pointed out Butker shares the field with Patrick Mahomes, who is considered one of the best players of his generation and is one of only a handful of Black quarterbacks to win a Super Bowl.

“Harrison Butker doesn’t have three Super Bowl rings without Patrick Mahomes,” she wrote. “And without those Super Bowl rings, he doesn’t have the aforementioned praise or platform.”

Some women also pointed out that Butker’s understanding of Catholicism — and what the faith asks of its adherents — is far from universal.

Journalist Yvette Walker wrote a faith-based critique for the Kansas City Star, noting the many women of the Bible who contributed to their communities outside of traditional gender roles.

“I hope the women in the audience who didn’t agree with everything Butker said remember that they can think for themselves, read the Bible for themselves, and choose the reasoning God granted to live a full and worthwhile life whether you have a family or not,” she wrote.

51d48114cf,Financial Times,French voters juggle democratic duty and summer getaways - Financial Times,"President Emmanuel Macron’s snap election gambit has caught everyone by surprise, not least French holidaymakers rushing to sign up for proxy voting in order to save their summer plans.

At a police station in Paris’s 11th arrondissement earlier this week, a steady stream of citizens were registering their friends and family members to cast ballots in their place so they could still escape the city on June 30 and July 7 — the two consecutive Sundays when the parliamentary vote takes place.

“I’m privileged to have a place to go to outside Paris,” said Thierry Vila, a 76-year-old novelist who is sticking to his plan to go to his second home in Toulon for a writing retreat. “But there is a political imperative for me to vote,” he said, adding that he was determined to oppose the far right from coming to power.

The run-off vote will be the first legislative election to be held in July since France’s Fifth Republic began in 1958, and comes a day after the start of the country’s school holidays.

French citizens who live abroad can vote online but there will be no postal vote in these elections because of the shortness of the campaign.

According to France’s interior ministry, which oversees elections, more than 700,000 people registered for a proxy vote in just over a week after Macron’s shock announcement — more than six times the number of people requesting this form of voting over a similar period in 2022, when elections were held in mid June.

“There could be a record number of proxy votes,” said Anne Muxel, deputy director of Cevipof, a think-tank at Sciences Po.

Although some can go through the process entirely online, most voters “have to go to a police station or the town hall to verify their identity so they need to be motivated”, Muxel added. “I don’t think many will cancel their holidays to vote.”

So-called juilletistes, French people who take their holidays in July instead of the more common period in August, face difficult choices when designating their proxy: choosing someone they can trust and who is not also on holiday.

Valentine, a charity worker and leftwing voter, said she found a friend to vote on her behalf — as she was sticking to her Alpine holiday plans for both election Sundays. She said the process had been “simple” though her proxy will have to travel across Paris to get to Valentine’s designated voting station.

To meet the growing demand, parties offer online services to match voters with like-minded potential proxies. Among their users is Philippe, a software engineer based in La Réunion, one of France’s overseas territories, who is relocating to the mainland but has been unable to change his voting residency.

“My friends in La Réunion are people I adore but I can’t particularly trust to do a proxy vote because they don’t have the same political convictions as me,” he said.

In an attempt to galvanise the youth vote, French football star Kylian Mbappé — who risks being in Germany at the time of both rounds if his team performs well at the Euro 2024 championship — told his fans to carry out their democratic duty and warned “the extremes are at the doors of power”.

Turnout will be key because of the format of the two-round election: the top two vote winners qualify, but if another candidate also clears the bar of 12.5 per cent of registered voters they advance, too.

The high stakes of the election should also raise turnout, which was 52 per cent for the recent European parliament elections.

If the participation rate is high, it lowers the percentage of voters that a party needs to qualify. For Macron’s centrist alliance, which is running third place in polls, the participation rate will help determine their fate.

But those not on electoral lists for the European elections at the start of the month will not be able to register on time, a factor that could hit support for both the leftwing Nouveau Front Populaire (NFP) and Marine Le Pen’s far-right Rassemblement National party.

“We know that in general, the highest abstention rates are among the working class and young people,” said Antoine Bristielle, a director at the Jean Jaurès Foundation, significant voters for the far right and the left’s NFP.

“The key for the parties will be mobilising these electorates,” he added.","An image of a beach with people sunbathing and swimming, surrounded by palm trees and a clear blue sky.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BCAC85780>,2024-06-21 04:00:32.717000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/d55b5d80-b1ee-4b68-8946-92a973c54c15,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/51d48114cf.png
21a9132952,Newsmax,Trump: Biden's Illegal Immigrants Targeting Americans - Newsmax,"Former President Donald Trump, lambasting President Joe Biden Saturday night on Biden's border policies, accused him of ""releasing illegal criminals into our communities to rape, pillage, plunder, and to kill"" Americans.

""Just this week, a 12-year-old girl in Houston, Jocelyn Nungaray, was tied up, stripped, and strangled to death after walking to a 7-Eleven,"" Trump said in an address that aired live on Newsmax and simulcast on the Newsmax2 online streaming platform.

""Charged with Jocelyn's heinous murder are two illegal alien savages that Joe Biden recently set loose into our country. They came across our border claiming they feared for their lives in Venezuela.""

Trump, further speaking out about several other victims of crimes, promised the families, including relatives of Rachel Morin, a mother of five who was slain, allegedly by an immigrant who was in the United States illegally.

""But you know it's going to happen again because we have an incompetent man,"" said Trump. ""He's an incompetent and he happens to be the president. You know, all he has to do is say, Close the border. He doesn't need Congress.""

Trump promised that if elected, he will return to the policies he endorsed while president.

""We will shut down deadly sanctuary cities,"" he said. ""I will shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement. And on day one, we will begin the largest domestic deportation operation in American history. We have no choice.""

Under Biden, he added, ""We're like a dumping ground for the rest of the world,"" and once he came to office, ""there was an explosion of illegal immigration"" as well as drugs and human trafficking.

""You know what made it almost as big as the drug dealing stuff? It was the internet,"" Trump said.

""It's made massive human trafficking in women, and there's more of it going on right now than anytime in the history of the world. And it's taken place during this horrible, pathetic president's time in office.""

38202b4b04,New York Post,"Richard Dreyfuss’ son reacts to his alleged sexist, homophobic rant at ‘Jaws’ screening - New York Post","Richard Dreyfuss upset a lot of people with his alleged sexist and homophobic rant — and now his son is weighing in.

The 76-year-old actor participated in a “Jaws” screening at a Massachusetts movie theater on Saturday and reportedly went on a rogue rant that caused attendees to walk out.

Dreyfuss allegedly went off about topics like Barbra Streisand, transgender youth and gender affirmation, and the Academy Awards’ inclusivity rules.

His son, Ben Dreyfuss, 37, reacted to the controversy the following day on X, formerly known as Twitter.

“Re: my father: well, now you know why I refused to give him the password to his own twitter account for a decade lol,” he wrote.

“This will be my only statement on the matter. thank you.”

He later added: “My dad and I disagree about lots of stuff. But it’s a free country. People are allowed to have different opinions about stuff.”

Ben also shared a screenshot of an article about his father’s controversial remarks that popped up on his “For You” page.

“God, what sort of algorithmic sorcery is this?” Ben tweeted.

He continued: “They should add a little bit of code to algorithms that is like ‘bad or critical news about your nuclear family members we’re actually not going to show you because it’s probably the last thing you want to read.’ “

Ben is the middle child of Dreyfuss’ three kids with ex-wife Jeramie Rain. The exes also share daughter Emily, 40, and son Harry, 33.

Dreyfuss has yet to speak out about the offensive comments he made at the event called “An Evening With Richard Dreyfuss + Jaws Screening” in Beverly, Massachusetts. In Steven Spielberg’s 1975 classic suspense flick, Dreyfuss plays Hooper, who shares his shark knowledge with Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) and Captain Quint (Robert Shaw) as they attempt to catch the oceanic predator gobbling up summer beachgoers.

Many of the Cabot theater attendees revealed on social media that they left the event out of disgust over Dreyfuss’ comments.

“We walked out of his interview tonight along with hundreds of others because of his racist homophobic misogynistic rant,” one person wrote on Facebook.

The Cabot theater sent out an apology email and expressed their regret in a statement obtained by the Hollywood Reporter.

“We are aware of, and share serious concerns, following the recent event with Richard Dreyfuss prior to a screening of the film ‘Jaws’ at The Cabot. The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold as an organization. We deeply regret the distress that this has caused to many of our patrons,” a representative wrote.

“We regret that an event that was meant to be a conversation to celebrate an iconic movie instead became a platform for political views. We take full responsibility for the oversight in not anticipating the direction of the conversation and for the discomfort it caused to many patrons.”

“We are in active dialogue with our patrons about their experience and are committed to learning from this event how to better enact our mission of entertaining, educating and inspiring our community.”

The Post has reached out to representatives for Dreyfuss for comment.","A man in a white shirt is embracing another man in a black suit, with a blurred face, in a room with a green wall and a ceiling with lights.

0aadfb10ff,National Review,The Biden-Harris Mental Gymnastics - National Review,"The Paris Olympics began on July 26, and Democrats were ready. They’ve been performing mental gymnastics for the last month.

The party and its media allies deserve medals in political contortion. In the space of a few weeks, they’ve gone from saying that Joe Biden is the next FDR, to Biden is fine, how dare you question his age, to Biden is incapable of serving a second term, to Biden is a stubborn old man who will sink the party, to Biden is a demigod whose selflessness will be recalled for centuries.

Keeping up with the changing party line is exhausting. Not long ago, remember, it was considered a slur to suggest that Joe Biden was too old and infirm to be reelected president.

In June, when the Wall Street Journal published a detailed report on Biden’s memory loss and confusion, the White House denounced the paper and its parent company. Biden’s BFFs on MSNBC called the article “a Trump hit piece.”

Days later, when videos circulated on social media of a stiff and vacant Biden visiting Normandy for the 80th anniversary of D-Day, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the images were “cheap fakes” made “in bad faith.” The Washington Post published a story headlined “How Republicans Used Misleading Videos to Attack Biden in a 24-Hour Period.” Misleading, indeed.

Then, on June 27, Biden debated Donald Trump. He gave the worst debate performance in American history. His condition was broadcast to the world. Trump’s polling lead grew. And the message changed.

Democrats said that Biden would have to prove his viability. He couldn’t. A follow-up interview with George Stephanopoulos went badly. A “big boy” press conference was cringe-inducing.

Calls for Biden to withdraw grew louder. Some came from the very people who had denounced questions about Biden’s mental and physical capacities as partisan and ageist and ableist. “I hope he’ll do the right thing and step aside,” wrote New York Times columnist Paul Krugman. One New Yorker encountered Stephanopoulos on the street and recorded their brief conversation. The passerby asked about Biden. “I don’t think he can serve four more years,” Stephanopoulos said. Thank you, Captain Obvious.

Civil war broke out in the Democratic Party. The Congressional Black Caucus and the socialist “Squad” backed Biden; swing-state congressmen and senators called for him to make room for another nominee. Fundraising dried up. Nancy Pelosi worked against him behind the scenes. “Former president Barack Obama has told allies in recent days that President Biden’s path to victory has greatly diminished and he thinks the president needs to seriously consider the viability of his candidacy,” reported the Post on July 18. Three days later, Biden said that he would not accept the Democratic nomination. In a separate post, he endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris.

The spin did not stop. Between the debate and Biden’s announcement, the president had been treated as a figure worthy of scrutiny, even contempt. Late-night comics, the Democratic Party’s court jesters, mocked him. George Clooney, in the op-ed heard ’round the world, disclosed that Biden’s frailty was real and unignorable and well known among high-level donors. Democrats preemptively had blamed Biden for losing to Trump in November and bringing congressional candidates down with him.

The anger, frustration, harsh words, and critical thinking ceased as soon as Biden said he was out. Suddenly the same man who had divided the Democrats bitterly, who had brought the party to the brink of defeat, who had delayed his exit until 107 days before the election, was treated as a hero and a legend. “History will honor him,” posted Democratic strategist David Axelrod, who had pushed for over a year for Biden to retire. “President Biden, you have stepped into Washington’s shoes,” wrote one college professor in The Hill. The New York Times editorial board said that Biden “has placed the national interest above his own pride and ambition.” It would be more accurate to say that Biden placed the Democratic interest above his own pride and ambition — and only when he had no other option.

Most floor routines last 90 seconds. The Democrats’ wolf turns and aerial cartwheels will last through November. Harris was a political liability for Biden and his party. Her vice presidency has had no major accomplishments. Her approval rating starts off lower than Trump’s. Harris last faced serious opposition in 2010, when she barely won the race for state attorney general in navy-blue California. Her 2020 presidential campaign collapsed before Iowa. She has no political base, no signature issue, is not part of a movement, and is best known for her word salads and very online fans.

These inconvenient details have been ignored or forgotten. Instead, an orgy of excitement has accompanied Harris’s rise. With the efficiency of a Malenkov, she locked up the presumptive nomination within 48 hours of Biden’s departure. Her ability to read off a teleprompter with an expression other than befuddlement has been rapturously received by her grateful party. Young and impressionable pundits speak of an “Obama moment,” seemingly unaware that Barack Obama emerged as a star at the Democratic National Convention in 2004 and became, with the publication of The Audacity of Hope in 2006, a cultural phenomenon. In 2008, Obama filled an NFL stadium for his Greek-column acceptance speech. Harris has coconut-tree memes.

The Democrats and the press may yet make Harris something special, something new. Friendly reporters are doing the grunt work of pretending that Harris had no role in the southern border crisis, revising years-old articles to spread the fiction that she was never called “border czar.” No doubt they will also try to distance Harris from the 20 percent rise in prices during the Biden-Harris administration, from the ongoing wars in Ukraine, Gaza, and the Red Sea, and from the ongoing cover-up of Biden’s infirmity. Perhaps they will succeed.

Harris’s candidacy, after all, has knocked Donald Trump off the front page for the first time in a decade. Her earned-media bounce has restored the presidential race to its pre-debate equilibrium: Trump leads, but it’s close. Can Harris and the Democrats keep up the act? She’s an alternate who finds herself the star of the team. She’s facing a political gold medalist. In this competition, there’s no room for error. And the judges? They can be harsh.","A man and a woman are standing side by side, both smiling and pointing towards the camera, with a backdrop featuring the word 'DEMOCRACY' and a partial view of the American flag.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x131 at 0x7D6BCA5B8C70>,2024-07-27 10:30:06+00:00,https://www.nationalreview.com,https://www.nationalreview.com/2024/07/the-biden-harris-mental-gymnastics/,['Politics' 'Opinion/Editorial'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/0aadfb10ff.png
f7905e9f3e,The Guardian,You be the judge: should I have to tell my husband who I’m voting for in the general election? - The Guardian,"The prosecution: Mandy

Barry is very leftwing and wants to change my views. But I have a right to keep my thoughts to myself

My husband, Barry, has strong political opinions and is very leftwing. He’s always trying to persuade me to change my views, and I don’t like it. I was brought up in a very conservative family – it’s all I knew. I don’t like being told what to think, so I try to vote in secret, which he hates.

Recently, when it came to the mayoral elections in London, he got very wound up because I wouldn’t tell him who I was voting for. The postal-vote slip was in the kitchen and he kept saying: “Have you filled that out yet?” I planned to vote at the last minute, but I wouldn’t tell him who for. He’d say: “Do you want me to fill in your postal vote for you?”, which is actually fraud. I think he was joking, but he was desperate to control my vote.

If I say anything positive about the Conservative party in our house, it triggers Barry. He completely loses it. One time he said: “If you vote Conservative in the next election, I’ll divorce you.” And I think he meant it. Our middle daughter has picked up on the tension and tells me not to tell him who I’m voting for, so as to prevent an argument. Every time something happens in the news or with the NHS, Barry says: “Well, you voted for this party.” We met in 2010, and I don’t remember him being like this at the time. We didn’t speak about politics as much then, but now it’s an issue, as Barry is so passionate.

Whenever I try to say something, he knocks me down because he knows more about politics than me. It was like that with my dad, who was obsessed with politics and a Tory all his life. But I feel apathetic about voting and that it’s a waste of time. I’ve got enough to worry about, and I think that I can’t control politics in this country. I do always vote though. I don’t think the Conservatives have done a good job, and Barry and I actually agree on some things: we both voted to stay in the EU and think doctors are overworked. I kind of want Labour to get in to shut him up. But I don’t think we should discuss politics, as he gets so worked up about it.

The defence: Barry

I have become so angry with this government, and I want to be able discuss it with Mandy

Mandy wouldn’t tell me who she was voting for in the local elections last month, so I thought, “Right, I’ll have to find out.” I know I go on and on about politics, but I grew up in a politically aware household where we talked politics all the time. I think families should have these discussions.

Mandy’s dad, for example, was quite far right and voted for Brexit, but always had an informed response and was very knowledgable and we often discussed our views. But Mandy doesn’t want to tell me anything.

We met in 2010, just before the coalition election, and I remember that she voted for David Cameron. We were in a new relationship then, and I didn’t debate politics with her. But, like many people, I’ve grown angrier in the past few years. Watching things go wrong with the Tories during the pandemic wound me up more than ever. It’s been such a long time since we had a Labour government, so I’m frustrated. Perhaps our views feel more polarising this time around.

We do agree on some things: the NHS, education, private schools. But these days I’m more anti-Tory than pro-Labour, although I voted for Sadiq Khan for London mayor. I always vote Labour. Mandy and I can talk through disagreements, but I could probably be better at listening and not shouting her down.

When Mandy defends the Tories, I always say: “Fourteen years, and look what they’ve done to this country!” I feel we’re all exhausted with how the Conservatives have run the UK. At the local elections Mandy wouldn’t give me an indication of which way she was voting, and it drove me mad. I wasn’t really going to fill in her postal vote for her – that was a joke. And so was the time I said I would divorce her if she voted Tory.

Mandy says she won’t be sharing her voting preferences with me in the upcoming general election, and I guess I will have to deal with that. But I stand by my view that people in close relationships should discuss their political leanings. It’s healthy.

The jury of Guardian readers

Should Barry cut out the politics talk?

Barry may have become overwrought with politics and seems to act in a domineering manner, but surely there’s no harm in sharing with him your decision on who you’re going to vote for? You are married after all!

Peter, 71

Barry needs to get off his political high horse. Yes, it’s healthy to share things, but his idea of sharing is shouting Mandy down. He should try a bit of gentle reverse psychology if he wants her to switch from blue to red.

Veronica, 39

Barry is guilty. It is entirely up to Mandy whether she wants to tell her husband who she’ll be voting for. However, Barry’s frustration at not being able to discuss politics with his wife is understandable. Maybe he should back off, then Mandy might feel happier about opening up.

Katie, 21

Your political views aren’t a private quirk, like your favourite ice-cream flavour, so it’s healthy to be asked to defend them. Your vote has consequences, so should be discussed publicly. However, it sounds like Barry’s tactics are a bit aggressive. Perhaps if he spoke to Mandy more gently, he’d be more likely to start a dialogue.

Simone, 44

I’m of the same political stripe as Barry and also can’t wait to get this useless lot out. Nevertheless, he needs to listen to Mandy, and not – as he admits to doing – “shout her down”. He’s bang to rights right there.

Ernesto, 59

Now you be the judge

In our online poll, tell us: should Barry cut out the politics talk?

3b336788bc,The Guardian,"Campaign catchup: 20 election season awards, and one really weird favourite food - The Guardian","Good afternoon. On the last day of campaigning, it’s time to reflect back on the most notable moments of the last six weeks, for a special awards newsletter which we are calling the Election Editionies. I’m sure it will become a thing.

A small note on our election day plans – there’ll be no Election Edition at 5pm as normal, and instead you’ll get a super, special exit poll edition as soon after 10pm as is humanly possible, with reaction to the likely results and a handy companion guide for how to follow the rest of the night. If you’re planning to go to bed, sign up for First Edition here, where Nimo Omer and I will be rounding up what’s just happened at 7am. And on Friday, you’ll receive your last Election Edition of this cycle (don’t cry) at 5pm. And then we can all get some sleep.

But first, the awards. Read on for the winners, and also Rishi Sunak’s thrilling favourite meal.

What happened today

Turnout | Cabinet minister Mel Stride has said that Labour is headed for “the largest majority any party has ever achieved”, prompting accusations from Labour that the Conservatives are trying to suppress voter turnout.

Rishi Sunak | The prime minister has confided to members of his inner circle that he is fearful of losing his Yorkshire constituency at the general election, the Guardian has been told. Sunak has a majority of more than 27,000.

Endorsements | The Sun has backed Labour, saying that “by dragging his party back to the centre ground of British politics for the first time since Tony Blair was in No10, Sir Keir has won the right to take charge”. The tabloid last backed Labour in 2005.

Analysis: Most irritable politician, worst meme and more election prizes

Least imaginative reworking of the original Star Trek set

ITV’s backdrop to the first debate (above), somehow both lurid and completely anodyne, which in fairness did turn out to be appropriate, and very much made it look like either leader might abruptly be beamed up. Set phasers to stunningly unenlightening!

Least helpful football metaphor

In an election absolutely stuffed with them, this surely belongs to Michael Gove: “I’m a Scotland fan, so you wait until the final whistle. Sometimes it looks as though the odds are against you, but you keep on fighting.” Scotland finished bottom of their group at the Euros, with a goal difference of minus five and one point; their manager Steve Clarke drew “stark criticism for what is perceived as an overly negative approach,” the Guardian reported.

Most unjustly irritable politician

Rishi Sunak. Please direct your weapons-grade tetch at whoever forced you to become prime minister and then call this election!

Most overexcited social media polling announcement

A crowded field, in which various pollsters attempted to drum up the kind of anticipation that is more properly aimed at the Radio 1 chart show in about 1995, mostly through the use of triple flashing red light emojis. But let’s go with YouGov, and “MRP ALERT / YouGov will be releasing our second MRP of the election campaign today at 5pm – set your watches!” on 19 June. Really not a good riposte to the (largely unfair) claim that pollsters think they’re the main characters and love it when they get a spicy set of numbers.

Most unpleasant physical space

All spin rooms anywhere, according to everyone who has ever been in one. A personal highlight of the campaign, though: watching a colleague texting from one of them on TV and then receiving a message reading “I MASSIVELY HATE SPIN ROOMS” a few seconds later.

Least successful meme

The above one put out by the Conservatives showing a roulette wheel and the caption “if you bet on Labour, you can never win”. Did good numbers, to be fair – 1.4m views – but unfortunately also put TORIES and GAMBLING next to each other in people’s mindset at a deeply inopportune moment, and was unceremoniously deleted.

Most dubious “journalist”

Isabel Oakeshott, partner of Nigel Farage predecessor and Reform moneyman Richard Tice, who has fearlessly led the way in reporting that the racist exposed by Channel 4 was actually a paid actor, and the candidates who have now abandoned the party were actually Tory plants. I am using the traditional meaning of “report”, which is “declare without supporting evidence”. Feel free to clock off at 6pm.

Most transparent and risk-free attempt to provide future self with unearned air of prophetic wisdom

Another crowded field, but let’s hand it to James O’Brien, who tweeted on 21 June: “I don’t think the Labour majority is going to be anything like as big as the bulk of polling suggests. There, I’ve said it. Feel better now.” As political commentator John Oxley observed: “Smart thing to say, because if you look right you’ve beaten the herd, and if you are wrong no one will remember. But in absence of an argument it’s just a hunch.”

Most disingenuous email subject line

“Not great”, a message to supporters from Labour HQ said on Sunday, ahead of an email moaning that “our fundraising has not picked up as much as we had hoped at this point”. Missing context: Labour raised £8.6m in the first three weeks of the campaign. The Tories raised £1.2m.

Most overexposed technological advance

Ring doorbells, which mean that owners are now in severe danger of getting a video message from a former prime minister. That said, they do also afford the opportunity to yell “GO HOME” at Theresa May from the comfort of your desk.

Worst representation of local campaign outlook

A fine British leafleting tradition, but the winner this time is the Green party in Hyndburn, which pushed dodgy graphics to their natural conclusion by simply removing any numbers from an image showing them nearly neck and neck with Labour, and citing “our latest local polling”, which turns out to be canvassing returns, a notoriously useless measure of opinion. You may wish to know that Survation’s MRP poll from 15 June has Labour on 53%, the Tories on 28%, and the Greens on 4%.

Most obnoxious question from a member of the public

Goes to Robert Blackstock, who you will remember chucked some template insults at Sunak and Starmer and then asked them if they were “really the best we’ve got”, to wild applause. Obviously the two leaders have fully internalised the “never tell the voters they’re wrong” mantra, and competed only over who could acquiesce most feebly to his characterisation of them as a pair of halfwits.

Most implausibly feigned surprise at the consequences of dancing with the devil

The performance art project that is the series of front pages and editorials from the Daily Mail panicking over the danger to Conservative survival posed by Reform UK, including the article headlined: “Nigel Farage? Be careful what you wish for”. We’re all looking for the guy who did this!

Stakhanovite Tory who deserves a peerage if anyone does

Loyal, dogged, willing to say almost anything in your defence when all your other so-called friends have deserted you: we all need a Mel Stride in our lives, honestly.

Most heinous ad

Hard to compete with the Conservative one aimed explicitly at older people which portrayed Labour as an armed group threatening the lives of your family and conjuring wartime tropes of surrender, really.

Most exciting vision of the future

Goes to Steve Baker, hoping to be re-elected in Wycombe but facing an uphill battle, who said he’d like to spend more time “Skydiving, motorcycling, fast-catamaran sailing” if he loses. Wait, is this code for “defecting to the Lib Dems”?

Word most shorn of meaning by overuse

Supermajority. Does it mean big majority? Massive majority? Majority that grants greater power to the government than a smaller majority? Majority in a cape? Nobody really knows, but “majority larger than is acceptable to the median Reform/Tory switcher’ appears to be the working definition, and that will have to do.

Least magnetic celebrity endorsements

The comfortable winners are Holly Valance, Neighbours alum and Marie Antoinetteish wife of billionaire property developer Nick Candy, and furious SAS hard man Ant Middleton, dropped by Channel 4 for various predictable reasons. Both are backing Reform. The Tories avoided this one by ingeniously not publicising any celebrity endorsements at all.

Most emblematic catchphrase

Keir Starmer: “Ordinary hope”.

Weirdest image that nonetheless seems to capture something of the general vibe

This one.

What’s at stake

Zadie Smith writes today for the Guardian on the appetite for change:

Housing. Education. Healthcare. That’s what people talk about. Young people who have to pack up all their stuff every few months to move from one overpriced fleapit to another. Desperate, frazzled, working-class parents stunned to realise their rich counterparts now think it reasonable to “game the state system for a year or two” so it looks better on their kids’ university applications. People who know people who have died waiting for ambulances. People whose relatives died of Covid while Boris Johnson was partying. People queueing for my own local food bank, whom I recognise, whom I went to school with. Adults moving back into their childhood bedrooms, or out of town, or on to the streets.

As far as I can tell, the people I meet when I’m out and about span the political spectrum from radical leftists to small-C conservatives. But whether they want to burn it all down or try to preserve and improve Britain’s rich cultural and institutional history, not one of them cares to live another month being “governed” (in this context, scare quotes are essential) by this particular group of high-rolling chancers, who do not seem to have a thought in their heads besides their own and their donors’ enrichment …

… I’m afraid the papers aren’t going to swing it for you this time, guys. People have eyes. People have children. People pay rent. People go to the shops. People get sick. People go to work. The damage you have done is everywhere and in plain sight. All you have succeeded in achieving this time round is keeping the environment off the agenda entirely, a truly shameful elision in which both of the main parties have colluded.

But look outside: here comes the sun. The very intense sun.

fc299a8916,Newsweek,Chess Player Caught on Camera Attempting to Poison Rival With Mercury - Newsweek,"A security camera caught the moment a chess player allegedly attempted to poison her rival with mercury—and the clip has gone viral online.

The Russian Chess Federation has suspended Amina Abakarova, a 40-year-old chess pro from Makhachkala in the Russian Republic of Dagestan. She has been detained and faces up to three years in prison if convicted of the charges of attempting to poison her 30-year-old rival, Umayganat Osmanova, Metro reported.

Footage said to show Abakarova pouring the mercury from a thermometer on her rival's board and smearing it with a chess piece has been shared by various media outlets. On X, formerly Twitter, it was posted by user Igor Sushko, who wrote that ""Putin immediately fell in love with Abakarova"" following the events—although there has been no suggestion that Russian President Vladimir Putin is involved in the events that transpired.

At the time of writing, the video on X had been viewed 1.2 million times.

The grainy footage shows Abakarova walking across a room and approaching one of the desks with a chessboard on it. She can be seen brushing a substance onto the board by using one of its chess pieces to distribute it. Once done, she looks around the room before walking away.

Osmanova played in the Dagestan Chess Championship in southern Russia as intended but eventually became ill with ""severe dizziness and nausea,"" Metro reported.

After the incident was reported to the authorities by the tournament judge, the CCTV footage was later reviewed by police.

According to Chess.com, which cited an interview on Russia Today, Osmanova said she felt ""terrible, disgusting, and morally depressed"" when she realized she had been poisoned.

She told the television network, Chess.com reported: ""I still feel bad. In the first minutes, I felt a lack of air and a taste of iron in my mouth. I had to spend about five hours on this board. I don't know what would have happened to me if I hadn't seen it earlier.""

Sazhida Sazhidova, the minister of sport in Dagestan, said in a statement on Telegram that he was shocked by the incident.

He said: ""Like many others, I am perplexed by what happened, and the motives of such an experienced competitor as Amina Abakarova are incomprehensible.

""The actions she took could have led to a most tragic outcome, threatening the lives of everyone who was present, including herself. Now she must answer for what she did by the law.""

Abakarova, who won the North Caucasus Federal District Chess Championship in Pyatigorsk in 2023, said her motive was ""personal hostility"" toward Osmanova, who had recently beaten her in a regional contest, Metro reported.

According to the outlet, she has accused Osmanova of saying rude things about her and her family. Osmanova is pushing for the ""maximum punishment.""","A woman is seen playing chess in a room with multiple chess tables, one of which has a chessboard with a poisoned chess piece.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BA25B7DF0>,2024-08-08 17:04:29+00:00,https://www.newsweek.com,https://www.newsweek.com/chess-player-attempting-poison-rival-caught-camera-1936574,['Sports' 'Politics'],[0.9 0.7],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/fc299a8916.png

What Is an AWS Bootcamp?

AWS bootcamps are short, intensive programs that teach learners cloud computing skills required to build cloud projects and navigate Amazon Web Services, a leading cloud provider.

Depending on the specific project in question, using a cloud computing platform such as AWS requires various skills including web development, data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and data analytics. In an AWS bootcamp, all of the aforementioned skills are examined from a cloud perspective.

After the training, learners are encouraged to take the AWS certification exam based on their bootcamp focus. Earning role-based AWS certifications enables students to showcase their expertise and build credibility as AWS cloud professionals.

Most AWS bootcamps are hosted online, allowing learners across the world to access the cloud and its resources, regardless of their location.

Should You Pursue an Online AWS Bootcamp?

Entry-level IT professionals who aspire to cloud computing roles, such as web developer, data engineer, DevOps engineer, SysOps administrator or cloud operator, are highly encouraged to pursue AWS bootcamps.

Being AWS-certified comes with several perks, including advanced technical skills, better career prospects and higher earning potential.

Many AWS bootcamps are offered online, but knowing if online learning is the best option for you is an entirely different question. Below are some factors to consider before pursuing an online AWS bootcamp.

Credibility

Unlike colleges, online bootcamps are largely unregulated. Thus, it’s your responsibility to determine if your online bootcamp is reputable before enrolling. Some metrics to gauge bootcamp credibility include curriculum content, online reviews and graduate success.

Through thorough research, you can find a bootcamp that is worth investing in. Better yet, look out for university-affiliated AWS bootcamps. Many U.S. colleges partner with reputable bootcamp providers to make tech education more accessible.

Pro Tip

Consider enrolling in a college-affiliated AWS bootcamp as these programs are typically well-vetted.

Learning Format and Flexibility

Online bootcamps typically offer self-paced learning modules, allowing you to fulfill program requirements at your preferred speed. However, this may be counterproductive if you need real-time guidance while studying the course material.

If you’re great at self-regulation and time management, an online AWS bootcamp might work for you. Otherwise, pick an on-site program.

Cost

The cost of AWS bootcamps varies widely, depending on the provider. Many online providers offer free AWS training; however, hidden costs may crop up as you complete the program. We recommend seeking online bootcamps that lay out the entire cost of the program, upfront. You may need to contact support or speak with alumni to get an accurate estimate.

Moreover, you might find online bootcamps to be more cost-effective. With distance learning, you can save on transportation and, sometimes, additional housing expenses, if the physical training site is far from your primary residence.

Career Support

Entry-level tech professionals generally need help navigating the competitive IT job market after training. Therefore, we recommend seeking an online bootcamp that offers career support and internship placement, so you can continue to advance your skills.

Several online bootcamp providers including Clarusway and Fullstack Academy offer career services in addition to AWS training.

Online AWS Bootcamp Credibility

As alternative education pathways, bootcamps are largely unregulated compared to traditional colleges. This has resulted in numerous “academies” on the web that are unable to deliver the quality of training learners need to break into the IT field.

In recent times, however, there have been some minor improvements. Bootcamp providers such as the Turing School of Software & Design and NYC Data Science Academy received accreditation from the Accrediting Council for Continuing Education & Training in 2020 and 2021, respectively. However, these providers may not offer programs that fit your schedule or career goals. If this is the case, we recommend consulting the Council on Integrity in Results Reporting (CIRR) to vet your AWS bootcamp.

CIRR relies on enrollment, graduation and job outcome data to report on bootcamp outcomes. Access to student outcomes can help you understand the success rate of a particular bootcamp and decide whether it’s worth investing in.

Paying for an Online AWS Bootcamp

The cost of an online AWS bootcamp differs depending on the provider and, sometimes, the program length. But one thing we’re certain of is that not everyone can afford the full bootcamp cost, especially when the average bootcamp costs north of $8,000, according to Forbes Advisor research.

If you’re worried that you may not be able to achieve your career goal due to high tuition costs, here are some strategies for paying for your bootcamp:

Consider paying upfront. Several bootcamp providers, such as Clarusway, offer significant discounts on upfront payments. Instead of the standard $13,800 fee, applicants are encouraged to pay upfront and save $5,850.

Ask for a payment plan. While paying upfront can save you a lot of money, the discounted fee might still be beyond your budget. If this is the case, ask if the bootcamp provider can offer you a payment plan. This way, you can start the training and pay in installments until you graduate.

Apply for a scholarship. Many bootcamp providers and organizations offer scholarships to eligible applicants. Finding a provider that offers financial aid or scholarships, however, may require a bit of research.

Take out a loan. Bootcamp expenses are not covered by Federal Student Aid, so you need to consider private loans. Several companies help future IT professionals secure funding for their training but you must vet the lender’s terms thoroughly to ensure repaying the loan doesn’t ruin your credit score.

Income share agreement (ISA). ISAs involve pledging a percentage of your income in repayment of the accrued tuition debt. The amount you set aside each month depends on the contract terms, but we only recommend this strategy as a last resort because future conditions are uncertain.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Online AWS Bootcamps

How does AWS work?

AWS comprises a collection of cloud-based services that can act as building blocks for cloud computing. Users can leverage AWS for computing, file storage, database maintenance, servers—essentially anything they need is available to “rent” through AWS.

What does AWS do?

AWS lets computing professionals deploy their products in the cloud to make them accessible to customers on a large scale.

Is an AWS bootcamp worth it?

96185b0f63,National Review,Depicting North Korea - National Review,"Editor’s Note: The below is an expanded version of a piece that appears in the current issue of National Review.

Oslo

Some art exhibitions are unusual — but this one is especially so: in its art, yes, but also in the sounds coming from loudspeakers in the venue. We hear a man intoning, or barking, North Korean propaganda. We also hear birdsong — a sweet contrast to the barking. Later, the artist will explain the birdsong.

In North Korean propaganda, he tells me, there is a line that goes something like this: “In the socialist paradise of Chairman Kim, even the birds sing for joy.” The artist recorded the birdsong outside his home in Germany. The talking is borrowed from North Korean state TV (the only kind of TV there is in dictatorships).

Our artist is Song Byeok, and the exhibition is hosted by the Oslo Freedom Forum, the annual human-rights gathering here in the Norwegian capital. Song Byeok was once a North Korean propagandist, painting images that celebrated the regime. He would show, for example, happy laborers, working their hearts out for whichever Kim was in power. Now, however, he paints images that are ironic or satirical. For instance, we see a picture of Kim Jong-un with a dove of peace. In one of the chairman’s hands is a bottle of Coca-Cola; with the other, he is giving a thumbs-up.

What does this mean, precisely? I’m not sure, but I bet Chairman Kim wouldn’t like it.

Many of the pictures are in the pop-art style. Indeed, Song Byeok has been called the “Andy Warhol of North Korea.” But he has other styles as well. On one wall, for example, there is a string of pictures that tell the artist’s life story. It speaks for the lives of North Koreans in general, too. The pictures are simple, direct, and affecting. They are hard to bear, for they depict terrible things, including famine, brutality, and death.

The last of the pictures is a handprint. One of the fingers is severed. Song Byeok lost this finger, or most of it, during one of his terms in prison. When I shake his hand — I think of the picture.

To the guests at the exhibition, he says a few words, through his interpreter, Seongmin Lee, who is also from North Korea, and works for the Human Rights Foundation, which stages the Oslo Freedom Forum. (HRF is based in New York.) Song Byeok talks of hunger, which is hard to understand, he says, for those who have never experienced it. And by “hunger” he means outright starvation. “Nothing is more painful,” he says. “There is no greater suffering.” He saw parents abandon their children in the streets, unable to feed them. They would just die there.

Clearly, Song Byeok burns to tell North Korea’s story. He wants to shake the world by its shoulders. He wants to “speak up,” as he puts it, for those who cannot “speak for themselves.” At the end of his remarks, he says, “I ask you, in the name of justice, conscience, and morality, to help bring change to North Korean society.”

Then there is a candle-lighting ceremony, of a very unusual kind. Song Byeok has sculpted three candles, in the forms of Kim Jong-un, Vladimir Putin, and Xi Jinping. He asks someone to light the candles. His point is that nothing lasts forever. Everything melts away, and so it will be with these tyrants.

The next day, I sit down with Song Byeok, and Seongmin Lee, who interprets. With Song Byeok is his wife, Miran Choi, who is from South Korea. The artist is a slight man, with long black hair and large glasses. I have said “slight.” For all I know, he is on the robust side for someone born and raised in North Korea. The only fat person in the country may be the dictator.

I have a memory, from the early 2000s. Bill Clinton spoke to a group of journalists at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Weight requirements for the North Korean military kept getting lower, he said. When soldiers defected to us, they often weighed under 100 pounds.

Song Byeok was born in 1969 in North Hwanghae Province. He was indoctrinated into the cult of the Kim family, as all North Koreans are. They are taught to worship the ruling Kim as a god. They are also taught that North Korea is unique — uniquely good, uniquely prosperous, uniquely humane. In the words of a popular North Korean song, “We have nothing to envy in the world.”

Another memory, also from the early 2000s, as it happens. I asked Jeane Kirkpatrick about U.S. policy toward North Korea. (Kirkpatrick was a distinguished political scientist who served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations during President Reagan’s first term.) “North Korea is a psychotic state,” she said, “and the world has had very little experience of such states.” Plenty of dictatorships are evil — oppressive, murderous — without being psychotic.

At age 24, Song Byeok started working as a propaganda artist. He would do this for seven years. He took great pride in his work, performing it with enthusiasm. He was a true believer in the Kims — the Great Leader (Kim Il-sung) and the Dear Leader (Kim Jong-il). He painted slogans such as “Let us become a bullet for General Kim Jong-il!”

I ask him whether his work helped him survive. Did he gain privileges, because of the work he did? Extra food, for example? No (unfortunately). “There were no differences whatsoever.”

How did he learn to draw and paint, by the way? “I was self-taught,” he says. His parents couldn’t afford to send him to a university. He practiced at home, drawing members of his family.

A further question: How did he acquire the materials? The paper, pencils, brushes, and so on? His parents sacrificed for him (as parents do). They purchased these materials for him, with whatever savings they had.

When Song Byeok speaks, it is usually softly, and reflectively, and poignantly.

North Koreans have never had very much to eat. But in 1994, a horrific famine hit, lasting four years. Masses of people died of hunger. Reliable numbers are hard to come by. The dictatorship refers to this period as the “Arduous March” or “March of Suffering.”

Like other North Koreans, Song Byeok took bark from trees and boiled it, just to get something in his stomach. One of his artworks is a sculpture, resembling the branch of a tree — but a branch that has taken on the characteristics of an animal. It is titled “Hunger.”

Song Byeok’s father, desperate to feed the family, set out for China, looking for food. He took Song Byeok with him. They got to China and got some food. On their way back, however, they were caught by North Korean guards, who took their food. It is illegal to leave the country without permission. And to bring back food was especially audacious.

The guards beat Song Byeok’s father to a pulp. They knocked his teeth out. Song Byeok was shocked by this. “My father was always such a strong man,” he says. “He was the pillar of our house, the pillar of our family.” And to see him assaulted like this; to see him helpless . . .

Song Byeok says he can still see the faces of the men who beat his father.

The two of them, father and son, were in prison for three months. They did hard labor. When they were released, they set out for China again, naturally. What else could they do? They and their family needed food; there was almost none.

This time, Song Byeok’s father died at the border — in the Tumen River, which separates North Korea and China. He was swept away. Song Byeok could not save him. He went to a checkpoint and asked the guards — North Koreans — to help save his father. Not only did they refuse, they said, “Why did you survive? You should have died in the river too.” Then they beat him up and threw him in prison.

Decisively, Song Byeok broke with North Korea. He broke with it mentally and spiritually. He broke with it, he tells me, when he saw his father’s face, as his father drifted away in the river.

Song Byeok had questions — angry questions: What kind of country makes it illegal for a man to get food when his family is starving? What kind of country treats its citizens this way? How can the Kims love us and allow this to happen?

He was full of “hatred,” he says — hatred for “the system.”

In prison, he saw inmates die beside him. One of his pictures memorializes this. It is called “Countdown.” A caption beneath it says, “When will it be my turn?” I ask Song Byeok whether the inmates died of starvation, torture, or both. He says they died of overwork, essentially. They did not get enough food for the hard labor they were forced to carry out. Song Byeok himself withered to almost nothing. He weighed about 65 pounds.

Another of his pictures is titled “Happiness.” There he is, emaciated, looking out a prison window. He longs to die, longs for the release of death. But, in reality, he kept waking up, which puzzled and disappointed him. Why didn’t he die, like the others?

After six months, the authorities released him. When I ask him why, he whispers the answer: “They don’t like to handle dead bodies. They don’t like to deal with corpses.” Song Byeok was at the point of death. They wanted him to die outside, not inside.

The warden gave him three packets of sugar. Then Song Byeok stepped out of the prison — and a strange feeling overcame him: an “attachment to life,” as he puts it. “I realized the importance of life. I wanted to live, no matter what.” And he was absolutely determined to leave North Korea, whatever it took.

He went to his uncle’s, rather than his mother’s. He did not want her to see him in his emaciated condition. He recuperated at his uncle’s. Then he went to his mother’s, to say goodbye. She gave him a small pouch with some red beans and some salt. According to Korean folklore, red beans contain good luck and the scattering of salt can drive away demons.

Once more, Song Byeok set out for China. His journey was dramatic –another terrifying experience in his life — but he made it across the river, never to turn back.

In China, he saw something remarkable: People gave animals, such as pigs, white rice to eat. In North Korea, that was a distant dream, for many people: white rice to eat.

When he got to South Korea, in 2002, he saw something even more remarkable: hospitals for animals. Also, he heard about “animal rights.” In North Korea, very few people had access to hospitals. And no one had rights.

There was electricity for 24 hours a day, in South Korea. There was hot water, too. These things seemed miraculous. Also, government officials treated you decently. They didn’t yell at you or beat you up. You were a human being, not a nonentity to be hit, killed, etc.

Song Byeok had a hard time with food — the abundance of it. The mere availability of it. He cried before it. How could he eat it, with his family going without? While he was in prison, one of his sisters had died of starvation. His mother would soon die of the same. His other sister, he would help escape North Korea.

One of the reasons that Song Byeok hates the North Korean system is that it is a destroyer of families, and he is a cherisher of the family. The system destroyed his family, he says, and it has destroyed countless other families.

In South Korea, Song Byeok received a college education. He earned both a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree. He taught at a South Korean university, too. Today, he and his wife live in Frankfurt.

He has presented his work in various parts of the world, including the United States. North Korea is never far from his mind. He feels a responsibility to those he left behind, so to speak: his countrymen.

He has a recurring nightmare. Back in North Korea, he is having a meal with his mother and sister (the sister who perished). Suddenly, the police burst in, and his mother tells him to flee. He jumps out a window, but when he lands, he can’t walk. He can’t move. Then he wakes up, soaked in sweat.

Over the years, I have met many North Koreans, mainly at the Oslo Freedom Forum. They are all compelled to bear witness: to tell the world about the unbelievable — namely, the horror of life, and death, in North Korea.

Remember them, says Song Byeok. Remember the North Koreans. They have no freedom whatsoever. No freedom and no material comfort. (Those things go hand in hand.) Some of them die trying to get to freedom — in the Tumen River, in the Gobi Desert. Remember them. The rest of us are so lucky.",A man stands between two large paintings in a dimly lit room with wooden floors and a black curtain in the background.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x131 at 0x7D6BA3AF0880>,2024-06-17 10:30:45+00:00,https://www.nationalreview.com,https://www.nationalreview.com/2024/06/depicting-north-korea-2/,['International' 'Politics'],[0.9 0.8],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/96185b0f63.png
983a592323,Global News Toronto,Another delay in sentencing of prolific B.C. COVID-protocol protester - Global News Toronto,"The sentencing hearing for a high-profile COVID-protocol protester who was convicted of assault last year has been postponed.

David Lindsay was set to be sentenced Wednesday for an assault conviction related to an Aug. 19, 2021 incident at a Kelowna Interior Health building but he didn’t show up.

His girlfriend appeared in his stead, explaining that while Lindsay was alert and awake, he was in the hospital “in pain” and with a “hoarse” voice.

Judge Cathaline Heinrichs summarized a note she was handed to those gathered in the courtroom.

On Interior Health stationery, she said Lindsay’s doctor said the prolific protester had a medical condition that required attention for 24 hours if not longer.

At that point, it was decided the matter at hand would be put off further because, as Crown coun. David Grabavac pointed out, that it’s only fair to allow Lindsay to be allowed to fully participate in the hearing, and it would be “one less ground for appeal” if they waited.

Instead, Heinrichs scheduled a Friday, July 12 check-in at the courthouse, via email if need be, to set the next best date for sentencing.

Grabavac aims to have the sentencing process complete by the end of July because Lindsay has already filed an appeal and the first court date for the appeal of the conviction he’s yet to be sentenced for is July 22.

It was a slightly convoluted end to what should have been a straightforward process, but that’s in line with the trial that’s lurched ahead in fits and starts and stretched well beyond the three days it was scheduled to be held in March 2023.

Lindsay was convicted last December of two counts of assault, in addition to one count of contempt of court.

he got into a conflict with Gregory Smith, the manager of protection services at Interior Health, on Aug. 19, 2021.

When Smith testified last year, he indicated he told Lindsay not to enter the Interior Health building but that his order was ignored.

“When Mr. Lindsay started to approach the doorway, what, if anything, did you do with your body to get ready for it?” Grabavac asked Smith in March as the remarkably slow trial continued.

“I placed my feet and my body in a supportive position anticipating his trying to push past,” Smith said.

be5f7ff8f6,USA TODAY,"From student debt to Title IX reform, how Project 2025 could alter these people's lives - USA TODAY","The Republican Party has a long wish list of things it hopes to change about American schools. High on it is abolishing the Education Department and establishing a national “Parents’ Bill of Rights” to give conservatives more control over what their children learn.

But members of the GOP are not all on the same page about how a Republican president should go about overhauling the country's education system.

One much-touted approach to revamping schools occupies a chapter of Project 2025, the 900-page political blueprint written by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. Despite the group's deep ties to his administration, former President Donald Trump, the party’s nominee and standard-bearer, has distanced himself from the agenda, adopting his own, simpler version of a party platform blessed by delegates at the Republican National Convention last week.

There remains a significant overlap between the two visions of changing how schools run. Both platforms echo long-standing Republican grievances. They accuse colleges of liberal indoctrination. They denounce the steep costs of higher education and bolster the rights of parents over those of children and educators. They recoil at the notion of protecting LGBTQ+ students or backing built-in protections for marginalized communities.

Though many of these ideas are far from becoming reality, both conservative plans would have real implications for millions of Americans. Project 2025 has already taken an outsize role in the presidential election as Democrats seize on its details to paint a dire picture of the changes that conservatives envision for schools.

As the presidential election draws nearer – and the country's political climate becomes increasingly fraught – students and families in vulnerable circumstances are growing more anxious about how the political fighting could alter their lives.

GOP agenda would deal a major blow to student debt relief

Angel Torrientes lives with her 16-year-old son in a one-bedroom apartment in Covina, California, about 20 miles east of Los Angeles. She gets the bedroom, and “he has his space,” she said.

She always wanted to find a job where she could help people. That impulse ultimately drew her to nonprofit work, and she graduated in 2018 with a master’s degree in nonprofit management from Antioch University in Los Angeles. She now has two jobs: one is full-time, at a youth services nonprofit, where she helps train employees who work with disadvantaged young people, and the other is a part-time gig at a housing company.

Affording $2,000 in rent is hard enough on her salary. Paying off the $80,000 she owes in student loan debt makes life even harder.

But a federal government program intended to help people in mission-oriented jobs like hers has been a lifesaver, she said. Enrolling in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, or PSLF, which was revamped during the Biden administration, lowered her monthly loan payment by hundreds of dollars.

Project 2025 would end it. Lindsey Burke, the author of the Project 2025 education agenda, has argued that the federal government has abused its debt relief powers, prioritizing public-sector jobs over private-sector ones and unfairly leaving taxpayers on the hook for other people’s degrees. The Heritage Foundation said Burke was unavailable for an interview with USA TODAY.

Without the financial cushion the loan repayment program has given her, Torrientes said she’s not sure how she would make rent.

“How do I continue to do everything I need to do if my payments might come back to $500 a month?” she said. “Is the object to keep me poor and then complain when I’m on services?”

Kevin Roberts, the Heritage Foundation's president, told USA TODAY last week that the group's policy agenda is a necessary solution to the federal government overreach that progressives have implemented.

""Project 2025 is an attempt to restore proper constitutional order to this country,"" he said.

Proposed changes to special education cause alarm

Mia Charles was scared when she found out her son had autism. Charles, who lives in Brooklyn with her aunt, didn’t know the first thing about the developmental disorder, which affected as many as 1 in 36 youth in 2020, according to federal government estimates from some regions of the U.S.

“It was a big shock,” Charles said.

The diagnosis came in 2021 when her son, Maverick, was 3. It was about two years after a district court ruled the Trump administration had engaged in an “illegal delay” by refusing to enact Obama-era regulations meant to improve racial disparities in special education.

Project 2025 proposes rescinding those rules completely. It also calls for removing enforcement of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, a landmark federal law that ensures students with disabilities are entitled to a “free appropriate public education,” by Education Department officials and handing the task to the Department of Health and Human Services.

Denise Marshall, CEO of the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, a disability rights group, acknowledged that the Education Department has historically struggled to ensure that schools are in compliance with IDEA. But shifting enforcement to a different federal agency that lacks the necessary expertise would not be a good move, she said.

“I don’t think they understand the repercussions on kids,” she said.

Across the country, parents such as Charles feel safer sending their children off to school each day knowing their rights are protected by federal regulations.

“It’s not easy to give our kids to the world,” she said.

LGBTQ+ students targeted

Via Lipman remembers when she was the only gay student at her high school. Being out in Naples, Florida, during the age of the “Don’t Say Gay” law, as opponents called it, wasn’t easy, she said.

Whenever the topic of LGBTQ+ people came up in class, she sensed all eyes turn to her. Though she grew up in an accepting family, she felt her school environment becoming less inclusive as homophobic and transphobic rhetoric in the broader culture seeped into everyday interactions.

“You’re very alone,” she said.

Lipman supports the Biden administration's efforts to codify protections for queer and trans students like her. After a yearslong delay, the Education Department this year finalized its rewrite of Title IX, the federal statute that prevents sex-based misconduct in schools that receive federal funding.

The new guidance, set to take effect Aug. 1, would expand the definition of sex in the law to include sexual orientation and gender identity. But in recent weeks, the courts have blocked the Biden administration's rewrite in more than a dozen states and at hundreds of colleges.

Lipman hopes the new guidance will prevail. On Monday the Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to curb the lower courts' bans.

Project 2025 veers hard in the other direction. It would allow schools to out LGBTQ+ students to their parents and define sex “to mean only biological sex recognized at birth.""

“The next Administration should take particular note of how radical gender ideology is having a devastating effect on school-aged children today,” the policy agenda says.

Lipman, now a 19-year-old rising sophomore at Stanford University, said her educational experience has changed since she moved to California. She no longer feels so alone.

She worries, though, about the LGBTQ+ students in communities that aren't as welcoming.

“I’m a little bit jealous of the people in high school who never had to feel that way,” she said.

On Monday, Charlotte Alter and Time Magazine reintroduced us to the already well-known vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris, describing the energy at her early August Pennsylvania rally as Barack Obama-reborn. A 14,000-strong “exuberant” crowd filled the stands, cheering for “more than one minute,” wearing light-up bracelets like those of Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour while holding homemade signs encrusted with “glitter and glue.”

We’re told that fundraising goals are now being “smashed,” stadiums “packed” and that TikTok has been “dominated.” Grassroots fundraising and volunteers have been “seeing an explosion” in participation. Celebrities, including pop stars and rappers such as Charli XCX, who christened Harris as “brat,” and Megan Thee Stallion, have shown up to offer support. Some labour union president called her a “badass woman.” Her Harris-Walz camo hats even “sold out within half an hour.”

More importantly, someone’s niece is happy “Genocide Joe” is gone, and digital Gen Z users in the “coconut tree” of the “K-Hive” are breathing a sigh of relief, finally free to express their true feelings about Israel.

After a “blockbuster summer of Barbie, Beyoncé and Swift,” Atler suggests that, maybe, all the “hand-wringing” about electing a woman will finally end …

The “Her Moment” cover set to accompany Alter’s piece in Time’s Aug. 26 magazine features a large vignette of Harris’s face. She’s surrounded by campaign signs displaying “Kamala” and the slogan When We Fight, We Win in blue and white, which, at the outer edge, fade out with a nostalgic softness usually reserved for distant history. A steely blue-grey Harris gazes upwards, as if to the heavens: proud, confident, already victorious, somehow haunting us from a glorious past that never happened. But of course, Harris’s race has barely started, and it certainly hasn’t been won.

The image communicates a woman memorialized as an icon of American progress and accomplisher of great things, instead of what she actually is: a current, and rather untested, presidential candidate with an undeniably poor track record the last time she ran for Democratic leadership. Looking at it made me wonder, is Time trying to manifest this vibe-shift “brat” future into being? Are they trying to make fetch happen?

Other outlets similarly fawned over Harris as a transformational figure. The Washington Post’s Jonathan Capeheart wrote in 2022 that she “had to contend with the negative reactions and low expectations that come with shattering ossified notions of who should be (president)”. The same day, Vanity Fair’s Molly Jong-Fast suggested that Harris is “way friendlier and more accommodating than a man in her position would ever be.” Just last week, Katie Rogers of the New York Times referred to her as “emanating joy.”

I searched for other Time covers with grey-blue faces, seeking out other living politicians with such a cover — maybe Hillary Clinton or Obama — to find out their significance. Nope. One cover did pop up, though: it was the March 16, 1953 edition depicting a recently deceased Joseph Stalin, of all people.

Time, obviously not commemorating Harris’s recent passing or a massive historical event, seems to serve as a hagiography — an idolizing biography typically reserved for saints or venerated persons. Hagiographies describe these individuals as perfect or much better than they are in reality, often in service of a political agenda.

Indeed, with the exception of gently pointing out that Harris has held positions in her past that she needs to “explain” in interviews that she has yet to agree to, the article paints her as suppressed by President Joe Biden and campaign members, forbidden from shining her light, saddled cruelly with what Atler refers to as the “difficult” and “thankless work” of investigating the root causes of illegal immigration from Central America.

And now that Biden is finally gone, Atler tells us that Harris is tasked with cleaning up the mess his administration made while she was vice-president, such as ruptures in the party and its losses of Black, Hispanic, Arab and young voters in recent years.

Now Harris emerges from Biden’s shadow to do the saintly work she has always been destined to do, work we are told she has been planning in the background since 2022. Many meetings were had. Powerbrokers were consulted. Allies were spreadsheeted.

The takeaway is that Harris herself is “what can be, unburdened by what has been,” to borrow one of her more memorable phrases. Un-Bidened from what has been, if you will.

The glorification of Harris and her campaign all seems very strange, considering that the press and Democrats have constantly critiqued Donald Trump for similarly campaigning on a cult of personality. Not unlike Trump, as Atler points out, Harris and the Democrats are now placing emphasis on feelings, energy and “viral memes” — anything that can “snatch the spotlight away from (Trump).” I mean, are MAGA and camo hats really all that different?

More to the point, this iconic, Obama-esque Harris appears to have been invented from whole cloth less than a month ago, as if she had been grown in a Democratic campaign vat precisely for this purpose. There is little evidence that before Biden stepped down, anyone thought of Harris at all in this way.

Look. It’s cynical, it’s artificial, it’s hypocritical and it just might work. Political cults of personality rely not on whether someone is the best candidate, knows all the facts or has the better policies. They rely on the ability of voters to project their fears and desires onto a willing candidate who will wear them proudly in an imagined Epic Rap Battle against the other side. Republicans have their champion in Trump and Democrats now in Harris — it’s no accident they both use the word “fight.”

25371ae405,Financial Times,Punishing SNP losses fuel speculation over the party’s purpose - Financial Times,"The wounding scale of the Scottish National party’s defeat has raised questions over its raison d'être — independence — and fuelled Scottish Labour’s momentum ahead of Holyrood elections in 2026.

In its worst general election result since 2010, the SNP lost dozens of Westminster seats to Labour as the muscle memory of central belt voters returned them to the bosom of the party they abandoned a decade ago.

With one Highland seat delayed by a recount until Saturday, Scotland’s governing party had won only nine seats in the House of Commons, compared with 37 for Labour and five each for the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.

Labour, which won just one seat in Scotland in 2019, has emphatically become Scotland’s largest Westminster party, as part of Sir Keir Starmer’s national landslide victory, fuelled by concerns about the scandal-ridden SNP’s record in government.

“The scale of the SNP’s loss has undoubtedly set back the cause of independence, at least for now,” said Chris Deerin, director of Reform Scotland, a think-tank.

“It’ll be hard if not impossible for the SNP to push Starmer for a second referendum given the Scottish electorate has just reduced it to nine MPs — where is the moral or political authority?” he added.

John Swinney, who became SNP leader and Scottish first minister just two months ago, pledged to reflect on the party’s approach to independence in the wake of the results, which he said were “very, very difficult and damaging”.

“I have to accept we failed to convince people of the urgency of independence,” he said. “Therefore, we need to take the time to consider and reflect how we deliver our commitment to independence, which is absolute.”

The first minister pledged to “sort out” the party before the Scottish parliamentary elections in 2026, arguing that the roughly 50 per cent of Scots who still believe in independence presented a “formidable expression of support”.

One SNP figure said it was impossible to sugarcoat the drubbing his party had received, but said Swinney would approach the disaster as the “ultimate gradualist” who believes in building the case for independence through competence.

Seventeen years in power had muddied the Scottish government’s vision, he added, channelling Tory strategist Lynton Crosby: “It’s time to clear the barnacles from the boat.”

Under former first minister Nicola Sturgeon, the party moved into a dominant position in Scotland in 2015, a year after Scots voted in a referendum to remain within the UK.

That so-called yellow wave dramatically ebbed away on Thursday night. The party — in power in the Scottish parliament in Holyrood for 17 years — has been tarnished by a series of scandals over its finances, while opinion polls suggested voters were disappointed with its record in areas such as healthcare, education and transport.

“Voters have made it clear that they want and expect the SNP to focus on the issues that matter to them — fixing our ailing public services and growing the economy — rather than obsessing about tearing up the UK,” said Scottish Conservative chair Craig Hoy.

The SNP will go from the third- to fourth-largest party in the House of Commons. This will hit its public profile, as its leaders had been able to use guaranteed airtime during prime minister’s questions to agitate on issues such as Brexit and the Israel-Hamas war.

The party, already facing a squeeze in donations, will also lose a proportion of its public funding after slipping down the ranking of parties at Westminster.

Swinney conceded the dramatic loss of MPs would have financial implications for the party, and that would need to be considered as part of his work to strengthen the organisation.

Labour retook seats across the populous central belt from Inverclyde, to the west of Glasgow, through the post-industrial heartlands to Edinburgh and beyond, as far east as East Lothian and Fife.

Joanna Cherry, SNP candidate for Edinburgh South West, was a high-profile casualty in Edinburgh, where Labour won four of five seats. Christine Jardine held Edinburgh West for the Lib Dems, one of five wins for the party.

The Conservatives have won three seats in Scotland. Douglas Ross lost out to the SNP in Aberdeenshire North and Moray East, impeded by a strong showing for Reform UK. Ross will step down as leader of the Scottish Conservatives but remain as an MSP at Holyrood.

The turnaround in Labour’s fortunes north of the border under the leadership of Anas Sarwar has been boosted by an active campaign in Scotland, with several high-profile visits by Starmer and senior Labour figures.

“The scale of Scottish Labour’s victory surely puts it in pole position for Holyrood 2026,” said Deerin. “This doesn’t feel like voters sending a warning shot across the SNP’s bows, but rather an electorate that is starting to move away from the party.”",A bald man in a suit stands in front of a backdrop with the text 'SNP FOR SCO' against a blue background.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA4A88EE0>,2024-07-05 17:56:24.519000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/7e9993b5-94af-4b02-a134-6e4c04cb0dee,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/25371ae405.png

The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Thursday said that the former president will be facing additional federal charges in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case. Trump pleaded not guilty to 37 charges, including 31 counts of willful retention of national defense information, in June after federal prosecutors indicted him for allegedly illegally removing classified documents, at least one of which dealt with U.S. military plans, when vacating the White House in January 2021 and obstructing government efforts to retrieve them. While speaking with NBC host Willie Geist on Sunday Today with Willie Geist, Todd was asked if anything could change Trump's double-digit lead in the Republican primaries. ""Not right now...one of the things we're trying to focus people's attention to is what this calendar is starting to look like in the first six months of 2024,"" Todd said.

The investigation later expanded to probe allegations of ""a multi-state, coordinated plan"" between Trump and his allies to influence the results of 2020 election across the country. Trump has maintained his innocence in Willis' probe. As Trump's legal troubles continue to mount, his luck in the polls does not falter. A YouGov/The Economist poll conducted among 1,500 adults from July 22 to 25 found that 55 percent of respondents planned to vote for Trump in the 2024 primary. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, long viewed as the candidate with the greatest chance of beating him, only received support from 18 percent of voters, while other candidates polled in the single digits. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points. Political analyst and Dillard University professor Robert Collins told Newsweek on Sunday that the former president ""does not see it as a disservice to voters to continue running while under indictment because he sees the indictments as a way to make himself a martyr in the eyes of the voters."" Collins added: ""He is using them to his advantage. Furthermore, Trump sees continuing to run for office as his best legal strategy. He will attempt to use the election as an excuse to ask the courts to delay the trials until after Election Day."" Trump took to Truth Social, his social media platform, on Saturday to address the new charges by the DOJ and wrote, ""Why did the Radical Left Democrat Prosecutors wait so long to bring these ridiculous cases against me.

a7926b3184,CBS News,"Passive income ideas that really work, according to experts - CBS News","With inflation and interest rates high, many Americans are looking for ways to pad their income and ease the financial strain. Passive income streams are one way to do it. You can create passive income in endless ways. And though paid surveys are often mentioned in this capacity, they take regular legwork and will require time to pay off.

Don't fret, though. There are still some expert-backed passive income strategies that actually work. So, if you're looking to increase your income without putting in a lot of day-to-day effort it helps to know your best options.

Earn more on your money by transferring some to a high-yield savings account now.

Passive income ideas that really work, according to experts

Here are four effective ways to generate passive income now, according to the experts we spoke to.

Open a high-yield savings account

If you really want guaranteed earnings, a high-yield savings account can offer it. In today's market, many accounts are offering 4% to 5% APYs or above - meaning about $500 on a $10,000 deposit annually.

This strategy also ""keeps your emergency fund safe and accessible but still allows it to earn money for you,"" says Kendall Meade, a certified financial planner for SoFi.

Certificate of deposit (CDs) are a similar type of investment, only you need to keep the money untouched for a few months or years. You'll then get a guaranteed return once the account matures.

See how much more you could be earning on your money with a high-yield savings account here.

Rent out your property (or closet space)

Renting out properties — as with Airbnb or VRBO, for instance — is a good way to make passive income, experts say. With properties, there's a big upfront investment, but if you bring in a property manager to handle the booking, cleaning, and marketing of the property, all you're left with is a cut of the rents.

You can also rent properties out to full-time tenants. Again, you'd need to hire a manager to deal with repairs and other on-site issues, but other than that, it could offer stable, monthly earnings for the long haul.

If you don't have a full property to rent (or can't buy one), you can also use various apps to rent out storage space (Neighbor), parking space (SpotHero), yard space (Sniffspot), or a pool (Swimply) you already own. All it takes is setting up a profile and accepting bookings once they come in.

Rent out your belongings

You can also rent items out around your home — tools, outdoor gear, sporting goods, party equipment, and more — using tools like RentMy, Fat Llama, or Yoodlize. According to Emily Haleck, head of public relations at at Yoodize one user made $7,000 in the last two years by renting out his paddle boards on the app.

""He paid those off, then bought four more the next summer, paid those off, and was renting out up to 22 boards at a time last summer,"" Haleck says. ""He has more than tripled his initial investment of $1,650 — and that's from renting them out only three months of the year.""

Another user apparently rents out her children's ski gear — skis, helmets, goggles, snow pants, and more — and makes around $1,700 every winter.

Buy into REITs

REITS — or Real Estate Investment Trusts — are another way to capitalize on real estate. With these, you purchase shares of companies that own commercial real estate — income-producing properties like office buildings, apartments and more. You then get a cut of those earnings as an investor.

""By simply opening a brokerage account, you can own stock in real estate companies that own, operate and manage commercial real estate,"" says Ashley Fox, CEO and financial education specialist at Empify, a fintech startup. ""By investing in REITs, each month or quarter you will receive dividends — passive income — for every share you own.""

Fox estimates that REITs can deliver anywhere from 4 to 17% returns annually. ""And you can start with less than $200,"" she says.

Share your skills

Another option is to create educational content that generates cash. If you have specialized knowledge in a topic, you can create courses for online schools like Udemy or self-publish books and list them on Amazon. You then earn royalties based on sales of these items.

That's what investment advisor Andy LaPointe and founder of Traverse Bay Farms has done to create a passive income stream. ""I currently have over 4,400 students who have purchased my courses,"" he says.

LaPointe also has a YouTube channel he's working to get up and running. Once he reaches 4,000 viewed hours, he can start monetizing his content and earning cash through in-video advertisements. The best part, he says, is that it required very little upfront investment. ""It simply just takes time to create the course and write the book,"" he says.

43e427cff0,Global News,Conservatives demand government explain how terror suspects immigrated to Canada - Global News,"Conservative House leader Andrew Scheer says Canadians have a right to know how a man with alleged links to a foreign terror group evaded Canada’s screening process to immigrate to Canada and become a citizen.

He is demanding that the House of Commons recall its public safety committee to dig into the situation, calling on the Bloc Québécois and NDP to support that request.

Ahmed Fouad Mostafa Eldidi, 62, and his son, Mostafa Eldidi, 26, were arrested in Richmond Hill, Ont. on July 28 and face nine different terrorism charges, including conspiracy to commit murder on behalf of the terror group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

Most charges relate to activities allegedly occurring in Canada, but the elder Eldidi is also charged with one count of aggravated assault outside Canada.

The request from Scheer comes after Global News first reported that sources say the charge stems from a video released by ISIS in 2015 that shows a man dismembering a prisoner with a sword.

The RCMP arrested the two men at a hotel as they were allegedly about to commit a terrorist attack for ISIS. Police seized a machete and axe at the scene.

While police told reporters both suspects are Canadians, Global News has learned the son does not hold citizenship in this country, and the father immigrated after the ISIS execution video was released.

In court last week both men denied the charges but neither have entered a formal plea.

Scheer says the government’s silence as to how two people with connections to a terror group successfully immigrated to Canada is unacceptable.

“This is a colossal failure of Trudeau’s national security system,” he said at a press conference on Parliament Hill Tuesday morning.

“Canadians have a right to know what went wrong. How did this individual gain entry into Canada and obtain Canadian citizenship. Canadians also have a right to know if … there’s anyone else in Canada with similar backgrounds who were granted entry into our country.”

The federal government has so far said very little about the matter.

Conservative MP and public safety critic Frank Caputo has written to Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc to ask him to make public all the details of the alleged terrorist plot, Scheer said.

He said LeBlanc would be the first witness he wants to call to committee.

5f08bcddd7,CNN,Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez found guilty in federal corruption trial; Chuck Schumer calls on him to resign - CNN,"A jury on Tuesday found Sen. Bob Menendez guilty on all counts in his federal corruption trial, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer swiftly called on his Democratic colleague to resign.

Menendez, of New Jersey, was convicted of 16 counts — including bribery, extortion, wire fraud, obstruction of justice and acting as a foreign agent — for his role in a yearslong bribery scheme.

The verdict is a staggering blow for the Democratic establishment in New Jersey, where longtime state powerbroker George Norcross faces a separate racketeering indictment, and a stain on the party’s national brand. Menendez, one of the most feared and influential figures in state politics, now faces decades in prison — and further questions about how he wielded his power as the former chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.

“Obviously, I’m deeply, deeply disappointed by the jury’s decision,” Menendez told reporters outside the courtroom. “I have every faith that the law and the facts did not sustain that decision and that we will be successful upon appeal.”

Menendez, who faces sentencing on October 29, maintained he never violated his public oath and has never been anything “but a patriot of my country and for my country.”

“I have never, ever been a foreign agent, and the decision rendered by the jury today would put at risk every member of the US Senate in terms of what they think a foreign agent would be,” he said.

Damian Williams, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, said after the verdict: “This wasn’t politics as usual; this was politics for profit.”

Menendez appeared to shake his head when the first guilty verdict against him was read. When the jury was finished, he leaned his elbows on the defense table with his hands clasped in front of his face. When the court officer announced there was a verdict and parties piled in, both Menendez’s daughter, Alicia Menendez, and his sister sat in silence, looking straight ahead and not speaking. They seemed to embrace once another.

As the senator left the courtroom, he walked over to his sister and daughter, spoke to them for a moment and left. They all had serious expressions on their faces. Menendez’s look was stern.

Verdict shakes up Senate picture

Even before his conviction, Menendez’s case sparked a revolt among rank-and-file Democrats against the state party machine, which has for decades run roughshod over outsider candidates. The race to replace him, which began shortly after Menendez was indicted, initially featured first lady Tammy Murphy. The surge of support for her from county party bosses, over the more popular Rep. Andy Kim, now the nominee, led to a grassroots backlash.

“This is a sad and somber day for New Jersey and our country,” Kim said in a statement Tuesday, “Our public servants should work for the people, and today we saw the people judge Senator Menendez as guilty and unfit to serve. I called on Senator Menendez to step down when these charges were first made public, and now that he has been found guilty, I believe the only course of action for him is to resign his seat immediately. The people of New Jersey deserve better.”

Should Menendez remain in the race as an independent candidate, that could split the Democratic vote, opening a path for Republican nominee Curtis Bashaw – a scenario Democrats are desperate to avoid given the many challenges they face in defending their narrow majority.

Schumer, who had previously refused to weigh in on whether Menendez should step down, immediately released a statement after the verdict was announced, saying that Menendez “must now do what is right for his constituents, the Senate, and our country, and resign.” From Menendez’s home state, Gov. Phil Murphy and Sen. Cory Booker, both Democrats, reiterated their previous calls for Menendez to step down, and many Democrats on Capitol Hill followed Schumer’s lead, including Judiciary Chairman and Majority Whip Dick Durbin.

If Menendez doesn’t resign, it would take a two-thirds vote in the Senate to remove him.

Sentencing set for October 29

Prosecutors successfully argued that the senator tried to use his power to advance Egyptian military interests, interfere in criminal prosecutions and secure investment from Qatari officials, among other things. Menendez and his wife allegedly received gold bars, hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, a Mercedes-Benz convertible and other bribes in exchange for his influence.

The senator’s wife, Nadine Menendez, was also charged in the case, but her trial was postponed indefinitely by the judge after her breast cancer diagnosis. She has pleaded not guilty.

The most serious charges of extortion and wire fraud carry a statutory maximum of 20 years in prison on each count. In all, Menendez faces a maximum of 222 years in prison for the 16 charges if served consecutively. However, any sentences would run concurrently unless the court orders otherwise.

Sentencing is scheduled for October 29, just a week before Election Day.

Menendez’s co-defendants, New Jersey businessmen Wael Hana and Fred Daibes, were also found guilty on all the counts they faced for their roles in the scheme. They declined to comment to reporters as they exited the courtroom on Tuesday.

Gold bars, cars and cash

Prosecutors spent nearly seven weeks untangling the multiple corruption schemes that they allege Bob and Nadine Menendez and the co-defendants were involved in.

Federal prosecutors structured their case by chapters, calling witnesses to testify about separate schemes allegedly brokered by the senator in tandem with his wife. According to evidence presented by prosecutors in court, the schemes were brokered involved Hana, Daibes and another co-conspirator, Jose Uribe, the New Jersey businessman who allegedly bribed the senator in exchange for legal favors. Uribe struck a plea deal ahead of the trial.

Uribe, one of the government’s star witnesses, testified that he bribed Menendez in exchange for his influence to attempt to sway top prosecutors in New Jersey from pursuing criminal cases against his associates. Uribe testified about the conspiracy and how he paid for Nadine Menendez’s Mercedes.

“I (agreed) with Nadine Menendez and other people to provide a car for Nadine in order to get the power and influence of Mr. Menendez,” Uribe testified, in order “to help me get a better resolution for one of my associates who was being charged in a criminal matter and to stop and kill investigations that could lead to my daughter and family members.”

Uribe testified that during a 2020 dinner, the senator told him in Spanish, “I saved your a** twice. Not once, but twice.”

Menendez’s attorney said Uribe, is a “good liar,” and “embellished” his testimony to “invent corroboration” with other evidence of text messages, phone calls, and restaurant meetings that were presented at trial adding that Uribe did not discuss anything criminal with the senator.

Prosecutors pointed to a meeting Menendez had with Gurbir Grewal, a former New Jersey attorney general, where Menendez allegedly brought up the cases of Uribe’s associates to sway top prosecutors, but his defense attorneys claimed the senator was concerned the cases were selective prosecutions against his Latino constituents.

Grewal testified that Menendez he never mentioned any defendants by name and the senator never asked him to interfere in any specific case but a colleague of the attorney general who was at the meeting called the interaction “gross.”

Prosecutors alleged Hana paid Nadine Menendez three checks of $10,000 set up a “sham job,” at IS EG Halal, Hana’s halal certification business, as a cover up for bribes and also made mortgage payments for her.

Federal prosecutors alleged that Menendez helped Hana protect a halal certification monopoly with the Egyptian government in exchange for giving Nadine Menendez gold bars, cash and paying her mortgage. Prosecutors also allege the senator pushed the country of Egypt’s agenda for years and signed off on military funding in exchange for the bribes.

Ted McKinney, a former top official at the US Department of Agriculture, testified that the senator told him in a call to stop interfering with his constituents after McKinney flagged concerns over the monopoly.

Sarah Arkin, a former senior Senate Foreign Relations staff member under Menendez, described the planning leading up to an October 2021 congressional delegation trip to Egypt and Qatar as “weird.”

Prosecutors allege Menendez ghost-wrote a letter for the Egyptian government to use to lobby other members of Congress over their concerns about the country’s human rights record.

“Menendez wasn’t acting weirdly, he was acting corruptly,” Monteleoni said. “He was acting like a bribed man, because that’s what he was.” The prosecutor told the jury these actions were part of a “broader pattern of corruption.”

Prosecutors alleged Menendez met with Egyptian intelligence officials on several occasions, including a Morton’s steakhouse dinner that was surveilled by FBI teams, and conspired with Hana to secure favorable military arms deals for Egypt.

Prosecutors say Menendez pushed Egypt’s agenda for years in the Senate – where he previously served as the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee – and signed off on millions in military funding in exchange for bribes from Hana.

Prosecutors allege that Daibes used the senator’s connections to secure a multimillion-dollar commercial real estate deal with a Qatari investment firm tied to members of the Qatari royal family. The jury saw messages between the senator and Qatari contacts, facilitating an introduction with Daibes. The senator also penned complimentary press releases about the Qatari government, which he instructed Daibes to flag to the Qatari investors to curry favor, records shown at trial revealed.

Fingerprints belonging to the senator and Daibes were found on cash-filled envelopes that were among the items seized from Nadine Menendez’s home, where the senator also lived, during an FBI raid. Serial numbers on gold bars also seized at the home during that raid revealed that Daibes had once possessed the gold, according to trial evidence.

Meanwhile, other text messages shown by prosecutors at the trial illustrated a timeline of how the senator pushed the nomination of Philip Sellinger, the current US attorney for the District of New Jersey.

Sellinger testified that Menendez had hoped the US attorney contender would look at a criminal case against Daibes “carefully” if he secured the position. But Sellinger also said he never felt pressured to tip the scales for Daibes.

During the trial, the senator’s lawyers called five witnesses, including his sister, sister-in-law and the attorney for a friend of Uribe. A Menendez lawyer said the senator customarily stored cash due to familial trauma caused by the Cuban communist regime. (Menendez was born in New York City, and Fidel Castro had not yet come to power at the time his family left Cuba.) In his closing argument, Menendez’s defense attorney said the lack of evidence in the case against the senator made it “shaky and rotten to its core.”

The senator’s sister, Caridad Gonzalez, testified that her family’s cash-storing practices were “normal.”

“It’s a Cuban thing,” Gonzalez, 80, said on the stand. “Every Cuban who came to the States in the early 50s, 60s, 70s” stored cash in their home and in boxes because “they were afraid of losing what they worked so hard for, because in Cuba, they took everything away from you.”

The FBI seized a total of $486,461, 11 one-ounce gold bars and two one-kilogram gold bars from the Menendez home on June 16, 2022.

Menendez’s attorneys consistently suggested in cross-examinations that the senator was not aware of the deals his wife struck with the co-defendants, which included offering the senator’s influence for a price.

Prosecutors alleged that Nadine Menendez was an intermediary for communications between the co-conspirators and her willing husband.

c28da59b1b,USA TODAY,'Swifties for Kamala' raise over $100k - even without Taylor there - USA TODAY,"Taylor Swift has yet to endorse a candidate this election season, but her fans, better known as Swifties, are already fundraising for the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris.

The Swifties for Kamala Coalition officially launched on Tuesday, with a lucrative debut of $142,000, during a star-studded two-hour virtual rally featuring singer Carole King and U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.

Many of the donations ranged from $13 to $19.89, a nod to the singer’s favorite number and the title of her fifth studio album.

The call began with remarks from Warren, who was greeted by a sea of heart emojis and cheers from the livestream chat.

“You are resilient, and you know how to take on bullies, and you know how to be your most authentic, most joyful selves,” Warren told the group. “And that is what the Kamala Harris campaign is all about. It’s about standing up for what is right in the face of bullies, like Donald Trump.”

Later in the call, King – who described Swift as her “musical and songwriting granddaughter” – sang her favorite song, “Shake It Off.” King also discussed her political activism: “I’ve been a volunteer, I’ve been doorknocker, even as a famous person.""

The call’s feel-good vibe almost made it seem like an impromptu meeting among Swifties, but the group has been hard at work since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race.

Emerald Medrano, 22, founded the group in June and now boasts a quarter million followers across its social media channels.

In an interview with The Cut, Medrano likened Harris to Swift, saying, “Harris is a very intelligent and powerful woman; she’s a trailblazer. The way she has opened doors and also takes care of the people who come after her through that door reminds me in a lot of ways of Taylor and the way she cares about people in the music industry.”

Medrano said that connection and the feeling that Harris truly cares about his rights and identity made him want to vote for the vice president.

Swift is not currently affiliated with the group, but those on the call, including Warren, hope she publicly supports Harris. The singer famously endorsed Biden for president less than a month before the 2020 election, a move from a superstar some had criticized as too apolitical.

Just last week, Trump posted a fake social media image of the pop superstar asking people to vote for him in the November election. The picture showed the winner of 14 Grammys dressed in red, white, and blue, with a caption that said, “Taylor Swift Wants You To Vote For Donald Trump.”

“I accept!” Trump wrote.

A spokesperson for Swift did not respond to a request for comment, according to Reuters.

9f34523240,CNN,Judge Chutkan could jumpstart Trump election interference case now that it’s back in her court - CNN,"A federal judge in Washington, DC, on Friday regained control of the criminal case against former President Donald Trump for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election, leaving the historic case’s fate in her hands less than 100 days before the November election.

The case was returned to Judge Tanya Chutkan one month after the Supreme Court issued a game-changing ruling on presidential power.

Chutkan has long signaled she wanted the case presented to a jury before voters go to the polls in November, initially pushing for a March trial date. But the Supreme Court interceded earlier this year and put the case on pause to consider Trump’s claims of presidential immunity.

By granting Trump sweeping immunity for official acts as president, the Supreme Court’s ruling may gut special counsel Jack Smith’s case. That leaves Chutkan with a number of crucial decisions to make, including whether Trump’s efforts to undo the 2020 election results count as official acts.

Attorneys working on the case believe that Chutkan will move quickly with the case back in her jurisdiction, according to sources familiar with their thinking. She could soon set the schedule for any upcoming hearings.

Meanwhile, prosecutors in Smith’s office have been preparing to move ahead with the case, even though they face a more difficult path as some evidence obtained in the investigation may be considered off limits because of the Supreme Court ruling, including testimony from former Vice President Mike Pence and other close Trump aides who worked in the White House.

Any move she makes will be under extreme scrutiny, given that it’s the only remaining federal case against Trump after the Florida federal judge overseeing his classified documents case, Aileen Cannon, dismissed those criminal charges against Trump and his two co-defendants.

As one attorney who practices in front of her said Chutkan “is very aware that the eyes of the world are on her.”

‘I wish I could go somewhere until it’s over, but I can’t.’

Chutkan has been on the federal bench for a decade. In the past three years, she has presided over dozens of January 6 criminal prosecutions, and is known as a harsh sentencer for those convicted of charges related to the US Capitol riot. Seated in her courtroom just blocks away from the Capitol, she is intimately familiar with the violence that unfolded that day and has warned Trump supporters in her court such an episode can never happen again.

“We’re running up against another bitterly contested election,” Chutkan told one riot defendant last month. “I wish I could go somewhere until it’s over, but I can’t.”

Since Chutkan was assigned the 2020 election interference case against Trump more than a year ago, she has kept Trump’s attorneys and the special counsel on a short leash in the courtroom and has often been quick to schedule hearings or rule on motions.

The judge already has decided 15 major pre-trial issues, ruling in favor of special counsel prosecutors in most of those. She’s also rejected a series of motions by Trump’s lawyers, including refusing to strike language that Trump believed was “inflammatory” from the indictment and to dismiss the case entirely based on his First Amendment claims.

Chutkan also approved Smith’s request to place Trump under a gag order for the duration of the case, but in a few instances she has dinged prosecutors, most recently for submitting court filings while the case was supposed to be on hold for the Supreme Court’s deliberations.

Attorneys who have practiced in front of Chutkan and some who went up against her when she was a public defender described her as “fair minded” and said that she “holds herself to a really, really high standard.” The attorneys spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the professional and ethical risks of speaking to press about a sitting federal judge.

“Tanya’s just above the fray,” one of the attorneys said. “She doesn’t make it personal. If she disagreed with you, she tells you.”

Push to get the case moving

While it’s still not clear when – if ever – the case will go to trial, observers believe Chutkan will move quickly to move the criminal proceedings along given her judicial style.

“She likes to move cases along,” the same attorney told CNN of Chutkan. “She doesn’t want to want a lot of talk, she’ll just rule.”

Five major motions are pending before the judge, four of which she could rule on immediately. Sources say that some of the attorneys involved in the case believe Chutkan may have worked on writing opinions for outstanding motions while the case was paused, and that those motions could quickly appear on the court docket.

Other attorneys have taken issue with her briskness in the Trump case, saying such a high-profile and complex prosecution should be treated differently, and that the former president shouldn’t be forced to go to trial before he is ready.

“The concept of any federal criminal case with that level of complexity being tried in under two years is really unheard of,” said Tim Parlatore, a former Trump attorney and CNN commentator.

Another one of the attorneys who practice in DC District Court told CNN they believe Chutkan “would try, if she could” to get Trump’s case before a jury before his inauguration in 2025, should he win the presidency and the case presumably goes away.

“In her defense, she likes to move her docket,” the attorney said of the fast pace Chutkan keeps in her courtroom. “If in her mind she thinks that Trump is trying to run the clock out, she would try to not allow it.”

Chutkan v. Cannon

The scrutiny around Chutkan is particularly intense after Cannon, the federal judge in Florida, dismissed a separate indictment against Trump for his alleged mishandling of classified documents.

Chutkan and Cannon can appear diametrically opposed, from their careers to their demeanors. Chutkan was a public defender earlier in her career, while Cannon was a prosecutor.

Cannon appeared to hold hearings on nearly every motion in the Trump case before her, but Chutkan often rules without hearing from the parties in person. And while Cannon was criticized for moving too slowly, playing into Trump’s strategy of delay, critics say Chutkan moving so quickly through the case is unfair.

One person close to Chutkan told CNN that she does seek counsel in other judges, particularly from those in the same courthouse, while those around Cannon have described her as isolated and not prone to seek counsel on how to handle any complex matters.

But the two have been accused of the same thing: putting their thumbs on the scale during two of the highest profile and consequential criminal cases in recent American history.

To be sure, the two Trump cases involve vastly different facts and legal issues. And the attorneys are taking different approaches – most notably with the special counsel’s office. In Florida, Trump’s lawyers argued that Smith’s appointment was unconstitutional – and won.

In Washington, Trump’s lawyers have said publicly they don’t plan to lodge such a challenge, so that’s one dispute Chutkan won’t have to decide.

dabe06481c,USA TODAY,Harris-Walz camo hat is having a moment. Could it be bigger than MAGA red? - USA TODAY,"When Kamala Harris picked up the phone and asked Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday morning, Minnesota’s governor was sitting on a wicker chair in his St. Paul home wearing khakis and his customary camouflage hat.

“I would be honored, Madam Vice President,” replied Walz, a former high school football coach who hunts and fishes in his free time.

Soon, his Midwestern dad vibe was fueling social media memes comparing him to pop music star Chappell Roan, who has a “Midwest Princess” camo hat in her official merch line-up.

Riffing off the memes, the Harris campaign designed and produced a prototype within hours. By that evening in Philadelphia, Walz had the soon-to-be-viral hat in hand and tweeted a photo wearing it.

The $40 Harris Walz hat – union-made by New Jersey-based manufacturer Unionwear – was an instant hit.

The initial run of 3,000 hats sold out in less than 30 minutes, and the campaign has rung up more than $1 million in hat sales since the merch dropped Tuesday. Thousands more hats are on back-order until October. Sales of the hats benefit the Harris Victory Fund.

“Is this real,” Roan wrote on X over side-by-side images of her “Midwest Princess” hat next to the new Harris-Walz camo hat.

Mitch Cahn, Unionwear’s CEO, said he has sold about 100,000 Kamala hats for the campaign, the Democratic party, the Democratic convention and other merchandisers since Harris launched her campaign on July 21.

About a quarter of those, according to Cahn, are the camo hats.

Cahn said he expected a bump in sales after Biden dropped out of the race last month. But getting “absolutely crushed with business” was a surprise.

“We are going to have to add a second shift and work weekends at least for the next two months with the demand that we anticipate,” he told USA TODAY.

Campaigns often sell branded camo hats to appeal to red-state voters. These days, Carhartt-inspired camo has urban crossover appeal, as in vogue in New York cafes as it is on deer hunts in Minnesota. But can this upstart headpiece topple the undisputed king of campaign merch Donald Trump?

Campaign merch can generate ""significant dollars,"" said Bruce Newman, founding editor-in-chief of the Journal of Political Marketing and a professor of marketing at DePaul University.

Spending on promotional products during the 2024 election is expected to reach $115 million, a 34% increase from the 2020 election, according to PQ Media, a market research firm based in Stamford, Connecticut.

""It’s definitely not at the top of the pyramid, but it pays some of the bills,"" Newman said. ""It’s also a marketing tool. You’re telling the world who you are and what you’ll do for them.""

Trump is in a class of his own when it comes to capitalizing on campaign merch, from golden sneakers to perfume. His iconic red MAGA hat is the stuff of merch legend.

Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner wrote in his memoir that the “Make America Great Again” hat brought in up to $80,000 a day during the 2016 presidential run, covering most of the campaign’s overhead costs.

""Trump wore the hat on his visit to the southern border, and it became the hottest thing on the internet,"" Kushner wrote in “Breaking History.”

No one has mastered the meme-to-merch pipeline quite like the MAGA universe, which milks political highlights to market T-shirts and trinkets.

Even Trump’s scowl in his booking photo made its way onto mugs and NFTs in his campaign store. After he was taken into custody, the campaign sold bumper stickers and beverage coolers with the tagline: “NEVER SURRENDER!” Trump also sold pieces of the blue suit and red tie he wore in the mugshot.

Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said the former president raised more than $4 million the day after he was booked at an Atlanta jail, at the time the highest-grossing day of the campaign.

The MAGA merchandise cottage industry roared into overdrive after Trump survived the assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, hawking products featuring the bloodied but defiant former president clenching his fist.

From T-shirts emblazoned with the rallying cry “Fight! Fight! Fight!” to ""You Missed"" shot glasses, the merch was a hot seller online and at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.

Will the camo hat be more than a folksy flash in the pan?

Unionwear hasn’t produced merch for the Trump campaign in the last two election cycles, but Cahn said the initial Kamala-Walz hat demand exceeds the initial demand for the MAGA hats his company made in 2016.

It's not clear exactly how many MAGA hat sales are sold today. The Trump campaign did not immediately return a request for comment, and Cahn estimates that ""most"" MAGA hats are not sold by the campaign but by online and street vendors.

“Kamala has just completely taken everybody by surprise on this,” Cahn said. “We've seen so many units sold in such a short period of time. And as the merchandise gets out there, as more people see it, I think it's really going to take on a life of its own.”","A man in a blue shirt and camouflage hat is holding a green drink, with other people in the background, one of whom is wearing a blue cap.

ff0cd5b5be,The Globe and Mail,The only really effective way to rein in Big Tech - The Globe and Mail,"Tax Big Tech from Toronto to Timbuktu? Break it to bits? Pandering politicians worldwide claim tech’s behemoths are too dominant – and that requires regulatory crackdowns.

You hear Canadian regulators touting international tech taxes They aren’t alone. European politicians yapped endlessly about “fixes” during the run-up to recent European Union elections. America’s looming November vote fans similar break-up-the-biggies talk.

The Fine them! Tax them! Break them up! mentality is exemplified by Uncle Sam’s lawsuit alleging Apple Inc.’s smartphone is a “monopoly.” That’s just one example. Canada’s years-long antitrust probe into Google’s online advertising practices is another. Pundits mindlessly nod, seeing government as surely right to step in.

No! It is all dangerously wrong nonsense.

Whatever you think of Big Tech (or other behemoths), political fixes aren’t the answer.

Government intervention isn’t needed. Capitalism’s secret lifeblood – plus patience – renders such plans counterproductive. Here is how.

Creative destruction – the non-stop churn of new startups outthinking, outflanking and replacing slowly aging giants – solves the dilemma naturally. It always has. It is a near-perfect self-regulatory feature.

It is Adam Smith’s legendary “invisible hand” of 1776, which guides open markets.

Hugeness creates unbelievably vast profits. As firms grow into societal Goliaths, entrepreneurial Davids see opportunities. The old, now-fattened hunters become the hunted. A tiny minority of entrepreneurial innovators successfully emerge, rise and overthrow old titans who can’t change, adapt or innovate fast enough.

It takes 10 or 20 years – rarely more. I have watched this perpetual marketplace saga for 50-plus years and always known it. Dominance isn’t permanence, ever.

To see it, consider the largest 20 global companies by market capitalization in 1970, 1990, 2010 and now. From 1970′s tally, just seven made 1990′s list – with several from then-booming Japan skyrocketing to the top tier.

By 2010, those hot Japanese companies faded. Just four from 1970′s list made the 2010 cut. Just four! None do now. What happened? Innovation!

Many formerly dominant Goliaths from 1970′s list got decimated – think of Kodak KODK-N, Sears and XeroxXRX-Q. Poof! Others, such as DuPont, General Motors Co. GM-N, IBM

IBM-N +2.23%increase

and U.S. SteelX-Nshrank to second- or third-tier status. New entrepreneurial entrants ate their lunches – no government fixes required.

Minicomputer firms toppled IBM. Personal computer makers toppled minicomputer companies. Smartphones decimated Kodak. Amazon and Walmart toppled Sears. Everyone toppled Xerox. Globally, former tech kings such as Japan’s calcified.

It never ends. Consider today’s top 20 global companies: Only five adorned 2010′s list. In just 14 years, 15 newbies reached the top 20! Only two of today’s top 20 were on 1990′s list. Creative destruction reigns!

Yes, the process causes business failures, threatening jobs and spurring angst. But long term, failures benefit us all by freeing capital. Creative destruction allows dynamic upstarts to provide world-bettering offerings, create better jobs and more. Failures provide vital information – showing what works versus what needs improvement. Governments barring or inducing creative destruction muddles those key messages.

Consider Japan and its infamous zombie companies, which can no longer lead, yet they still siphon capital from challengers, effectively subsidized by regulation, banks and cross-shareholders. Many zombie companies would be long dead without such support and artificially low interest rates.

Some people cheer Japan’s stable employment. But think bigger: Japan’s dearth of creative destruction created a decades-long malaise. The country’s gross domestic product grew just 0.8 per cent annualized from 1994 to 2023, versus 2.4 per cent for the United States and 2.3 per cent for Canada.

It also underpinned the puny 152 per cent return for Japanese stocks in yen over that stretch. The 924 per cent in Canadian dollars for the Toronto Stock Exchange, tilted to financials and energy, beats that. The S&P 500 Index′s 1,694 per cent boom in U.S. dollars crushes Japan! Notably, government protections didn’t prevent Japan’s strong presence in 1990′s top 20 list from fading.

Governmental interference also often creates unintended consequences. Consider the EU’s many and varied new regulations, lawsuits, fines and attempts to hobble Big Tech for alleged excesses. The latest – EU regulators fining AppleAAPL-Q up to 10 per cent of its global revenue for its App Store’s supposed non-compliance with Europe’s Digital Markets Act – is just one among countless examples over recent decades.

The effects? Europe’s tech sector is tiny. Only three of the world’s 50 largest tech or tech-like firms are eurozone-based, and just three are Japanese. People should decry the lost competitiveness as old-line European and Japanese sectors lag. Meanwhile, America has 35 of tech’s Big 50.

Some proponents now laud Canada’s digital services tax on foreign Big Tech firms – mostly impacting U.S. behemoths such as Alphabet Inc. GOOGL-Qand Meta Platforms Inc. META-Q Maybe you do, too! Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland positively compares it to similar moves in Europe.

But I have shown you the unforeseen consequences of European regulations. Do you really want that here? Today, Canada’s biggest tech company, Shopify Inc.,

SHOP-T +4.64%increase

floats near the bottom of the tech Big 50 list. More regulation won’t help.

No, I don’t urge some no-regulation Wild West. Governments should enforce property rights, truth in advertising and safety rules, which are crucial to investor confidence and risk-taking. But in regulating market dominance, creative destruction works best. Embrace it and thrive.

9644b0f6b9,Forbes,"Sports Psychology Helps Female Athletes Reach Peak Performance, Compete, And Win - Forbes","The success of United States female athletes in the Paris 2024 Olympics was remarkable, winning 67 of the 126 total medals (with one still in question) and 26 of the 40 total gold medals. Their achievements were the highlight of the first gender equal Olympics.

Their talent, life-long dedication and sacrifice are inspirational. Yet, it’s important to recognize that it takes both physical and psychological strength to be a champion. The psychological makeup of an athlete, male or female, is most likely as important in determining that individual’s ability to persevere and perform than physical traits.

Female athletes face unique challenges based on their gender. Much like high potential female executives, they encounter a ‘double double’ standard; a mixed message of the expectation of being intense, aggressive, dedicated, single-minded, and at the same time, warm and welcoming, which adds to their stress and anxiety.

My recent conversation with clinical psychologist Dr. Joshua Klapow, focused on the challenges many female athletes face both physically and psychologically. Klapow’s training as a clinical psychologist is critical to helping female athletes reach peak performance and thrive in a highly competitive environment.

When the larger social context and prevailing social views are pervasive and when they’re ignored, athletic performance and overall development is often compromised, leading to a significantly higher rate of mental health challenges for elite athletes than the general population.

Klapow emphasizes that all sports performance work should integrate the broader psychological and social challenges athletes face. The social pressures of being an athlete permeate deeper than game execution. For both female and male athletes, optimizing sports performance often means learning to navigate broader psychological challenges.

Challenges for female athletes

Female athletes must meet the expectations of achieving the same peak performance level as a male athlete, be as regimented, obsessive and dedicated, sacrifice as much, and navigate the societal expectations for femininity, accommodations, compromise, emotional insight, and empathy.

These expectations for women, along with the pressure to succeed in highly competitive environments, can potentially lead to an increase in anxiety and depression.

With the presence of NIL (Name, Image Likeness), the stakes for female athletes today are astronomical. No longer is the emphasis solely on sports achievement or scholarship attainment. At the high school and collegiate level, athletes are positioned to receive significant financial compensation based on their marketability. Media presence and business savvy are now a much more prominent consideration for elite athletes. Klapow emphasizes that is especially true for female athletes, who must navigate issues around body image, societal expectations of beauty and attractiveness, and pressures to present as brand ambassadors and athletes. The psychological pressures to excel in sports, media image and business are what Klapow helps athletes navigate as much as the pressure to perform in sports alone.

We witnessed how an athlete’s physiological functioning can combine with strong emotions that sabotage the ability to perform with Simone Biles’s withdrawal from the 2020 Toyko Olympics. Her public description of how her body was responding and the admission of needing help to overcome her personal psychological barriers has opened the door to honest conversations about the pressure female athletes face and the importance of sports psychology and mental health interventions.

Klapow cites an example of twin beach volleyball teammates playing for one of the top Universities in the country, where national championships were an expectation. The twin sisters, two of the most gifted physical athletes in the sport, needed to always hit their highest potential and beyond. Despite working tirelessly to optimize their physical performance, it was the non-physical factors including expectations, emotional regulation, anticipation of emotional response and body language on and off the sand that created challenges. When the twins decided to intentionally focus on mindset, as a routine part of their training, they developed a set of cognitive and emotional tools that helped them navigate some of the most high-pressure sports situations imaginable, a set of skills that will extend far beyond their athletic careers.

The Keys to Sports Performance Optimization

Managing Emotions

According to the Association of Applied Sports Psychology, “There is no construct of human psychology and functioning more prevalent in sport than emotion. Mood, emotions, and general affect can influence every movement in every sport.” Klapow adds, “When emotions dictate an athlete’s reasoning, they frequently misjudge the needed actions to successfully navigate a challenge.”

When pressure is high, emotions become front and center. They become the most prominent part of one’s consciousness. The internal dialog of “I feel (insert emotion), therefore this is why this is happening to me” is often a fallacy, according to Klapow. He added that emotional intensity doesn’t equal better outcomes. “Relaxing and dialing back intensity to allow the body and mind to leverage the skills an athlete has already developed is what opens the door for peak performance. When intensity is dialed up and back to the challenge of the situation, performance is optimized.”

Going Beyond Compartmentalization

Compartmentalization is a defense mechanism in which people mentally separate conflicting thoughts, emotions, or experiences to avoid the discomfort of contradiction.

Athletes often rely on the defense mechanism of compartmentalization to perform under pressure, though it is a short term and often failed approach. However, not acknowledging worries, fears, and insecurities while denying their existence creates anxiety that keeps the mind from performing optimally.

“Our thoughts are always present and when we try to push them out as a primary source of navigating a high-pressure situation, they often push back harder and become more prominent. Deny your truth and it will emerge in your stress and lack of optimal physiological responses. Call them out and name them, then you can move forward,” Klapow explained.

Calling out the challenges, the doubts, and the insecurities that every athlete experiences but are often labeled as taboo to discuss, changes how they impact the athlete. Klapow explains “These aversive experiences turn into learning opportunities for managing emotions.”. He adds, “Learning how to manage the anxiety and distress associated with athletic challenge (vs pushing it away) allow athletes to perform well under any situation, not just situations where all the stars align, and they are feeling optimal.”

Managing Expectations

Athletes often believe that they must perform at their best to succeed. However, setting “best” as the only acceptable outcome is an irrational belief system because there is a distinction between best effort and best performance.

Klapow shared with me. “When we set ‘best’ as the criteria, we often fall short because our best performances are rare (otherwise they wouldn’t be the best). An athlete expects their efforts will produce good and great can rely on those to win. Expecting your best performance versus your best effort sets you up for frustration and failure. An athlete who expects ‘the best’ will often fall short.”

Every athlete at the highest levels will lose and fail. But the athlete who accepts that failure is ever present and is part of the equation of excellence is an athlete who moves towards winning versus running away from losing.

Klapow stresses that “learning to lean into emotions, separate them from the situation, trust and rely on skill building, and accepting that failure is a part of life allows people to tap into their true potential in every aspect of life.”

Every athlete who wants to perform at their best needs equal parts physical skills and psychological skills. And that is not a gender specific requirement. Yet, beyond the normal physical and psychological challenges that athletes face, female athletes have a unique set of challenges due to their gender. The double double standard for women, seen across the board from sports to business, contributes to additional stress and anxiety and needs to be addressed for them to reach their peak performance. Klapow notes “any athlete who is dedicated to performing to their physical peak must be equally dedicated to developing a peak mindset. The best of the best, the highest performing athletes are ones who see this, train accordingly, and ultimately reap the benefits of their efforts.”","A female athlete with the name 'THOMAS' on her bib is in the center of the frame, celebrating, with her arms raised and mouth open in a yell.

cf6099ef46,The Washington Post,Biden campaign gave questions to radio hosts before interviews - The Washington Post,"Two radio hosts said Saturday they were supplied questions from aides to President Biden before separate interviews with him this week, a move that a campaign spokeswoman defended as routine.

“It’s not at all an uncommon practice for interviewees to share topics they would prefer,” Biden campaign spokeswoman Lauren Hitt said in a statement. She added that agreeing on topics in advance was not a prerequisite of the interview.

The acknowledgment by Biden’s campaign comes as it has been criticized for heavily controlling his public events to minimize potential gaffes during unscripted appearances.

During a 90-minute debate on June 27, the 81-year-old Democrat appeared tired and confused, and at times he delivered rambling answers. His presumptive Republican opponent, 78-year-old former president Donald Trump, unleashed a flurry of falsehoods during the debate, which CNN hosted. The parties decided in advance not to have their moderators fact-check in real time.

Throughout his three campaigns since 2016, Trump has spread inaccurate statements on a wide range of issues. Still, Biden’s performance on the debate stage has come into particular focus this week after several Democrats, liberal media voices and donors called on him to drop out of the race, or risk losing not just the White House but also control of both houses of Congress.

As part of a coordinated pushback, the White House press secretary announced on Wednesday that Biden had recorded two radio interviews that would air the following morning: one with Earl Ingram, whose show is broadcast across Wisconsin, and another with Andrea Lawful-Sanders on WURD’s “The Source” in Philadelphia.

Both radio hosts appeared on CNN on Saturday, where host Victor Blackwell said the interviews featured questions that were eerily similar. “Were those questions given to you by the White House, or the campaign, or did you have to submit questions ahead of this interview?” Blackwell asked Lawful-Sanders.

“The questions were sent to me for approval. I approved of them,” she said.

Seeking confirmation, Blackwell followed up and asked: “So the White House sent the questions to you ahead of the interview?” Lawful-Sanders replied, “Yes. I got several questions, eight of them. And the four that were chosen were the ones that I approved.” Campaign aides said they sent the proposed questions, not officials from the White House.

Two people familiar with the Biden booking operation said the campaign will not continue the practice of offering “suggested questions.”

Trump’s campaign has made similar moves. Last month, Trump’s campaign abruptly canceled an interview with a local reporter in Virginia after asking the reporter what questions he planned to ask, 13News Now reported.

During the CNN interview, Lawful-Sanders said her audience is primarily focused on the policy differences between Biden and Trump.

Ingram was not asked about the questions he had asked Biden, but the radio host later told ABC News, “Yes, I was given some questions for Biden.” Ingram said he was given five questions and asked Biden four of them, according to the outlet. “I didn’t get a chance to ask him all the things I wanted to ask,” he said. An email sent to Ingram on Saturday afternoon was not immediately returned.

Hitt, the campaign spokeswoman, said in the statement that the questions “were relevant to news of the day — the president was asked about this debate performance as well as what he’d delivered for black Americans. We do not condition interviews on acceptance of these questions, and hosts are always free to ask the questions they think will best inform their listeners.”

She also said that Biden has answered various questions from the media after returning from Wisconsin as well as the interview with George Stephanopoulos that was shown on ABC. “Americans have had several opportunities to see him unscripted since the debate,” Hitt said.

Later on Saturday, Lawful-Sanders sent a statement defending her interview and how questions were negotiated in advance.

“When I was asked to do this interview it was most important to me to have the voices of the Black people heard. I never once felt pressured to ask certain questions,” Lawful-Sanders said. “I chose questions that were most important to the black and brown communities we serve in … Philadelphia. Those questions proved to be exactly what black and brown communities desired.”","A man in a suit stands in front of a backdrop of American flags, holding a sign that reads 'BIDEN HARRIS'.

3c9b54bae6,Financial Times,‘Spaghetti cannon’ filings for 25 hot-trend ETFs prompt concerns - Financial Times,"A US exchange traded fund issuer may have hit “peak 2024” with plans to launch 25 ETFs that would combine two of the hottest current trends: leveraged exposure and option-selling covered calls.

New York-based GraniteShares has filed to launch a family of “YieldBoost” ETFs, many of them based on single stocks, that would sell put options on leveraged ETFs — again many single-stock — issued by rival providers.

The ETFs would potentially benefit from significant option-writing premium income, but would combine a capped capital return with an uncapped downside risk from the underlying leveraged exposure.

“I was shocked by the filing,” said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research, North America at Morningstar, likening it to a “spaghetti cannon”.

“Product development has gone down the path of throwing as much spaghetti at the wall as possible, then seeing what sticks,” Armour added.

“Wow, this is peak 2024,” added Elisabeth Kashner, director of global fund analytics at FactSet.

GraniteShares’ proposed ETFs would invest in a range of single assets, from individual stocks, such as each of the Magnificent Seven, to bitcoin, gold, volatility and a selection of stocks indices and sectors.

They would then sell put options on ETFs leveraged between 1.5 and 3 times issued by providers such as Direxion and ProShares. The collateral would be primarily invested in fixed-income instruments.

The maximum gain would be the premium income earned from selling the options, plus “a limited amount of upside appreciation” up to the option’s strike price — assuming the underlying ETF rises in price to this level.

However, investors would be fully exposed to any loss suffered by the underlying ETF — which could easily be chunky given its leveraged nature — only cushioned by the premium income, which is banked whatever happens.

As such, the proposed YieldBoost ETFs tap into two of the hottest trends in the US ETF market.

Option-selling covered call ETFs have boomed in recent years, as epitomised by JPMorgan’s wildly popular Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI), which has surged to $33.6bn in assets, rendering it the world’s most popular active ETF.

US-listed ETFs classified as “derivative income” by Morningstar Direct, which includes most covered call vehicles, hit a record $70.7bn in assets at the end of April, up from just $3bn at the end of 2020.

Leveraged and inverse ETFs have also attracted more attention, even if their growth has not been as vertiginous, with total assets rising from $54.4bn at the end of 2020 to $94.9bn in April, according to Morningstar.

“Covered call ETFs have been one of the most popular trends in the past year, while single stock leverage ETFs have been some of the better-performing products in the same period,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, a consultancy, “so it’s not surprising that an asset manager wants to combine these in one product.”

In particular, Rosenbluth alluded to the success of NVDL, GraniteShares’ ETF offering 2x daily exposure to chipmaker Nvidia, which has returned 474 per cent since inception in December 2022 and currently holds $2.6bn.

“Preying on the gambling mentality of investors paid off in a big way for GraniteShares with its leveraged single stock ETFs — most of which have struggled but the success of its 2x leveraged Nvidia ETF has earned it a solid payday,” said Armour.

“That success footed the bill for the latest onslaught of YieldBoost ETFs.”

Will Rhind, chief executive of GraniteShares, said “we have a customer base that is crying out for income”.

“First and foremost this is an income product. It’s really an extension of some of the other income strategies that we have seen in the market over the past couple of years, from broad indices to single stocks.

“It’s a very popular category because it has been able to deliver a yield that is not available from either traditional fixed income or dividend-paying stocks.”

The inherently volatile nature of the underlying ETFs means these YieldBoost might be able to generate more option income than other covered call strategies, though their structure also increases the probability of a significant fall in the price of the underlying asset.

“Theoretically, the more volatility you have the more income you should be able to generate,” Rhind said. “There is plenty of demand for this.”

FactSet’s Kashner, a former options trader, though, was unconvinced by the investment rationale for the YieldBoost ETFs.

“The building block is geared exposure and most of the time investors who go into geared exposure are doing so because they believe the underlying is going up and they want more up,” she said.

“I can’t understand the investment rationale behind this: ‘I think Meta is going to the moon but not too far to the moon’? You are only getting some of the up and you are giving up the dividends.”

“What percentage of the investors will understand how these funds function and what the potential costs and benefits are?” Kashner asked, adding that with other covered call strategies such as JEPI “the number of investors who have put their money in it may not correspond to the number of investors who understand it”.

Armour was more forthright still. “Investors in these ETFs may be shocked that these high-risk strategies come with limited upside, most of the downside, and lots of tax-inefficient income. Investors are best steering clear of them,” he said.

If the US Securities and Exchange Commission does not object to the filings, the ETFs could launch on August 7. Rhind said he expected fees to be in line with those for similar covered call ETFs, at about 70-100 basis points.","A man in a suit stands in front of multiple computer screens displaying financial data, with the words 'YORK STOCK EXCHANGE' visible in the background.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA41B8730>,2024-06-05 04:00:02.904000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/b70541d5-a96e-47ad-ba31-a066a0699783,['Business and Finance' 'Other'],[0.95 0.75],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/3c9b54bae6.png
19e747c561,Newsweek,Careers Expert on Why You Should Ask Interviewers 'Behavioral Questions' - Newsweek,"In a job market overflowing with skill and talent, standing out in an interview is a tough gig for many job seekers.

Former recruiter, Mike Peditto, wants to change that by encouraging candidates to ask bolder questions during job interviews. These questions, which he dub ""behavioral,"" are designed to help hopeful employees figure out whether the company they are applying to would be the right fit for them. His insights, borne of over a decade of hiring experience, aim to empower candidates to gain a deeper understanding of potential employers and showcase their own preparedness and strategic thinking.

""I think a lot of people view asking questions at the end of an interview as this step they HAVE to do, but in reality, it should be the part you are most excited about,"" Peditto told Newsweek. ""It should be something that helps you determine if this is the right role for you.""

After an unexpected layoff at the peak of his career, and a subsequent redundancy shortly after, Peditto began posting his advice online. He never expected to become the internet's go-to guy for hiring advice and interview tips, but he is enjoying this new lease of life.

""I accidentally seemed to become both the recruiting and job-seeking face of a terrible job market on social media,"" he said. ""In less than one year, I gained 200,000 followers on social media and built both a professional network and a community for frustrated job seekers and struggling recruiters to come together.""

His focus is now on empowering viewers to ask the right, most ""beneficial, questions during their allocated interview time. Peditto showed his followers how they could start to ask interviewers behavioral-based questions in a video from July 28, which has since been liked more than 76,000 times. He provided examples such as, ""Can you tell me about a time you helped someone on your team progress in their career?"" and ""Can you share an experience where you had to manage a dispute between two co-workers and the role you played in resolving it?""

The former recruiter emphasized the importance of these questions for learning about company culture and management style, urging candidates to go beyond the usual, superficial inquiries that are often thrown about in panic at the end of interviews.

""The reason I made this video is because I don't think enough candidates really put time and energy into the questions they ask on a job interview,"" he said. ""As someone who conducts interviews constantly, I almost always hear the same things which are generally very surface level, or are things I have already talked about and make me feel like you weren't really listening.""

Peditto believes that behavioral-based questions are not only intuitive but also beneficial for fostering deeper conversations.

He added: ""Behavioral-based questions are the easiest way to ask for very specific information, and allow the person interviewing you to think rather than just telling you the same answers to the same questions they always give. This often leads to a better conversation and a better idea about the role.""

The video, while well-intentioned and mostly well-received has welcomed a number of critical comments.

""'These are the questions that will…' Get you a rejection email,"" one viewer said.

Another added: ""People don't do this. I have done it in my last two interviews and got the job at both.""

""I suspect that the hiring manager would be unable to answer many of those questions.""

The careers expert acknowledges that his advice may not universally apply to every job or interviewer, but that on the whole, it is worth taking into consideration.

""I'm not shocked by the huge split among viewers on if this is a good idea or not,"" he said. ""It's really important for me to stress that there is no universal best way to get a job.

""Doing something like this will not work at every role; there will be managers who don't want to answer them, but I do think people will be more open to them than jobseekers think.""

He believes that candidates must tailor their approach and be thoughtful about their interview strategies to stand out positively in an increasingly competitive market.

""A lot of the pushback is from people saying this is only a good idea if the job market isn't bad, but I think it is a good idea because the job market is bad,"" he said. ""The idea is to stand out above a very crowded field.

""I think too many people interview to not lose the job rather than to try to get the job and that is not working for them.""

Peditto aims to virtually support candidates in taking on a more active and engaged role in their interviews, seeing them as opportunities for mutual assessment rather than one-sided evaluations.

He added: ""It's impossible to point at any one thing and say this is what got you the job or what lost you the job, but I think trying to demonstrate you are different and have really put thought into where you work and what questions you want to ask about that job is a good strategy.""","A man in a blue t-shirt with the text 'Resumes & Cover Letters, Networking & LinkedIn, Follow up & Ghosting' stands in a room with a bookshelf and a window in the background.",<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BA25B4A00>,2024-08-18 16:00:01+00:00,https://www.newsweek.com,https://www.newsweek.com/careers-expert-ask-behavioral-questions-interview-1940421,['Business and Finance' 'Other'],[0.8 0.5],Unlikely,Likely,sample_review/images/19e747c561.png
51f9eb0587,CBS News,Detroit Pistons announce J.B. Bickerstaff as new head coach - CBS News,"(CBS DETROIT) - The Detroit Pistons announced J.B. Bickerstaff as their new head coach on Wednesday.

Bickerstaff replaces former head coach Monty Williams, who was fired after one season with the Pistons. He joins Trajan Langdon, the new president of basketball operations, as Detroit works to reshape its team following a disappointing season.

""I'm pleased to have J.B. joining our franchise and commend our front office team on leading an extensive search. This is a pivotal time, and we need a leader who can immediately instill a culture of growth, development and inspiration,"" Pistons owner Tom Gores said in a statement. ""After spending time with J.B., it's clear he is a passionate teacher with a competitive spirit who knows what it takes to win in today's NBA. He's also a strong communicator, which provides great synergy with Trajan and the front office team we have assembled. He will be an outstanding partner in helping out players maximize their potential and complete consistently.""

Bickerstaff worked as the Cleveland Cavaliers' associate head coach for the 2019-2020 season before he was promoted to head coach in February 2020. The Cavaliers fired him in May 2024. Under his leadership, Cleveland reached the playoffs in 2023 and 2024, also advancing to the Eastern Conference semifinals for the first time since 2018.

Prior to Cleveland, he was associate head coach for the Memphis Grizzlies during the 2016-2017 season and then took over as head coach from 2017 to 2019. He also worked for the Houston Rockets and Minnesota Timberwolves. He started his coaching career in 2004 as an assistant with the Charlotte Bobcats (now the Hornets), making him the youngest assistant coach in the NBA at 24 years old.

""Detroit has a great basketball history and I look forward to the opportunity to join Trajan in building a product on the floor that everyone can be proud of,"" Bickerstaff said in a statement. ""As Trajan and Tom expressed their collective goals, it aligns with how I coach and how I look to develop players and drive results.

21b4dfb8cc,The Guardian US,The evolution of Tim Walz: from high school teacher to VP nominee | US elections 2024 - The Guardian US,"Tim Walz must be having the wildest month of his life.

After the Minnesota governor was announced as Kamala Harris’s pick for running mate, the progressive congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and independent senator Joe Manchin both put out statements praising him, an indication of his appeal across Democratic constituencies.

“Dems in disconcerting levels of array,” Ocasio-Cortez joked on X.

In the week since his name catapulted from relative obscurity – Walz flew up the shortlist of second-in-command possibles in a matter of two weeks, buoyed by clips of his TV appearances and memes about his dadliness – camo caps with orange writing have flown off the campaign merch shelves, a nod to Walz’s dressed-down midwestern attire.

But beyond the appearances, his record in politics shows an evolution – a shift from a moderate Democrat winning over a Republican-leaning district to a governor who delivered a laundry list of progressive policy wins that has his critics fuming.

Is he a progressive darling? Is he a moderate in progressive clothing? A centrist? Is this a bait-and-switch?

Well, he’s Tim Walz.

When you talk to people who know Walz, they all call him real, genuine, authentic, an everyman. There’s no reason to believe he’s putting on an act.

But his way of selling policies is also calculated – a sign of a man who’s spent his life working to persuade people, from high school students tuned out in class to voters in a high-stakes presidential election. Beneath his “aw, shucks” demeanor is a skilled political operator.

He’s knowingly tapped into a sort of universalism, selling Democrats’ ideas with broad popular appeal, said Larry Jacobs, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota.

“His thinking is very much around: how is it that we can present our policies and our political agenda as benefiting everyone?” Jacobs said.

The pre-politics life

Walz was born in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, in 1964, then lived in a couple of other small Nebraska towns, ultimately graduating in a class of 25 students from a high school in Butte. He enlisted in the army national guard at age 17, serving 24 years before retiring.

His father died when he was 19. He has said his family relied on social security survivor benefits to stay afloat. Walz subsequently moved around, taking some classes in Houston, Texas, then building tanning beds in Arkansas.

He ended up back in Nebraska at Chadron State College, graduating with a bachelor’s degree in 1989. He first taught abroad, in China, for a year after college, then returned to Nebraska to teach locally.

Walz met his wife, Gwen, also a teacher, and they moved to Mankato, Minnesota, a mid-size town south-west of Minneapolis. They now have two children, Hope and Gus, and have shared how they used in-vitro fertilization to bring them into the world.

He was a part of the football coaching staff that led the school to a state championship in 1999. His status as a coach played heavily in Harris’s introduction of him in Philadelphia on Tuesday.

And he was the faculty adviser for a new chapter of the school’s gay-straight alliance, at a time when LGBTQ+ issues were not embraced by his own political party, a nod to his progressive bona fides.

His start in politics

Walz has said an experience taking students to see a George W Bush rally, where his students were turned away because organizers believed they were Democrats, led him to seek public office.

He first ran for Congress in Minnesota’s Republican-leaning first congressional district in 2006, beating the Republican incumbent in an upset. One of his first radio ads highlights the hearing loss he experienced from using heavy artillery in the national guard and how the medical services he accessed helped him to hear his young daughter singing in the morning.

“I am running for Congress because I believe we as a country have a moral obligation to ensure that every father can hear his daughter sing – that every citizen receives the best care our medical community has to offer,” he says in the ad.

His record in Congress proved moderate. He often co-sponsored bills with Republicans and was one of the few Democrats to vote to hold the then attorney general Eric Holder in contempt of Congress in 2012.

A gun owner and hunter, Walz previously received endorsements and donations from the National Rifle Association and had an A rating from the group, which plummeted to an F rating after he gave the group’s donations to charity and signed gun control measures as governor. He has said mass shootings, like those in Las Vegas and at a high school in Parkland, Florida, showed him the need for greater restrictions.

Walz supported the Affordable Care Act and the Dream Act, and he voted in favor of repealing the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” anti-gay policy.

“He’s got deep core convictions, but he’s driven by the facts and he’s driven by what he hears from the people that he’s representing,” said Josh Syrjamaki, who was Walz’s chief of staff in the district from 2007 until he became governor in 2019.

Syrjamaki recalled tense town hall meetings during the Tea Party days where Walz would get hammered by conservatives upset with his votes. He would listen to their appeals and try to find common ground.

He remembers Walz having to defend his votes on issues such as the Affordable Care Act, which was“pretty unpopular in very conservative parts of the country”.

In a 2014 debate with his Republican challenger, Walz used a line he’s brought up now – that neighborliness is not socialism – and said party affiliation didn’t prevent him from working with someone or from calling someone out.

“When I disagree with them, I don’t disagree because they’re Republican or Democrat, I disagree when they’re wrong,” Walz said at the time.

He ran for governor in 2018. Walz won the Democratic primary and then the general election that year – he has never lost a race.

He did not receive the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor party’s endorsement – that went to Erin Murphy, now the majority leader in the state senate, who ran on a “politics of joy” message that looks a lot like the joy Walz is harnessing on the campaign trail now. The idea is borrowed from another Minnesotan, former vice-president Hubert Humphrey.

Murphy said she started getting texts from people after Harris took over the ticket, saying the vice-president has the politics of joy, too. Walz, whom she has worked closely with, has the same “happy warrior” energy.

“He really does care about people. I don’t know how we do politics if we don’t care about people, but, you know, it shines through in him,” Murphy said.

A progressive wishlist

Walz’s first term as governor required working with a divided legislature, limiting what Democrats could do. But then, in 2022, Democrats won both chambers of the legislature and Walz won re-election, giving the party a trifecta.

Democrats took the ball and ran with it.

The 2023 legislative session made national headlines. Democrats in Minnesota put up posters listing their top priorities – protecting reproductive rights, paid family and medical leave, driver’s licenses for undocumented people, universal school meals, clean energy, childcare assistance, gun control measures, felony voting rights restoration, a ban on conversion therapy. They checked them all off, with Walz’s signature on each one.

The session was branded the “Minnesota miracle”.

“He has really got a record now as a governor that is kind of a progressive dream list,” said Amy Koch, a former Republican majority leader.

In the years before the 2023 session, progressive organizers worked to build support among voters for these kinds of policies, said JaNaé Bates, the co-director of Faith in Minnesota, an advocacy group. The group endorsed Murphy in the 2018 Democratic primary, but its work in that race “moved the Overton window for all of the candidates”.

“It took us 10 years to build the kind of mandate that was then shovel-ready once we got the trifecta in 2022,” Bates said.

Melissa Hortman, the speaker of the Minnesota house, said she, the senate majority leader and Walz had gotten together the Friday after the 2022 election and went through their to-do lists, which were “very aligned”.

“We were a team right from the get-go,” she said. “There was none of that kind of difficult stuff behind the scenes of like, who’s going to get credit? We just were a team. We went out there and did it together.”

Walz championed some items heavily from the start, like paid family leave. He also pushed for the child tax credit and clean energy mandate.

Universal school meals, in particular, have emerged as a battle line in this election. Walz has defended them in simple terms: kids need to eat so they can learn. Some Republicans, including those who wrote Project 2025, the rightwing manifesto for a potential second Trump term, refer to school meals as an entitlement program that should be curtailed.

Sydney Jordan, a state representative who sponsored the universal school meals bill in the house, said Walz initially got on board with a previous measure against school lunch debt shaming, which evolved into universal school meals. She wears a button that says “feed the kids”.

Democrats in the legislature say Walz’s guiding principle is to use policy to help as many people as possible. And if that falls into the progressive camp, so be it. Some of the policies, like paid family leave, are broadly popular, noted Jamie Long, a Democratic state representative.

“Governor Walz has a record that I think progressives can be proud of, but I think one of the reasons why he is such a good fit for the ticket is that he’s able to communicate the policies that we were able to achieve in Minnesota in a way that everyday people can understand, and in a way that I think speaks across political difference and doesn’t alienate folks,” Long said.

Walz might not call himself a progressive directly, but he wouldn’t bristle if you called him one, his colleagues say. And he staunchly defends every policy he has signed.

“You cannot call him anything else after what he just did,” Jacobs, the professor, said of the progressive label. The leading edge of his party is progressive, so he works with them and finds policies that can win enough votes to pass and then help sell the party to voters again at election time.

But Republican lawmakers have felt shut out of the process. Lisa Demuth, the minority leader in the state house, said she liked Walz’s idea of “One Minnesota”, of unity, that he ran on in 2018. The slogan appears on a specialty license plate on his classic International Scout vehicle.

“There was really no appetite of the Democrats to have to work with Republicans at all,” she said. There are only a handful of bipartisan bills from recent sessions, including one for nursing home support.

“They had the votes. They had partisan priorities, they had full control of the entire state. And they were very clear in saying, ‘We’re going to push through what our priorities have been, and we’re going to get them done.’”

Battle lines drawn

Republicans have quickly tried to paint Walz as radical after Harris’s announcement.

“She picked a radical left man that is, he has positions that are not even possible to believe that they exist,” the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, said in a press conference this week. “He is going for things that nobody has even heard of. Heavy into the transgender world. Heavy into lots of different worlds.”

Memes have spread calling Walz “Tampon Tim”, a reference to a law he signed that requires schools to carry menstrual products in their restrooms, which some have criticized because boys’ bathrooms may have period products in them as well. He also signed a trans haven law that protects access to gender-affirming care in the state.

Others have attacked his military record, saying he retired from the service rather than go to Iraq with his national guard unit and that he was inflating his rank, given he did not complete training to be called a command sergeant major at retirement. These claims came up during his gubernatorial runs but are getting increased scrutiny on the national stage. Walz retired before his unit received orders to go to Iraq, though after an indication that the unit might be called up.

And photos of Minneapolis burning after riots followed the murder of George Floyd by police have resurfaced. A report from state senate Republicans criticized Walz and Minneapolis’s mayor for being too slow to respond.

Republicans have also scoffed at the idea that Walz could appeal to rural voters with his lengthy list of progressive policies. He didn’t win his old district in his run for governor.

“I think he doubles down on the criticisms of Harris by the Trump campaign,” Jacobs said. “If you’re arguing that Harris is super liberal, you’ve just got an enormous example of that in Walz.”

Demuth pointed to a comment Walz made in 2017 about electoral maps that show broad swathes of red, which Walz said were made up “mostly of cows and rocks”.

“We are not rocks and cows,” the Republican lawmaker said. “He has not paid attention to greater Minnesota or the rural areas of Minnesota unless it’s been a good campaign strategy for him.”

Vice-presidential picks themselves don’t typically sway many voters, though they can signal how a president would govern and can win some people at the margins. In a very close election, that can matter.

But the pick is a sign that Democrats might try to win voters in places they haven’t in recent years. Some mentioned Walz’s appeal in places like the iron range, the iron-ore mining area in northern Minnesota that was once solid blue and is now trending more red, and hope that can translate to other parts of the Rust belt that Democrats need to win the presidency.

They also think he’ll appeal in the suburbs, where his plainspoken nature will sound familiar to voters in key states like Wisconsin and Michigan.

He looks the part of a suburban or rural midwestern dad, the kind of guy the word “avuncular” was made for. And it’s not a costume – the camo hat, jeans, T-shirt and comfortable shoes are his actual clothes.

“He only wears a suit if he absolutely has to,” Long said. “That’s not an act, that’s just him being Tim and not being willing to craft his image around what people think a governor ought to look like. He’s just who he’s always been.”

But curbing the Democratic losses in some of these areas won’t be easy.

Terry Gjersvik, a farmer who lives in Walz’s old congressional district and ran for office as a Democrat in the rural area in 2018, found Walz “indefatigable” on the campaign trail, bouncing from conversation to conversation with voters. Gjersvik lost his race, as many Democrats in rural areas now do.

“In the rural areas, when you’re a Democrat, you stop the bleeding, especially on the statewide races,” he said.

One Minnesota farmer told the Star Tribune that an electric vehicle law “burns my butt”. Another voter in a St Paul suburb has a sign in his yard that says “MY GOVERNOR IS AN IDIOT”, the New York Times reported. The 2024 election will also test how voters feel about the Minnesota trifecta’s work, with control of the legislature up for grabs.

Jane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic party, said Walz’s “mind your own damn business” retort and his populist policies will endear him throughout the midwest.

“We have a saying out here, and Tim Walz uses this, and he also embodies it, that if it doesn’t bother the cattle, it doesn’t bother me,” she said.","An older man with white hair, wearing a suit, is shown from the chest up, with his hand on his chin, against a dark background with a blue light source.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BA1BB9540>,2024-08-11 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/11/tim-walz-evolution,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/21b4dfb8cc.png
9f97361f17,CBC.ca,Is Fancy Dance the antidote to Killers of the Flower Moon? - CBC.ca,"The new film Fancy Dance starring Lily Gladstone is set on a reservation in Oklahoma, not far from where Killers of the Flower Moon — the other movie she stars in — was set. But the ways each film approached telling Indigenous stories are far from similar.

Angela Sterritt is a journalist and author from the Wilp Wiik'aax of the Gitanmaax community within the Gitxsan Nation on her dad's side and from Bell Island Newfoundland on her maternal side. Marek Tyler is an artist and administrator from Treaty 6 territory and the Onion Lake Cree Nation.

They join host Elamin Abdelmahmoud to talk about how the two films are in conversation with each other, and why it's Lily Gladstone's most important role to date.

We've included some highlights below, edited for length and clarity. For the full discussion, listen and follow Commotion with Elamin Abdelmahmoud on your favourite podcast player.

Elamin: Marek, watching this movie, compared to Killers of the Flower Moon, how can you tell that this one is a film made by an Indigenous filmmaker who grew up on that reservation where it's set?

Marek: I think there's a nuance to Indigenous artwork. It's kind of like if you know, you know. It's the subtleties and the nuance of maybe the set design — maybe you see people who decorate their places with a blanket on the wall, or you'll see a lot of pictures of family all over the place. You saw that nuance in this film. The way that people interacted with each other was nonchalant, and I really loved how internally it felt like community.

But more importantly, for me, this movie gave a perspective that is not my own, and it's really challenging to speak on it. So this was a window for me just to watch, to learn, to listen and to see these matriarchs hold a space that is so powerful, and make decisions, and make sure that their heritage, their culture, their dance, their perspectives, their agency is not being lost. When I think about the nuance between these two movies, that's what I saw: the nuance of how powerful these women are.

Elamin: Angela, this movie deals with issues like missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, the removal of Indigenous children from their homes to be placed with white families, racism in policing. These themes play out in these characters' lives in ways that are not particularly soapbox-y; it is sort of just baked into the reality of these fully-realized characters, who have other aspirations and hopes outside of those contexts. How do you think this movie gets at those truths without feeling exploitative?

Angela: One of the things that I felt throughout the whole movie was this baseline of love, which is so real in our communities. Colonization, the impetus of it was to fracture our families, and you see this throughout the movie. I loved the nuance in the characters. Even the white dad, I was like, ""I know you from the rez. You're the one married to the woman, and you sort of get it,"" right?

I think there was this thing even ten years ago of, ""We need to be so real. We need to show the racism. We need to show the toxic masculinity, because that's the way it is."" But what about our dreams to have ceremony integrated into our lives? What about our dreams of speaking our language fluently, as a 37 year old and a 13 year old? I was like, yes, let's normalize this stuff through film. So that was one of the reasons why I found it so powerful.

Elamin: You said you felt safe when you were watching this movie. Just to give a quick plot recap, the movie is about Jax trying to find her sister Tawi, while trying to take care of her niece Roki. They get into all kinds of trouble. It's essentially a road trip movie for much of the film, and Roki is on her way to a powwow where she's hoping to meet with her mother, who has gone missing. This is not a plot where I would hear that and go, ""One would feel safe watching that."" When you say you felt safe, what are you getting at?

Angela: I think if you put it beside Killers of the Flower Moon — that movie, I felt very unsafe. I was like, why are the Indigenous women positioned as weak, and not very intelligent, and just assimilating so quickly? And these really horrific scenes of violence. One of the things that we loved, the Indigenous women that I watched the film with, is that they didn't show Tawi's body or talk about her death. It was about who she was in her life, which was a complex character.

The ending, I won't give that away, but we all loved that, too. You don't get to see the horrors of what transpired after that — and we all know what's probably going to happen. But the whole way I was like, 1,000 per cent this is an Indigenous woman's lens, and I'm protected as I'm watching this, and I'm going to get a lot out of this in terms of being able to watch the film and just be like, ""This is brilliantly made,"" you know?

146e29d8b2,Financial Times,Why EU capitals have ignored von der Leyen’s gender balance request - Financial Times,"Good morning, and welcome back to Europe Express. I hope you had a fantastic summer break.

It’s been an atrocious August for Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, who now knows what it feels like to be invaded. Enjoy this excellent visual explainer on the 10 days that turned the war against Russia. And, as we reveal today, his cunning scheme to swap frozen Russian assets for western investments immobilised by the Kremlin has so far been another major failure.

Today, I explain why the task of picking the next slate of European commissioners has become a fight over gender balance, and my Brussels colleague reports on a debate between member states on deploying troop trainers to Ukraine.

Too many men

We need some more women in here.

Before European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen set off for her summer holiday, she asked EU capitals to submit nominations for new commissioners, requesting both male and female candidates. Very few followed that rule.

Context: The EU’s college of commissioners is made up of 27 officials representing the bloc’s member states who are then endorsed by the European parliament. They have portfolios similar to national ministers — such as the economy, agriculture and trade.

Two posts have been filled: von der Leyen herself, from Germany, as the returning president, and Estonia’s Kaja Kallas, as the bloc’s foreign policy chief.

But for the other 25 roles, only three countries — Croatia, Finland and Sweden — have proposed women (Spain has yet to make Teresa Ribera, its de facto female nominee, official). Sixteen countries have only put forward men, and five have yet to declare their nominees.

Of the male nominees, five get a free pass as returning commissioners: those from France, Hungary, Latvia, the Netherlands and Slovakia. That leaves at least 11 capitals that have simply ignored von der Leyen’s request.

There’s nothing in the EU’s treaties obliging capitals to propose more than one name, or any rule about gender. But for the president, who made the same request five years ago, it’s an early test of her second-term mettle, and the balance of power between Brussels and national capitals ahead of a term set to be dominated by some major battles on policy issues.

Von der Leyen can in theory punish countries that make male-only suggestions by giving their nominees more junior roles in the commission, but at the same time she also needs to keep key capitals and political factions happy.

And the parliament also needs to agree with her commissioners in a majority vote for the entire team after individual hearings set for later this autumn. Many in the 720-strong chamber are already licking their lips at the prospect of playing hardball over some nominees, and giving the incoming commission a bloody nose before it is even formally constituted.

If the proposed slate is egregiously male-dominated, yet more parliamentarians may feel entitled to withhold their endorsement, and send von der Leyen — and national governments — back to the drawing board.

Chart du jour: Defence contractors set to rake in cash

The world’s largest aerospace and defence companies are set to rake in record levels of cash over the next three years as military orders soar, with governments arming up amid geopolitical tensions.

Red line

The EU has explored the possibility of stationing troops from its member states in Ukraine to train Kyiv’s army but has stopped short of recommending such a deployment, writes Paola Tamma.

Context: An EU mission to train Ukrainian personnel mainly in Germany and Poland is coming to an end in November. Ahead of its likely extension, Ukraine had asked that some training happen on its soil, due to a shortage in EU countries of old Soviet equipment.

The European External Action Service, the bloc’s foreign and security arm, said in a report prepared for capitals and first reported by German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, that while “feasible” it was “highly likely” that Russia would perceive this move as a provocation.

Member state officials will discuss the EEAS’s assessment tomorrow, and take a decision before the end of the mission’s existing mandate.

While Baltic states have previously expressed themselves in favour of an idea first raised publicly by French President Emmanuel Macron, a majority of EU countries are wary.

Opponents fear that the risks of escalating tensions with Russia are too high and that it would mean diverting Ukraine’s already scarce air defences from the front lines to protect the training centres, said one EU diplomat.

“The general mood is not in favour,” the diplomat said, adding that the additional value of training troops locally still wasn’t clear.

332a4b72ee,Financial Times,When will UK rental inflation slow down? - Financial Times,"The typical economic misery index is created by adding the unemployment rate to the inflation rate.

For Britain’s renters, this might be more appropriate:

Or this:

Or (Ingerland only, soz) this:

As many (predominantly younger) people whose tenancies are tied to the start of the university term cycle prepare to swallow a fresh jump in prices — or lower their expectations — one question will be on many minds: are rents going to get lower soon?

No. Ok, well, very likely not.

How about this instead: are rent going to stop getting higher quite so quickly soon?

Maybe, says Deutsche Bank’s Sanjay Raja:

There’s reason to be optimistic that rental inflation will start to subside by later in the year.

First, RICS detailed data suggests that tenant demand for properties has died down significantly since the onset of the pandemic. In fact, rental demand dipped into negative territory at the end of last year and remains well below its long-run average. New landlord instructions have also started to show some signs of improvement in recent quarters. While still below normal levels, we could see a pick-up in new instructions by H2-24, absorbing some of the ‘excess demand’ in the market.

Second, demand for buy-to-let properties has picked up. According to the Bank of England’s Credit Conditions survey, lenders have started to up their expectations for buy-to-let mortgages, with H1-24 data looking fairly strong. Forward-looking expectations also point to further increases in demand for buy-to-let mortgages. The Building Society Association reported its 6th largest single quarter increase in investors looking for buy-to-let properties.

Third, multiple property sources point to a slowdown in rental inflation. For one, HomeLet data show that after having peaked at over 11% y-o-y in late 2023, annual price inflation is on the way down, sitting currently closer to 5% y-o-y. Zoopla’s own rental market report suggest that prices are running at 6.6% y-o-y as of June 2024 (after hitting a peak of 16% in Q4-24), but rents for new lets are expected to “rise more slowly this year”. A similar view was echoed by Rightmove which noted that rent inflation hit 6.8% y-o-y, slowing from its peak of 16% in the last couple of years. The ONS’ own public opinion and social trends survey have also pointed to a softening in mortgage/rent increases experienced by households in the last month (July marked the lowest reading we’ve seen going back to Feb-24). And lastly, rent expectations, 3-months ahead, from RICS suggest a tempering in price inflation. From its post-pandemic peaks, rent expectations have slowed from its peak of near +65 to now +38. While not quite back to its pre-pandemic levels, the data points to some disinflation ahead.

(Disinflation — a slowdown in the pace of price increases — is sadly not the same thing as deflation, where prices actually go down.)

The other argument for a normalisation in rent increases is that it would be, well, normal: “rents prices ultimately tend to track headline inflation – with a lag”, notes Raja:

So far, the jump in rental inflation has been linear – and partly driven by methodological changes to how how private rents data are collected. But ultimately, as inflation normalises, private rental inflation will too. In fact, there have only been two periods in the last two decades where private rents CPI tracked above headline CPI (one around 2014-2016 and now). These tend to be anomalies rather than the norm. With the private rents-headline CPI wedge now extending 5.6pp, we’d expect to see a swift correction over the next year or so.

If rental inflation is heading for slow then steady, it’s worth further interrogating the mechanics of why.

Obviously buyers are notionally price-setters in the rental market, but it’s not like buying chocolate or a new laptop: most tenants don’t have a choice between renting or not renting.

In addition, initiating the renting process takes place under circumstances with significant pressure — households often form late (particularly, we’d imagine, around this time of year), flat-hunting can be hugely time-consuming, and the process is rife with information asymmetry.

This puts a lot of power, however much many may protest, in landlords’ hands. If they whip themselves up into a rent-hiking cycle, there is not a lot tenants can do.

Which is great for the Bank of England, whose rate-setters seem to have accepted that renters are a useful conduit for transmitting monetary policy. By hiking interest rates over recent years, they drove up the cost of mortgages, increases which landlords have evidently been able to pass on to renters — roughly a fifth of the population, a fifth that is usually younger and poorer.

Incidentally, here’s the BoE Monetary Policy Committee’s latest view on rent, from the August Monetary Policy Report:

Demand for rental properties continues to cool, although supply remains constrained. Rental price inflation has slowed, and some estate agents are reporting a rise in rental arrears.

As we’ve mentioned in a few pieces now, the structure of the UK’s modern mortgage market — dominated by 5- and 2-year fixed-rate products — effectively bakes lag into the transmission process: costs only go up when it is time for the product to be renewed. Even assuming rates continue to go down from here, that suggests there will be several more years of people having to pay a higher rate when they renew. That would imply a lot more rental inflation is yet to filter through. So, if it isn’t, why not?

Greed, maybe. As we see it, there are three possible paths:

1) Rent increases steady out from here, which would suggest that many landlords simply increased their prices in line with the market before actually experiencing an increase in their own costs. Nice work if you can get it.

2) Rent inflation remains elevated versus inflation and wage growth, which would suggest landlords are continuing to encounter and pass on large mortgage increases as their fixes lapse.

3) The squeeze on renters and supply has been too much, and prices flatline or even fall from here.

We strong suspect 1) is the most likely path, which will suggest a great many landlords opportunistically used the inflationary environment as cover increase their income despite not yet facing mortgage cost increases. That’s an unlovely consideration for renters, but is a lot less concerning than 2) would be. As for 3)… maybe. Probably not. Sorry.

As the UK begins what might well be its slowest-ever cutting cycle, higher rental costs are probably here to stay.",A person in a black shirt is holding a key in one hand and a folder in the other.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6B7F237B50>,2024-08-19 05:00:44.890000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/23ca2108-84ee-49e1-800c-ac69c0f1b1d5,['Business and Finance' 'National'],[0.85 0.75],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/332a4b72ee.png
1504287982,Financial Times,Starbucks’ $113mn man has a China problem - Financial Times,"Starbucks has a Venti-sized problem in China. Having virtually created the mainland coffee shop market over the past 25 years, the Seattle-based coffee group is no longer the only latte in town.

Competition from foreign and local brands is stiff. China’s economy is slowing and consumers are more cautious. The result: despite investing heavily over the past six years to more than double its store count in the country, Starbucks has lost almost half of its market share.

For Brian Niccol, Starbucks’ newly appointed chief executive and $113mn man, figuring out what to do with China — now the company’s second biggest market — could end up being a bigger challenge than fixing the US business.

Niccol is highly regarded for the turnaround at Chipotle, which was plagued by food safety problems when he first joined. But he has limited experience building businesses outside the US. Chipotle is largely a domestic brand. Its physical footprint of about 3,530 outlets is about half the size of Starbucks’ China operations.

Compared with the US, Starbucks’ problems in China have no obvious fixes. In its most recent quarter, revenue at its 7,306 stores there fell 11 per cent to $733.8mn. Like-for-like sales suffered an even steeper 14 per cent decline. Local rivals — namely Luckin Coffee, resurgent after its high profile accounting scandal in 2020 — are undercutting Starbucks on price and convenience. The price war has been brutal for everyone. Even Luckin, which overtook Starbucks as China’s biggest coffee chain last year, reported a 13 per cent drop in net income for the June quarter.

Starbucks sells itself as a premium product in China. But it already has a high level of penetration in the cities with the highest disposable income. To chase the low-end and mid-end of the market that have powered Luckin’s growth, Starbucks will need to expand in third tier cities. That will be costly.

All this makes the case for cutting back capital spending and slowing expansion plans in China (the company had said it wanted to have 9,000 outlets in the country by the end of 2025). BTIG analyst Peter Saleh reckons Starbucks has invested more than $400mn a year — or 20-25 per cent of the company’s capital spend — to expand in China.

A more radical move would be refranchising the China business, either via a tax-free spin-off or sale to a master franchisee. The move would allow Starbucks to keep some exposure to one of the biggest coffee markets in the world without the capital burden. It would also distance Starbucks from China’s macroeconomics headwinds and political uncertainty.

Taking more drastic action overseas could also buy Niccol time to help Starbucks get its buzz back at home.",A man in a beige suit stands in front of a white background with a framed map.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BCAEB7580>,2024-08-17 04:00:55.802000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/0d43b13b-686b-47c8-b0ab-95726ce7b186,['Business and Finance' 'International' 'National'],[0.9 0.8 0.5],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/1504287982.png
cbf3f8f64c,ABC News,New Corvette ZR1 revealed: Inside the car's 'mind-blowing' specs - ABC News,"""Mind-bending."" ""Cutting edge."" ""Next level.""

Meet the 2025 Corvette ZR1.

The camouflage was finally removed to reveal the latest Corvette Thursday night at a private event in Miami, Florida. The ZR1 now holds the title for the ""fastest and most powerful"" Vette ever produced.

Chevrolet's engineers pushed the boundaries of engine architecture with the ZR1, squeezing 1,064 horsepower and 828 lb-ft of torque from the 5.5-liter twin-turbocharged V8.

""We didn't know what the final [horsepower] number could be until late in the program. Instead of saying we wanted a specific number, we said we will use all available technology, the best possible hardware, state-of-the-art software and controls systems and we'll see what we get,"" Tadge Juechter, Corvette's executive chief engineer, told ABC News. ""What we got is very impressive ... we didn't leave a single pony on the table.""

The engineers earned the bragging rights: They clocked a sub-10-second quarter-mile time on the Corvette ZR1's first launch. Four test drivers even pushed the car past 200 mph on their first laps at the Nürburgring track in Germany. Corvette detractors will have to finally accept that the American sports car continues to post performance stats that are equal to or better than its European rivals.

""No one will be able to question the overwhelming performance of the ZR1,"" Juechter pointed out. ""People will look back 50 years from now and remember the C8 ZR1 as a high-water mark for the industry.""

The ZR1's exterior design is more striking and aggressive than the base Stingray and the optional ZTK package adds a high-downforce rear wing, front dive planes and a tall hood Gurney lip, according to the marque. Head to a local racetrack to burn those Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires: the ZR1 has a top speed of 215 mph. The LT7 V8 is the first twin-turbocharged engine in a factory Corvette.

The available ZTK package even adds a high-downforce rear wing, front dive planes and a tall hood Gurney lip, all of which have been constructed from woven carbon fiber, according to the marque.

Corvette buffs may also appreciate the return of the split window – ""a beloved element from Corvette’s history,"" according to Phil Zak, executive design director at Chevrolet. ""Not only does this element provide function, but we were able to integrate passionate design into the form and do it in a way that paid homage to Corvette's history. ZR1 felt like the right time to bring the split-window back.""

The car's interior received special attention, too: there's unique ZR1 badging found on an interior plaque, the sill plates and steering wheel. A new finishing stitch pattern for the doors is specific to the car.

Customers can choose from a long list of exterior colors, including Competition Yellow, Hysteria Purple, and Sebring Orange.

Production begins in 2025 with pricing details coming later this year. Will more Corvette owners choose the ZR1 over the electrified E-Ray or the raucous Z06 with its naturally aspirated V8 engine? Hard to tell. Juechter, however, argued that the ZR1 won't steal sales from the other Corvette models on the market.

""We are providing our customers an incredible menu of choices at different price points,"" he noted. ""As long as they are happy, they can order, and we will build whatever they want.""",A bright yellow Corvette ZR1 is captured from a side angle on a curved road with a scenic mountainous backdrop.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA3F7EAD0>,2024-07-25 23:31:00+00:00,https://abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/new-corvette-zr1-revealed-inside-cars-mind-blowing/story?id=112269891,['Business and Finance' 'Entertainment'],[0.85 0.75],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/cbf3f8f64c.png
42a0550858,The Globe and Mail,Israel shoots down a missile fired from Yemen hours after a deadly Israeli strike on Houthi rebels - The Globe and Mail,"The Israeli military said it intercepted a missile fired from Yemen early Sunday, hours after Israeli warplanes struck several Houthi targets in the Arabian Peninsula country.

The Israeli air strikes – in response to a deadly Houthi drone strike on Tel Aviv – were the first time Israel is known to have responded to repeated Houthi attacks throughout its nine-month war against Hamas. The burst of violence between the distant enemies has threatened to open a new front as Israel battles a series of Iranian proxies across the region.

The Israeli army late Saturday confirmed the air strikes in the western Yemeni port city of Hodeidah, a Houthi stronghold and crucial entry point for aid and other supplies. It said the strikes, carried out by dozens of aircraft, including U.S.-made F-15 and F-35 warplanes, were a response to hundreds of Houthi attacks.

The Health Ministry in Yemen said the Israeli strikes killed six people and wounded 83 others, many with severe burns from a major fire. Another three people were missing, the ministry said in a statement shared by the Houthi-run al-Masirah TV.

Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam posted on X that the “blatant Israeli aggression” targeted fuel storage facilities and the province’s power station.

“The Israeli enemy picked those targets specifically as part of their targeting of the Yemeni economy,” said Abdul-Malek al-Houthi, leader of the rebels.

The Israeli military said that the surface-to-surface missile fired Sunday was intercepted before reaching Israeli territory.

Israel, along with the U.S., the U.K. and other Western allies with forces in the region, have intercepted almost all of the Houthi missiles and drones. But early Friday, a Houthi drone penetrated Israel’s air defences and crashed into Tel Aviv, Israel’s commercial and cultural capital, killing one person.

An Israeli air force official said Sunday that human error accidentally classified the drone as a non-threat as Israel was simultaneously tracking other drones launched from Yemen and approaching Israel from the east.

The Israeli military said Saturday’s strike on Hodeidah, about 1,700 kilometres (more than 1,000 miles) from Israel, was among the most complicated and longest-distance operations by its air force. It said it hit the port because the area is used to deliver Iranian arms to Yemen.

Israel’s Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant, vowed to carry out similar strikes “in any place where it may be required.”

The Houthis are among several Iranian-backed groups to have attacked Israel in solidarity with Hamas since the Oct. 7 attack by the Palestinian militant group triggered the continuing Israeli offensive in Gaza.

In addition to fighting Hamas, the Israeli military has been engaged in daily clashes with the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon. These clashes have raised concerns that the fighting could spill over into a full-blown war with Lebanon and beyond.

Yemen has been engulfed in civil war since 2014, when the Houthis seized much of the north and forced the internationally recognized government to flee from Sanaa. A Saudi-led coalition intervened in support of government forces, and in time the conflict turned into a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

The war has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters.

The Houthis said Israel’s attacks will only make Yemen’s people and armed forces more determined to support Gaza. “There will be impactful strikes,” Mohamed Ali al-Houthi of the Supreme Political Council in Yemen wrote on X.

“All of this won’t stop the Yemeni people or the Yemeni leadership, military and missile forces in targeting the Israeli entities,” said Moatasem Abdel Salah, a Sanaa resident.

Since January, U.S. and U.K. forces have been striking targets in Yemen, in response to the Houthis’ attacks on commercial shipping that the rebels have described as retaliation for Israel’s actions in the war in Gaza. However, many of the ships targeted weren’t linked to Israel.

On Sunday, officials said that the Houthis repeatedly targeted a Liberia-flagged container vessel transiting the Red Sea, the latest assault by the group on the crucial maritime trade route.

The captain of the ship reported attacks from three small Houthi vessels, an uncrewed Houthi aerial vehicle and missile fire off the coast of Mocha, Yemen, resulting in “minor damage” to the ship, the British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations centre said. The Joint Maritime Information Center, a coalition overseen by the U.S. Navy, identified the ship as the Pumba and reported “all crew on board safe.”

Early Sunday, the Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack on the Pumba.

Analysts and Western intelligence services have long accused Iran of arming the Houthis, a claim Tehran denies. The joint force air strikes so far have done little to deter them.

The Houthis have long-range ballistic missiles, smaller cruise missiles and “suicide drones,” all capable of reaching southern Israel, according to weapons experts. The Houthis are open about their arsenal, regularly parading new missiles through the streets of Sanaa.","A missile is seen in the air above a building with a large fire in the background, amidst a cloudy sky and industrial structures.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6B7D99D270>,2024-07-21 14:55:30.310000+00:00,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-israel-shoots-down-missile-fired-from-yemen-after-striking-houthis/,['International' 'Politics'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/42a0550858.png
b9277571fc,CNN,Nvidia is suddenly in trouble - CNN,"Nvidia, the AI chipmaking titan that was briefly the world’s most valuable company, has suddenly found itself in an unfamiliar position: a major rut.

Nvidia (NVDA) had the worst day in the history of the stock market Tuesday, as measured by loss in total market value. Its 9.5% share price decline shaved a stunning $279 billion off the company’s value, far outpacing the previous record of $240 billion set by Meta in 2022.

To put that shocking decline into context, only 27 companies on the planet are worth as much as Nvidia lost in value Tuesday. That $279 billion evaporation is worth more than all the shares of some of America’s biggest companies, including McDonald’s, Chevron and Pepsi.

CEO Jensen Huang, who is Nvidia’s largest individual shareholder (and fifth-largest overall, counting institutional investors like BlackRock) personally lost $10 billion in wealth Tuesday from Nvidia’s sharp tumble.

The company has been in decline since June 18, when it topped $3.3 trillion in value — the highest for any public company. As the US economy begins to show some signs of stress, investors have grown skeptical of Nvidia and other AI stocks’ sky-high valuations. Stock traders are worried that potential weakness in the economy could make companies think twice before investing in the promising but still risky and unproven technology.

Despite blockbuster earnings last week, Nvidia’s somewhat more tepid outlook disappointed investors who were looking for more upside, and the stock fell.

Nvidia has tumbled more than 20% since its June 18 peak. Microsoft, which has made huge bets on AI technology, has fallen 12% from its most recent peak. And TSMC, Nvidia’s chip manufacturer, has plunged 18% since mid-July.

Meanwhile, Intel, once the world biggest chipmaker, has endured a 59% decline in its share price this year. That company faces its own unique challenges in its bid to remake itself and get into the AI game.

Potential legal problems

But Nvidia may face a different set of problems: The government is reportedly investigating it over potential antitrust violations.

Much of Tuesday’s sharp decline was because the US Justice Department reportedly sent it a subpoena as part of an antitrust probe, according to Bloomberg. CNN could not independently verify the subpoena, and the Department of Justice declined to comment directly on a potential antitrust investigation.

Nvidia on Wednesday afternoon said it has not received a subpoena from the Justice Department.

“We have inquired with the US Department of Justice and have not been subpoenaed,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. “Nonetheless, we are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.”

The Biden administration has been going hard after tech titans, launching probes and lobbing charges against Apple, Google and Amazon, among others. It’s unclear whether a Kamala Harris or Donald Trump administration would continue those cases, but both have criticized tech companies for various reasons during their campaigns.

Nvidia lost another 1.7% Wednesday. The Nasdaq Composite, which tanked more than 3% Tuesday, fell 0.3% Wednesday.

Still, AI bulls continue to believe in Nvidia. The stock remains up 118% this year and has a $2.7 trillion market valuation — a close third behind Apple and Microsoft. Huang said last week that demand for its latest “Blackwell” AI chips “far exceeds its supply.” And even as competition grows, demand for Nvidia’s chips is growing, too.

And the investments are paying off — so far, at least — Huang claims.

“People who are investing in Nvidia infrastructure are getting returns on it right away,” Huang said last week, noting that the company’s new graphics processing units, the GPU chips that power AI, process data so efficiently that they end up saving clients money quickly.

That’s why bulls like Wedbush’s Dan Ives believe Nvidia’s stock decline presents a buying opportunity.

“Nvidia has changed the tech and global landscape as its GPUs have become the new oil and gold in the IT landscape,” Ives said Tuesday in a note to investors.

He was initially placed into police custody on suspicion of blackmail and offenses related to the Computer Misuse Act, according to a statement from West Midlands Police, a law enforcement agency in England.

And was released on bail while the agency “continue with our enquiries.”

The teen is believed to have been working with a “large scale cyber hacking community” that carried out an online attack in September 2023 which left the resort chain vulnerable, according to previous USA TODAY reporting.

MGM Hotels & Casino properties across the country were impacted by the “cybersecurity issues,” going dark in an attempt to protect systems and data, USA TODAY reported.

Customers took to social media to document experience, reporting outages at ATMs, slot machines, restaurants, even with digital room keys over the course of multiple days, according to reporting by TechCrunch.

The resort chain was able to somewhat resume “normal operations” at most properties by Sept. 20, a week after the ransomware attacks were reported, Reuters first reported.

Here’s what we know.

Arrest is part of a larger ‘global investigation,’ authorities say

Multiple international agencies, including the FBI, worked to coordinate the Thursday arrest.

The teen’s arrest serves as a “a testimony to the strength of the FBI’s domestic, international, and private sector partnerships,” Bryan Vorndran, assistant director of the cybercrimes division said in a news release.

“The FBI, in coordination with its partners, will continue to relentlessly pursue malicious actors who target American companies, no matter where they may be located or how sophisticated their techniques are.”

A number of digital devices” were collected from the teen’s home after the arrest. The devices collected are set to undergo forensic examination, according to West Midlands Police.

“The arrest is part of a global investigation into a large scale cyber hacking community which has targeted a number of major companies which includes MGM Resorts in America,” according to the news release.

Hinesh Mehta, part of the West Midlands regional organized crime unit, said investigators will continue to work with the FBI and the National Crime Agency as the situation develops.

“This arrest has been made following a complex investigation which stretches overseas to America … These cyber groups have targeted well known organizations with ransomware and they have successfully targeted multiple victims around the world taking from them significant amounts of money,” Mehta said in the news release.

To all the cybercriminal out there, Mehta has one clear message: “We will find you. It’s simply not worth it.”

‘Forever grateful’ to authorities following arrest, MGM says

The resort chain was proud to have helped authorities locate and arrest “one of the alleged criminals responsible for the cyberattack against MGM Resorts and many others,” according to a statement obtained by USA TODAY on Friday.

“We know first-hand the damage these criminals can do and the importance of working with law enforcement to fight back,” the statement reads.

MGM Resorts says that the message to criminals was made clear last year when they “voluntarily shut down their systems, refused to pay a ransom and worked with law enforcement.”

“It’s not worth it. We are forever grateful to the FBI for their support and work with international law enforcement to bring these criminals to justice,” according to the statement.

Tech giant Microsoft also issued a statement in response to the arrest, writing: “Today sends a strong message to cybercriminals: there will be consequences for your actions.”","The image shows the exterior of the MGM Grand hotel with a large advertisement for 'DAVIDCO' featuring the text 'LIVE THE IMPOSSIBLE'.

d23f895ac2,Financial Times,Google’s James Manyika: ‘The productivity gains from AI are not guaranteed’ - Financial Times,"On a panel last November, OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman predicted there would be an artificial intelligence breakthrough in 2024 that no one saw coming. Google executive James Manyika agreed: “Plus one to that.”

Has the past year lived up to expectations? The summer sell-off in tech stocks reflected a sense that the adoption of AI would take longer than anticipated.

Manyika points to what has been achieved. Transformers — the technology underpinning large language models — have allowed Google Translate to more than double the number of languages it supports to 243. Google’s Gemini chatbot is able to switch seamlessly (at least in certain contexts) between text, photos and videos. It also allows users to enter ever more complex queries.

For example, while commuting from San Francisco to Silicon Valley, Manyika hoped to be able to listen to a summary of recent research in his field: he wanted to put 100 technical papers into Gemini, then hear two AI voices discussing them. “I’m now able to do that. That’s an example of a big breakthrough.”

But many users view LLMs such as Gemini as clever curiosities, not business-critical technology. Does Manyika actually spend his commute listening to AI voices discuss technical papers? The answer seems to be that he still prefers human podcasts.

As Google’s senior vice-president for research, technology and society, Manyika must perform a balancing act. He must spell out the transformational potential of AI, while also convincing policymakers and the public that Google is not pursuing it recklessly.

Last year the “godfather of AI” Geoffrey Hinton resigned from Google, citing the technology’s unmanaged risks. Shortly afterwards, Manyika promised the company would be “responsible from the start”. Born and educated in Zimbabwe, before gaining a robotics doctorate from Oxford, he is a spokesman for the benefits of the technology reaching the developing world.

Manyika, 59, spent his career at McKinsey, before joining Google in 2022. I am interested in how he sees the real-world application of AI tools.

“Right now, everyone from my old colleagues at McKinsey Global Institute to Goldman Sachs are putting out these extraordinary economic potential numbers — in the trillions — [but] it’s going to take a whole bunch of actions, innovations, investments, even enabling policy . . . The productivity gains are not guaranteed. They’re going to take a lot of work.”

In 1987 economist Robert Solow remarked that the computer age was visible everywhere except in the productivity statistics. “We could have a version of that — where we see this technology everywhere, on our phones, in all these chatbots, but it’s done nothing to transform the economy in that real fundamental way.”

The use of generative AI to draft software code is not enough. “In the US, the tech sector is about 4 per cent of the labour force. Even if the entire tech sector adopted it 100 per cent, it doesn’t matter from a labour productivity standpoint.” Instead the answer lies with “very large sectors” such as healthcare and retail.

Former British prime minister Sir Tony Blair has said that people “will have an AI nurse, probably an AI doctor, just as you’ll have an AI tutor”. Manyika is less dramatic: “In most of those cases, those professions will be assisted by AI. I don’t think any of those occupations are going to be replaced by AI, not in any conceivable future.”

The antecedents are not great. While at McKinsey, Manyika predicted that the pandemic would allow companies to pursue digital transformation: he concedes many did so “in a cost-cutting direction”. Now Manyika agrees executives are incentivised to replace workers with AI, rather than deploy the technology to assist them.

How could large language models transform his old industry of management consulting? Manyika emphasises the potential for models such as Gemini to draft and summarise. “In my role, I have teams working on lots of projects: I might say, ‘Give me a status update on project Y,’ and it will give me summaries from all the documents that are in my email and the conversations that we’re having.”

Summarising and drafting are the tasks that, for example, young lawyers perform. Will law firms transform profoundly, as young recruits are no longer required? “Yes, but . . . ” says Manyika, emphasising that his vision is for firms to use AI to increase their top line, not just cut costs.

“You don’t win by cutting costs. You win by creating more valuable outputs. So I would hope that those law firms think about, ‘OK, now we have this new productive capacity, what additional value-added activities do we need to be doing to capitalise on what is now possible?’ Those are going to be the winning firms.”

Google’s search engine dominates the web — last month a US judge found it amounted to an illegal monopoly. But many publishers worry AI could make things worse.

Google now answers some search queries with AI summaries. Chatbots provide an alternative source of information. In both cases, internet users may find what they need without clicking on any links — thereby cutting off the flow of advertising revenue to publishers who came up with the information.

Half the time, people think we shouldn’t release anything. Half the time, people think we’re being too slow

Before I met Manyika in July, I asked Gemini: “What is the top news in the Financial Times today?” Gemini responded: “Several top news stories are featured in the Financial Times today (November 28, 2024)” — sic. The response went on to list five headline stories, most of which seem to date from December 2023.

“But it also sends you to the site. We still provide links in Gemini, right?” says Manyika. In fact, although Gemini mentioned the FT website in its answer, it only provided two links — to rival news websites.

Manyika points to an option in Gemini’s response called “show drafts”. This is Google’s attempt to show that the chatbot produces no “singular, definitive answer” — running the same query twice will have different takes. I didn’t even notice that option, and I doubt users really believe it will compensate for the chatbot’s unreliability.

Discouraging users from clicking on links would be “a terrible own goal”, given Google’s ad-reliant business model, argues Manyika. He likens publishers’ concern about traffic to fears, when search shifted from desktops to smartphones, that only one link would be visible and the rest would be ignored. “People still went to everything else, in a lot of detail.”

(After the interview, a Google publicist sends me a screenshot of a Gemini answer, which does contain a link to the FT website. I tried again but was still unable to replicate this.)

The broader question is whether Google has been pushed to roll out AI products, faster than it would like, in order not to fall behind OpenAI and others. Google’s AI summaries have advised users that, for example, it is healthy to eat rocks.

Only one in 7mn AI summaries has a content policy violation, such as suggesting users eat rocks, Google says. Manyika professes to love Google’s culture of internal debate: “Half the time, people think we shouldn’t release anything. Half the time, people think we’re being too slow.

“We won’t always get those things right, I think that’s OK.” Google has “had lots of things that it’s held back. When I was joining the company, it made a choice not to put out facial recognition technology.” He politely does not mention that, by contrast, OpenAI’s Altman has invested in eyeball-scanning.

Robo-drafting brings other risks. We gain clues about someone’s personality and competence from their writing style. If chatbots take hold, maybe we won’t be able to. Manyika argues that I’m romanticising the present: “When I write you a letter, maybe my assistant has drafted it.”

I give another example: isn’t it unhelpful that, because students use chatbots, many teachers can no longer set written homework? “How many times do you think a teacher who marks 100 essays reads every essay from start to finish?” he replies. This isn’t exactly the point.

Manyika is friends with the singer will.i.am, who “set up a school in Compton, a poor neighbourhood in LA. Those kids have been promised for decades that someone’s going to show up and teach [them] how to code. That person never showed up. Now, when they use an LLM to draft code, is that a good thing or a bad thing?”

The apparent paradox is that, in the very era that Google has brilliantly spread the world’s information, the world appears more susceptible to misinformation. “I don’t know if I’d put that on Google,” says Manyika. Maybe not, but upending the way we get and process information potentially has serious, unforeseen downsides.

Manyika shifts the conversation to quantum computing. “We actually think quantum computing will enable us to build AI differently. Stay tuned — you’re going to see some important milestone news later this year. What hasn’t happened yet . . . is no one has shown a computation that in principle you can’t even do with a classical computer.” The tech believers’ strength is to produce a new trick while the world is still struggling to assess the last one.","A black and white image of a person with a blurred face, wearing a dark shirt, set against a dark background.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA49A3B80>,2024-09-02 03:00:03.032000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/2c122092-51ab-4529-b733-ac466f338cb5,['Technology' 'Business and Finance'],[0.9 0.8],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/d23f895ac2.png
0910401f29,Financial Times,France’s minorities pay the price of a polarising election campaign - Financial Times,"To judge from Sunday’s election result, French politicians can set aside their differences in order to keep the far right out of power. Now they will need to summon the same spirit of unity to heal some of the damage visible in the campaign: a rise in hate crimes by extremists.

The far-right Rassemblement National, a party long shunned as incompatible with the French republic’s values, did not achieve its goal of taking power. But it still won more than a third of all votes cast.

The campaign emboldened extremists at a time when tensions in French society were already running high. Minorities were the first to pay the price as reports of hate crime poured in.

“Since June 9, we have seen an explosion of reports from people flagging racist or antisemitic speech and acts . . . There has been a liberation of speech that is directly linked to the political context,” said Tina Théallet, a spokesperson for Licra, the International League against Racism and Antisemitism.

Little more than a week after the election was called, two teenage boys were charged with raping a 12-year-old Jewish girl. Reports of antisemitic acts had already risen after the Hamas attack on Israel in October and jumped threefold from January to March compared to the first three months of 2023, according to the government.

Other hate crimes are also coming to light. Karim Rissouli, a journalist for public broadcaster France 5, received a letter at his home address that read: “The one and only fundamental reason behind the RN vote is that the historic French people are fed up with all these bicots [a slur for north African] . . . Real French people who stem from France will never accept you nor your brothers, and despite how many of you there are, you will never belong in France.”

Mohamed Bouhafsi, another French journalist of north African descent, received insults on social media. “This type of speech was not around during the 2022 presidential election,” Bouhafsi told France 5. “I did experience some of it before June 9, perhaps once a month . . . Now it’s three or four messages every day.”

Other reported incidents included the attempted drowning of a French teenager of north African descent who aggressors called a “dirty Arab”; “Stop Black people” leaflets in Chatou, a town near Paris; and the filming of RN supporters screaming at their black neighbour to “go back to [her] dog kennel” as “this is our home”.

With the far right’s defeat, the exhilaration of its supporters is turning to frustration, which is no less conducive to violence. On Sunday, rugby player Melvyn Jaminet expressed his disappointment in a social media video in which he said he would hit “the first Arab I see on the street” with his helmet.

Racism towards immigrants from former French colonies existed before this time. I recently came across footage of my mother interviewed about the rise of the far right in 1986 in Marseille. It showed “Front National” and “Death to Melons” — a slur for north Africans — on the walls of the banlieues that housed and still house many immigrants.

And politicians have long exploited racial tensions to gain votes. Most recently, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the radical leftist leader, has played down the rise in antisemitic crime as he courted Muslim voters.

But before the second-round vote, a far-right government seemed a distinct possibility. It generated fear and confusion that some French psychologists compared to the widespread anguish among their patients after the 2015 Paris terror attacks.

The climate of confusion is likely to persist as France now has a hung parliament, with no clear path yet for how it will be governed until the next election, which may come next year.

The campaign did see demonstrations against the far right in Paris and other cities. But overall, the picture is bleak. In a survey by pollster Ipsos, more than half of voters who supported the far right in the election’s first round admitted to being “rather” or “a little” racist.

President Emmanuel Macron’s gamble may not only have exposed but widened fractures within French society. Politicians need to urgently start work on mending them. This could determine France’s fate after the next election.","A man in a white shirt is seen through the window of a car, with his face blurred out.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA1ED4160>,2024-07-10 15:42:25.856000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/41580b1b-94d1-4375-8e48-a41ae6b59945,['Politics' 'International' 'Local/Regional'],[0.9  0.75 0.6 ],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/0910401f29.png
16fcfc5ebd,Global News Toronto,Canada’s Phil (Wizard) Kim wins gold in breaking - Global News Toronto,"PARIS – Phil Kim was the first, and for the foreseeable future, the only Olympic champion in men’s breaking.

The 27-year-old from Vancouver, known in his breaking circles as B-Boy Phil Wizard, captured gold at Place de la Concorde on Saturday.

The Canadian dominated his final battle with host-country favourite Danis Civil (Dany Dann) of France by winning all three rounds and taking 23 of a possible 27 votes from the judges.

The 2022 world champion and reigning Pan American Games champion Kim was a favourite in the performance sport making its Olympic debut in Paris.

It isn’t on the menu in Los Angeles in 2028 nor is it certain to return in Brisbane, Australia, in 2032.

The sunny, charismatic Kim was that throughout his bouts Saturday, but he shed tears both on the podium during O Canada, in interviews afterward and when he embraced his mother Gilsoo, father Byung Tae and brothers Daniel and John.

“I was stressed out of my mind,” Kim said. “Yesterday, I cried my eyes out because I was so scared to do this.

“There’s been a lot of pressure and a lot of expectations. I’m glad I was able to deliver. More than anything I’m glad I just enjoyed the moment. I truly had a lot of fun today.

“This is history in the making for us, so it’s incredible.”

The Olympic Games brought from its urban hip-hop roots to a broader international sport stage a sport that pushes the limits of human body movement performed to a beat.

“I hope it opens doors for people,” Kim said. “I’ve dedicated my life to this and so have all of us competing today, and it’s an underappreciated sport.”

The breakers were not forewarned of the beat provided by DJ’s Phlash One and Fleg, but expressed the music when they heard it through footwork, freezes, transitions, power moves, tricks and flips.

The men’s creative instincts worked as hard as their bodies Saturday to avoid repetition and impress the judges at the packed temporary venue that also served as the site of three-on-three basketball in Paris.

Kim dropped just one round in the group stage in which battles are two rounds, but defeated Ukraine’s Oleh Kuznetsov (Kuzya) 10-8 in overall votes en route to topping his group undefeated.

Kim started the knockout stage by ousting Lee-Lou Diouf Demierre, better known as Lee, of the Netherlands 3-0 (19-8) in a quarterfinal.

Kim knocked Shigeyuki Nakarai (Shigekix) to the bronze-medal bout with a 3-0 (17-10) victory in the semifinal.

Reigning world champ Victor Montalvo of the United States, who is known simply as Victor, defeated the Japanese for bronze.

“It was next level. Everyone was on their A-game,” Montalvo said. “It was very difficult, maybe the most difficult of my career, but it was fun.”

After sweeping Civil 2-0 in his bout of the day, Kim unleashed a dizzying array of sequences in the gold-medal battle to best the Frenchman again.

“I was lucky, because I battled Danny Dan early on in the round-robin, and so I knew what to expect going into it,” Kim said.

Breakers are judged on technique, vocabulary — which is variety of moves, styles, and transitions — execution, musicality and originality with each counting for 20 per cent of the score.

“It’s my spontaneity,” Kim explained. “I go up there with truly nothing in my head. I just go up there and whatever the music dictates me to do, I do.

“Because of that, I can create some magic moments.”

Nine judges, who also go by single names, warmed up the crowd with their own breaking session as they were introduced.

MCs Malik and Max had to urge spectators to stop booing the elimination of acrobatic Hiroto Ono (Hiro10) of Japan from the group stage.

“To the naked eye, it’s very easy to think that the person who’s spinning the most, that is doing the craziest moves is going to win,” Kim explained.

“All my respect to Hiro. He’s an incredible person, an incredible kid. I have so much love for him, but there’s a lot of details within the dance.

“For us, it’s all about style and originality. I hope people continue to watch breaking and start to understand.”

bc38d24a6f,Bloomberg,A Break in the Weather: Good News From the World’s Farms - Bloomberg,"The headlines suggest catastrophe for the global food supply: Biblical heatwaves, floods, storms and wildfires. And yet, in the world’s breadbaskets, the weather has been fair this growing season — so good that we’re facing an oversupply of key agricultural commodities and thus much lower prices than in 2022 and 2023.

If the favorable weather persists for a couple more months, the low farm prices we enjoyed from 2015 to 2020 are on the cusp of a return. In a world still unconvinced that inflation has been slain, the drop in wholesale food prices means there’s one less thing for central bankers to worry about as they ease monetary policy.

Let me emphasize the word “wholesale” — what you and I pay depends upon numerous other costs — and on whether manufacturers and retailers pass on the savings or expand their profit margins.

The fine weather stretches from the US Midwest to the plains of Kazakhstan; from the Brazilian savannah to the Australian grasslands. Even in my home country of Spain, so important for olive-oil production, the growing season has been about right.

The market is frontrunning the expected bumper harvests. The cost of wheat, corn and soybeans has already fallen to a four-year low, down about 50% from the all-time high set in 2022 after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Rice prices are lagging, but those costs are about to hit a one-year low. Olive-oil prices, closely tracked in my kitchen, are down 25% from their record high set in January, and probably have further to fall.

Of course, there are exceptions: Coffee prices remain sky high, while the costs of cocoa and some vegetables remain high by historical standards. At supermarkets and restaurants, prices are also higher than before, but that has a lot to do with energy costs and wages, rather than food inputs.

To be sure, it’s hot – too hot: July marked the 14th-consecutive month of record-high temperatures for the planet, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But that doesn’t mean catastrophe for the world’s breadbaskets.

The weather isn’t the only reason why the world is heading toward lower food prices. The last two decades have seen huge improvements in agronomics. Seeds yield far more than before, even when rain and temperatures aren’t ideal, and irrigation has expanded. Farmers have access to much better hardware: large planters, powerful tractors, improved combines, larger storage facilities.

Compared with a decade ago, the world will harvest in 2024-25 about 10% more wheat, about 15% more corn, nearly 30% more soybeans, and about 10% more rice. Except for corn, all the other three key food commodities will enjoy a record high production.

Few regions show that combination of fair weather and scientific advances more clearly than the American Midwest.

On Monday, the US Department of Agriculture said it anticipates American farmers will reap record yields for two key food commodities: on average, 183.1 bushels per acre of corn, and 53.2 bushels per acre of soybeans. Those numbers may sound alien to anyone who hasn’t set foot on a farm. Scott Irwin, a veteran agricultural economist at the University of Illinois in Champaign, about two hours drive south of Chicago, put the statistics into a very graphic description of the overgrowth: “jungle-like.”","An industrial machine is pouring a large quantity of grain into a pile, with a clear blue sky and a green building in the background.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x152 at 0x7D6BA2A2B490>,2024-08-14 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.bloomberg.com,https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-08-14/food-costs-are-falling-as-farmers-help-slay-the-inflation-dragon,['Business and Finance' 'Weather and Environment'],[0.95 0.85],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/bc38d24a6f.png
cabe4de375,CNN,China is watching warily as Putin and Kim forge new ‘alliance’ - CNN,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.

As Russian President Vladimir Putin glided through the crowd-lined streets of Pyongyang atop a luxury Mercedes-Benz alongside his North Korean host Kim Jong Un last week, the two autocrats’ most important partner was watching from the sidelines hundreds of miles away in Beijing.

Five years ago, Xi Jinping was offered the same open-top ride with Kim when he became the first Chinese leader to visit Pyongyang in 14 years. At the time, the two leaders vowed to strengthen ties and deepen cooperation, but the language paled in comparison with the “breakthrough” new partnership struck by Kim and Putin.

In a wide-ranging treaty spanning political, trade, investment, and security cooperation, North Korea and Russia pledged to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance in the event the other is attacked.

Putin said Russia and North Korea have ramped up ties to a “new level.” Kim, meanwhile, called the new “alliance” a “watershed moment” in bilateral relations.

The new landmark defense pact agreed by the two nuclear-armed regimes rattled the United States and its Asian allies. Japan voiced “grave concerns” about Putin’s vow not to rule out cooperation with Pyongyang on military technology. South Korea responded by convening an emergency national security meeting and said it would now consider sending arms to Ukraine.

In contrast, the reaction from China, the main political and economic patron for both Russia and North Korea, has been all but muted.

A spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the treaty, calling it a bilateral matter between Russia and North Korea.

Beneath the official reticence, however, China is likely watching warily, analysts say.

China ‘aims to control the situation’

The deepening ties between two wayward autocrats risk creating new uncertainty for Xi, who needs peace and stability in Northeast Asia as he grapples with a raft of domestic challenges, especially the slowing economy.

Beijing is worried that Moscow’s assistance to Pyongyang – especially on military technology – would further enable and embolden the erratic Kim regime, which has drastically accelerated the buildup of nuclear weapons and missile programs, said Liu Dongshu, an assistant professor focusing on Chinese politics at the City University of Hong Kong.

“When it comes to the North Korea issue, China aims to control the situation and prevent escalation, but it also does not want North Korea to completely collapse either” – a scenario that Beijing fears would allow the US to extend its control right to its doorstep, Liu said.

Previously, Russia had been largely aligned with China on the issue, but its desperate need for North Korea to support its grinding war in Ukraine risks undermining the delicate balance.

Russia has received more than 10,000 shipping containers – the equivalent of 260,000 metric tons of munitions or munitions-related material – from North Korea since September, according to a US statement in February. Both Russia and North Korea have rejected the claim.

And while the US has accused China of providing Russia with dual-use goods that bolster the warring nation’s military industrial complex, Beijing has refrained from offering direct military assistance to Putin and has steered clear of supporting Kim’s nuclear and missile programs.

“If Putin provides more support to North Korea on nuclear issues, including some technical assistance, it will become more difficult for China to control the situation on the Korean Peninsula,” Liu said.

The mutual defense pact signed by Kim and Putin harks back to a 1961 treaty between North Korea and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. That deal was replaced with one that offered much weaker security assurances after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

But North Korea’s mutual defense treaty with China, also signed in 1961, remains in place after multiple renewals.

The Sino-North Korea Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance is the only formal military alliance treaty China has signed with another country, though Beijing doesn’t admit it as such and remains deliberately vague about whether China is obliged to automatically come to North Korea’s defense when a war breaks out.

Similarly, it remains unclear what Russia and North Korea are willing – and able – to do for one another under the new defense pact.

The new treaty comes amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, where Kim has ramped up fiery rhetoric and scrapped a longstanding policy of seeking peaceful reunification with South Korea. After the end of the Korean War in 1953, a formal peace treaty was never signed between the two Koreas, leaving them technically in a state of war.

But the political message of the pact is loud and clear. Driven by a shared hostility to the US and its allies, the two autocratic nations are seeking to undermine and create an alternative to the Western-led global order – a goal shared by China.

Speaking after his meeting with Kim, Putin rankled against what he called “the imperialist policy of the United States and its satellites.”

A month ago, Putin and Xi delivered a similar swipe at the US during the Russian leader’s visit to Beijing. In a sweeping joint statement, the two “old friends” took aim at what they described as a global security system defined by US-backed military alliances – and pledged to work together to counter it.

Western observers have warned against a loose but growing coordination of interests among China, Russia, North Korea and Iran – something one senior US military commander recently likened to a new “axis of evil.”

As Moscow and Pyongyang deepen their alliance, Beijing would be cautious to keep a distance, Liu said, adding that “China certainly doesn’t want to be seen as part of a new Axis.”

But despite the absence of Xi, China would have been the elephant in the room throughout Putin and Kim’s meeting.

“Any such meeting will also include discussion of China,” said Edward Howell, a lecturer in politics at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, who focuses on the Korean Peninsula.

“Russia will know full well that China does not want to be left out of any substantial negotiations involving North Korea, not least since China is far more important – compared to Russia – to North Korea.”

Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Washington-based Stimson Center think tank, said China doesn’t feel it can control the pace and extent of the deepening engagement between Russia and North Korea.

“But they do know that China plays an irreplaceable role for both Russia and North Korea,” she said.

China remains the largest trade partner to both Russia and North Korea, providing a crucial lifeline to the heavily sanctioned economies. Beijing also lends significant political support and diplomatic cover to the two international pariahs.

3a5763aebd,Financial Times,UK waste confronts its carbon problem - Financial Times,"Pizza boxes, coffee cups and food packaging: roughly 15mn tonnes of these household waste items are gathered around the UK per year and sent to incinerators.

These incineration plants make money not only from fees to take the waste but also from the electricity that is produced from the steam created from flue gases in the 1,000-degree centigrade furnaces. That has made the plants an appealing proposition for investors ranging from KKR, the US investment giant, and Suez, the French utility.

That appeal is now being tested. The “energy-from-waste” sector is under pressure as the UK government tries to curb the country’s greenhouse gas emissions in line with its legally binding commitment to net zero emissions by 2050.

Ministers have paused environmental permits for new plants and plan to make the sector start paying for its emissions, triggering potentially large costs for its customers, which include cash-strapped local authorities.

The number of energy-from-waste plants in the UK has soared since taxes were introduced in 1996 to deter the amount of waste sent to landfill, with 60 operational today and a further 12 being built.

The fleet accounted for about 3 per cent of the country’s power generation in 2022, but also emitted more than 6mn tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, up 5 per cent on 2020. That raised alarm at the Climate Change Committee, which advises the UK government; it argues that the UK needs to boost stagnant recycling rates and prevent waste. The emissions figure does not include emissions from biogenic waste, which are counted as carbon neutral in the UK.

Wales introduced a moratorium on new energy-from-waste plants in 2021, while Scotland says it will only support developments “in very limited circumstances”. Last month, UK government ministers said they would pause issuing new environmental permits in England until May 24 while they review the case for new plants, sending jitters through the sector.

“There are a lot of worried investors about the implications of this political interference in what should just be a purely technical determination,” said Jacob Hayler, executive director of the Environmental Services Association trade group.

The move came after the UK government said last year that it planned to include the energy-from-waste sector from 2028 in its emissions trading scheme, under which polluters have to pay for the carbon dioxide they emit.

The cost of emissions is currently low, at roughly £40 per tonne, but that is expected to rise as the scheme is tightened up.

“We think this is going to be a massive driver of change for our sector,” added Hayler. “Our working assumption is that [carbon credits] are going to cost about £100 per tonne.” That compares with median payments from local authorities in 2022 of £103 per tonne of waste taken, according to a study by Wrap, a non-governmental organisation dedicated to tackling the climate crisis.

Energy-from-waste is being included in the emissions scheme despite objections from local councils which, depending on contract terms, face having to foot the bill for the waste they send to incinerators.

“We are concerned about the potential financial impacts to councils,” said Darren Rodwell, Labour leader for Barking and Dagenham Council and environment spokesperson for the Local Government Association.

“For the scheme to succeed it is critical that the costs fall on the industries producing the material in the first place, rather than the council that collects, processes and disposes of the waste.”

Several energy-from-waste plant owners are now looking at plans to fit their plants with technology to capture their emissions. Yet carbon capture and storage systems have yet to be proven at scale in the UK and may not be suitable for many.

“[Carbon capture] is not a silver bullet for the entire industry,” said Cory Reynolds, director of corporate affairs at Veolia, one of the UK’s largest operators, which is exploring using the technology at one of its plants. “We need to focus on the prevention of fossil carbon emissions by removing plastics from the waste stream input.”

Enfinium, which owns four plants and is building two more, outlined plans this month under which it would potentially invest £1.7bn in cutting emissions, including carbon-capture technology, across its fleet.

“I want the industry to be creating a solution before it becomes a problem,” said Mike Maudsley, chief executive of Enfinium, owned by Igneo Infrastructure Partners.

He and others also believe that they could generate new revenue streams by generating so-called “negative emissions” and selling credits to other companies struggling to cut their own.

The idea is that because emissions from biogenic waste, such as food and garden waste are considered carbon neutral, capturing and storing them would amount to a net removal.

Rival Viridor, which was bought by KKR for £4.2bn in 2020, last month said it would enter final negotiations with the government over support for carbon-capture technology at its plant in Runcorn, claiming this could generate about 450,000 tonnes of “negative emissions” per year.

The CCC and others acknowledge that “negative emissions” will be needed to offset emissions from sectors struggling to decarbonise, and that energy-from-waste plants could contribute to this.

However, that is likely to spark debate about the carbon accounting behind the treatment of biogenic waste, which can include products such as kitchen roll and contaminated paper.

The CCC maintains that reducing waste should remain the goal. “Although negative emissions from energy-from-waste plants may be possible, emissions from the waste sector should be reduced through increased recycling and a reduction in the amount of waste produced,” it said.

The UK government’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it was “committed to reducing waste, improving recycling and meeting our net zero ambitions by sending less waste for incineration”.

“We must make sure we have the right waste management infrastructure to meet these goals, and are rightly considering the need for more waste incineration facilities.”","An image of a large pile of waste, possibly plastic, with a crane lifting a heavy object, set in a dimly lit industrial environment.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA4B637F0>,2024-05-12 04:00:21.344000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/34ccb019-d984-4b33-ae7a-37c513f1a230,['Weather and Environment' 'Politics'],[0.85 0.75],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/3a5763aebd.png
fff0ecb91b,The New York Times,Opinion | Melinda French Gates: The Enemies of Progress Play Offense. I Want to Help Even the Match. - The New York Times,"Many years ago, I received this piece of advice: “Set your own agenda, or someone else will set it for you.” I’ve carried those words with me ever since.

That’s why, next week, I will leave the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, of which I was a co-founder almost 25 years ago, to open a new chapter in my philanthropy. To begin, I am announcing $1 billion in new spending over the next two years for people and organizations working on behalf of women and families around the world, including on reproductive rights in the United States.

In nearly 20 years as an advocate for women and girls, I have learned that there will always be people who say it’s not the right time to talk about gender equality. Not if you want to be relevant. Not if you want to be effective with world leaders (most of them men). The second the global agenda gets crowded, women and girls fall off.

It’s frustrating and shortsighted. Decades of research on economics, well-being and governance make it clear that investing in women and girls benefits everyone. We know that economies with women’s full participation have more room to grow. That women’s political participation is associated with decreased corruption. That peace agreements are more durable when women are involved in writing them. That reducing the time women spend in poor health could add as much as $1 trillion to the global economy by 2040.

And yet, around the world, women are seeing a tremendous upsurge in political violence and other threats to their safety, in conflict zones where rape is used as a tool of war, in Afghanistan where the Taliban takeover has erased 20 years of progress for women and girls, in many low-income countries where the number of acutely malnourished pregnant and breastfeeding women is soaring.

In the United States, maternal mortality rates continue to be unconscionable, with Black and Native American mothers at highest risk. Women in 14 states have lost the right to terminate a pregnancy under almost any circumstances. We remain the only advanced economy without any form of national paid family leave. And the number of teenage girls experiencing suicidal thoughts and persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness is at a decade high.

Despite the pressing need, only about 2 percent of charitable giving in the United States goes to organizations focused on women and girls, and only about half a percentage point goes to organizations focused on women of color specifically.

When we allow this cause to go so chronically underfunded, we all pay the cost. As shocking as it is to contemplate, my 1-year-old granddaughter may grow up with fewer rights than I had.

Over the past few weeks, as part of the $1 billion in new funding I’m committing to these efforts, I have begun directing new grants through my organization, Pivotal, to groups working in the United States to protect the rights of women and advance their power and influence. These include the National Women’s Law Center, the National Domestic Workers Alliance and the Center for Reproductive Rights.

While I have long focused on improving contraceptive access overseas, in the post-Dobbs era, I now feel compelled to support reproductive rights here at home. For too long, a lack of money has forced organizations fighting for women's rights into a defensive posture while the enemies of progress play offense. I want to help even the match.

I’m also experimenting with novel tactics to bring a wider range of perspectives into philanthropy. Recently, I offered 12 people whose work I admire their own $20 million grant-making fund to distribute as he or she sees fit. That group — which includes the former prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, the athlete and maternal-health advocate Allyson Felix, and an Afghan champion of girls’ education, Shabana Basij-Rasikh — represents a wide range of expertise and experience. I’m eager to see the landscape of funding opportunities through their eyes, and the results their approaches unlock.

In the fall, I will introduce a $250 million initiative focused on improving the mental and physical health of women and girls globally. By issuing an open call to grass-roots organizations beyond the reach of major funders, I hope to lift up groups with personal connections to the issues they work on. People on the front lines should get the attention and investment they deserve, including from me.

As a young woman, I could never have imagined that one day I would be part of an effort like this. Because I have been given this extraordinary opportunity, I am determined to do everything I can to seize it and to set an agenda that helps other women and girls set theirs, too.","A woman with long hair stands in front of a background with a checkered pattern of US dollar bills, one of which is labeled '890 C'.",<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x117 at 0x7D6BA13E45B0>,2024-05-28 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.nytimes.com,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/28/opinion/melinda-french-gates-reproductive-rights.html,['Opinion/Editorial' 'Politics'],[0.95 0.85],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/fff0ecb91b.png
67ca46ae64,The Guardian,Ed Miliband to lead UK negotiations at Cop29 climate summit - The Guardian,"Ed Miliband is to take personal control of the UK’s negotiations at vital international climate talks, in stark contrast to his Tory predecessors.

The energy security and net zero secretary will attend Cop29, this year’s UN climate summit, in Azerbaijan this November to head the UK’s delegation and meet political leaders from around the world.

Senior figures in climate diplomacy welcomed the move and said UK leadership would be vital to what is expected to be a tricky and fraught UN climate summit this year.

Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief who presided over the Paris agreement, now founding partner of the Global Optimism thinktank, said: “Ed Miliband has proven experience at Cops and all matters related to those multilateral negotiations. Throughout 14 years he has kept his vigilant eye on the ups and downs, and will not need to start from scratch at all.”

Under the last government, Cop was largely left to junior ministers, despite the importance and far-reaching nature of the negotiations.

Graham Stuart, the climate minister who led for the UK at Cop28, left the summit at an important moment to fly back to the UK for a vote on Rwanda, but returned for the finish.

Figueres said: “The fact that the multilateral negotiations will be led by the secretary of energy himself instead of delegating to a junior minister denotes recognition of the importance of the process as we near the halfway point in this decisive decade. We could not be more pleased with the news.”

Heads of state and government also attend Cops, though usually only for a few days at the start. Last year, Rishi Sunak spent longer flying to and from Cop28 in Dubai than he spent on the ground at the conference, while other world leaders spent several days there. Sunak also snubbed other key climate talks and was said by experts to have damaged the UK’s reputation for climate leadership with his U-turns on climate action.

Keir Starmer also visited Cop28 and spent time with senior leaders including John Kerry, then a US presidential envoy.

Governments are preparing for one of the most difficult UN climate summits in recent years in Baku. At the top of the agenda will be climate finance for developing countries, to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the effects of extreme weather.

Developing countries are angry that the rich countries that have done most to cause the climate crisis are shirking their responsibilities to provide assistance to the poorest. They want an agreement that will lead to trillions of dollars, some of it from overseas aid and from international development banks, but much of it also in the form of investment from the private sector, flowing to the global south each year.

The new foreign secretary, David Lammy, attended Cop28 last year and has forged good relationships with developing countries around the world, which is likely to help the UK to bridge differences between the global south and the rich world.

The geopolitical situation is also likely to be fraught: the war in nearby Ukraine will cast a long shadow, as will the conflict in Gaza; the US and China are at loggerheads over trade; France is in political turmoil, and Germany facing economic and political challenges. Above all, the US election the week before could put Donald Trump back in the White House.

Nicholas Stern, an economist and longtime adviser to governments at Cops, and chair of the Grantham Research Institute on climate at the London School of Economics, said: “Miliband’s direct involvement in leading the UK negotiating team will signal to other countries the commitment of the new government at cabinet level, and will allow the UK to act strongly and with authority in driving ambitious action. Miliband has a deep understanding of the complexities of the process based on many years of experience, and he will command respect and confidence both from his colleagues and from other countries.”

Todd Stern, a former US climate envoy under Barack Obama, said: “This makes a ton of sense. [Miliband] is a real diplomat, he understands diplomacy and has a skilled understanding of the issues. The UK can play an important role at this point, in working with Europe, the US and the developed world and the developing world.”

Rachel Kyte, a former chief climate official at the World Bank and now professor of climate policy at the University of Oxford, said: “In a climate crisis, having a senior minister taking the reins makes sense. [Miliband’s] personal engagement sends a signal of UK seriousness, as Starmer has promised. Climate is a head of government issue, as it impacts growth, prosperity and security. The Starmer-Miliband relationship will be key as we navigate difficult times.”","A man in a blue suit and tie stands in front of a blurred background with trees and people, with the logo of 'The Guardian' visible in the bottom right corner.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BA2BE0880>,2024-07-15 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/15/ed-miliband-lead-uk-negotiations-cop29-climate-summit,['Politics' 'International' 'Weather and Environment'],[0.9  0.85 0.8 ],Unlikely,Likely,sample_review/images/67ca46ae64.png
f3a5a6b0c7,The Guardian,Dumping gender and sexuality questions from the census doesn’t make us less gay – it leaves us uninformed | Liz Allen - The Guardian,"All roads lead to the census. For knowledge about who we are as a community – even the very roads we drive on – the census is the guiding beacon of truth.

Counting people and finding out the who, what and where is central to tax reallocation, identifying needs and providing resources. Without quality census data, governments are blindfolded.

Democracy depends on the census to inform electoral representation and help fight misinformation and disinformation.

But on Sunday something extraordinary happened. The Australian government intervened in the independent conduct of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) after lengthy public consultation and quietly dumped a proposal to include a question about sexuality and gender diversity in the upcoming census.

The ABS has done significant work trying to rebuild public trust in the census after the technical blunders of #censusfail and budget cuts affecting surveying. The first major changes in a generation were made to the 2021 census and the 2026 one was set to be the most progressive population survey the nation has ever seen.

Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email

The ABS held meetings with experts and advocates and waded through thousands of correspondence from interested people. The bureau was about to make recommendations to the government on what was to be included in the 2026 questionnaire. Long-term census observers, including yours truly, were excitedly awaiting a briefing on Monday morning on the next steps. Sunday morning’s scoop from Sky News pulled the rug out from us all.

Among the mooted changes, a voluntary sexual orientation question for adults was a likely inclusion. Methodologically the question of sexual orientation had been proven by the ABS to work successfully in the General Social Survey and deliver important insights into social and health disparities among queer folk.

Unlike the previous Liberal government, Labor appeared open to including a question on sexual orientation. While in opposition, the Labor MP Stephen Jones tweeted, upon learning Michael Sukkar would not have approved a question on sexual orientation: “It is now clear that the Minister’s office has interfered with the ABS Census process … They didn’t want to ask questions on Sexual Orientation. Did this come from the PM?”

The same questions should be asked again.

The government is yet to release any meaningful statement explaining why it would blindside Australians and the ABS at the last minute.

The ABS has called out the government’s actions, acknowledging how crushing this ordeal has been.

If dumping these questions was not about money or methodology, is it simply political?

Politics has surrounded Australian censuses but not featured in the process like Trump’s attempts in 2019. Nevertheless, what we’ve seen this week in Australia is unprecedented. The government supported an open and transparent process and then interfered and undercut an independent agency at the last minute.

Worldwide, traditional census-taking is losing favour. The Office for National Statistics in the United Kingdom is looking to dump the survey in favour of administrative data. The ABS has undertaken its own technical work demonstrating how administrative data can produce legislatively mandated population statistics.

But if we leave census-taking to data crunchers collating information about citizens from the likes of Medicare and Centrelink, the nation will be left poorer and less informed. Especially on measures of identity and social indicators.

I don’t hold hope for any major shift in political appetite to be bold and do what is needed on data collection. Sadly it appears political survival is more important than the nation’s interests.

What does it say about us as a nation that we are aggrieved by a voluntary question on sexual orientation? Identity politics appears to be denying our diversity – and no, denying diversity doesn’t make it magically go away. A question on the census won’t make us more or less gay.","A large crowd of people marching, some holding rainbow flags and a large balloon shaped like a fish with a rainbow tail.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BCA72C520>,2024-08-28 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/28/australia-census-gender-equality-sexuality-question-lgbtiq-response,['Politics' 'Health' 'Other'],[0.9 0.7 0.6],Likely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/f3a5a6b0c7.png
c8651de09e,HuffPost,How To Say 'I Love You' To Your Cat In Their Language - HuffPost,"If you have a cat, you probably know they aren’t always in the mood for being kissed, hugged or otherwise adored by humans. It feels like a trap, though — if they’re not into snuggling, why are they so damn snuggly?

Every cat has a different temperament depending on their age, social upbringing and genetics, but one thing’s consistent across the board: In order to earn the privilege of hanging out with these sassy floof monsters, we have to respect their boundaries.

Advertisement

So how do we express affection in their language? It’s long been rumored that blinking slowly at a cat indicates we love them and that they are safe with us. And, legend has it, if they slow-blink back, it means that the feeling’s mutual.

But is it real? Or just a Disney-like fantasy we’ve sold ourselves?

That’s what we — Raj Punjabi and Noah Michelson, hosts of HuffPost’s “Am I Doing It Wrong?” podcast — asked Mikel Delgado, Ph.D., a cat behaviorist and scientist, when we recently chatted with her to better understand our furry friends.

Listen to the full episode by pressing play:

“It’s real. It’s not a myth, it’s science,” Delgado told us. “There’s been research behind the slow blink that did suggest that cats do slow-blink in return and they do seem to respond positively to it.”

Advertisement

While the concept of blinking at each other to express a message may feel like supernatural communication, Delgado explained that the action is a primal indicator to our cats that we’re “friendly.” Staring at them or holding their gaze can be read as threatening to them. Slow-blinking is vastly different — it indicates that we are, in fact, not a threat, she said. Basically, it signals to them that we come in peace.

Some scientists, including Delgado, believe that while cats may look to their human as a parental figure of sorts, they most likely do not mistake us for other cats. However, they may still engage in positively associated cat behavior — showing off an upward-pointed tail, a face nuzzle, or the infamous slow blink — with us. “You can look at how cats interact with each other and they do some looking away and closing their eyes to diffuse conflict,” Delgado said. “So it makes complete sense [that they would do this with us too]. And yes, it’s one thing that we can say has been backed by science. So slow-blink away.”

Aside from confirming that the slow blink is the way to our cats’ hearts, we also learned about where they hate being pet, how to make their litter box feel like a spa, and why they do that adorable kneading thing (biscuits, anyone?).

3a9d7afd8c,Financial Times,Germany issues arrest warrant for Ukrainian over Nord Stream gas pipeline attacks - Financial Times,"Germany’s chief prosecutor has issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian man suspected of blowing up the Nord Stream gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea nearly two years ago.

A spokesperson for the Polish prosecutor’s office, Anna Adamiak, on Wednesday confirmed the German authorities issued the European arrest warrant in June for Volodymyr Z, a Ukrainian citizen who had been living in Poland. The spokesperson said he moved to Ukraine in early July, before he could be arrested.

The identification of the alleged perpetrator marks a breakthrough in the long-running investigation into the what was one of the most spectacular acts of sabotage in Europe’s recent history.

Details of the arrest warrant were first reported by the Swedish paper Expressen and a group of German media outlets. Expressen named the suspect as Volodymyr Zhuravlov, aged 44. He is suspected of “anti-constitutional sabotage and causing an explosion”.

The German prosecutor’s office declined to comment.

Wolfgang Büchner, a spokesperson for Germany’s government, also declined to comment on the issuance of the warrant, saying only: “Regardless of whatever result such investigations reach, that doesn’t alter the fact that Russia is conducting a war of aggression against Ukraine that violates international law”.

The undersea blasts on September 26 2022, near the Danish island of Bornholm, ruptured a pipeline that before Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine had carried 40 per cent of Russia’s gas exports to Europe.

Russia had halted supplies through Nord Stream 1, its main conduit for gas into Germany, before the blasts occurred, in what was seen at the time as an attempt to press European governments to reduce their support for Kyiv.

A parallel pipeline, Nord Stream 2, never started operations after Berlin cancelled its approval process in February 2022, just days before Russia invaded Ukraine. It was also damaged by the explosion.

The two lines had long been a source of friction between Berlin and its neighbours, which said they would increase Russia’s control of European energy markets by bypassing Poland and Ukraine and supplying gas directly into the region’s largest economy and manufacturing powerhouse.

The blasts drastically reduced Moscow’s ability to use its energy exports as leverage over Europe. Russia accounted for just 16 per cent of EU gas imports in 2023, down from 46 per cent in 2021.

Russia and the west long accused each other of being behind the explosion.

Public broadcaster ARD said the alleged attackers had rented a German sailing yacht, the Andromeda, in September 2022, and used it to sail into the Baltic Sea. In July 2023, investigators discovered traces of explosives on the boat, which they believed were used to transport the charges for the attack.

The broadcaster said investigators had identified two other Ukrainian citizens, one a woman, as potential suspects. They believed the two, both experienced divers, might have been responsible for attaching the explosives to the pipelines.

ARD also reported that police and prosecutors had found no evidence that the Ukrainian military or intelligence services were involved in the attacks. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has always denied his government was involved.

Sweden and Denmark suspended their investigation into the blasts at the start of 2024, but the German prosecutor’s office continued its probe.

The media reports said German investigators had succeeded in gathering enough evidence for an arrest warrant against Zhuravlov from a judge at the German Federal Court at the beginning of June.

They then approached the Polish authorities with a European arrest warrant.

Adamiak at the Polish prosecutor’s office said the agency “took steps to confirm” where Zhuravlov was staying, “which would have allowed his detention” and transfer to Germany.

But the arrest did not take place “as he left the territory of Poland in early July this year, crossing the Polish-Ukrainian border”.

Authorities in Warsaw indicated the Ukrainian suspect’s name had not been entered into the “Schengen register” which contains the names of wanted persons subject to a European arrest warrant. Adamiak said the Polish border guard had “no basis” for detaining Zhuravlov, because information about him “was not in the database of wanted persons”.","An aerial view of a large, circular disturbance in the ocean, with a white center and ripples extending outward.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BCC03C250>,2024-08-14 08:00:33.612000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/b427976c-f059-466c-9c85-65bdeb45c755,['International' 'Politics'],[0.95 0.9 ],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/3a9d7afd8c.png
b22c0ebaf7,The Globe and Mail,Opinion: Business acumen is the antidote to the political backlash against migration - The Globe and Mail,"Rabaa Biry could teach a master class in perseverance.

When civil war erupted in her home country of Syria in 2011, Ms. Biry was a university student who dreamed of becoming a lawyer. Determined to complete her education, she spent three years attending classes at Damascus University’s faculty of law despite the bombs and military forces in the streets.

Ms. Biry, who speaks English, French and Arabic, graduated with her bachelor’s degree. But the worsening violence forced her to flee to Turkey in 2015. There she completed a master’s degree in political science and international relations. A rising tide of anti-Syrian racism and a lack of social services, however, made it impossible for her to put down roots.

That’s when Ms. Biry enrolled in Talent Beyond Boundaries, a program that matches displaced workers with jobs at businesses around the world. This past April, Ms. Biry got her big break in Canada. The 32-year-old single mother, who has a son with special needs, landed a job as a senior business immigration analyst at global law firm Fragomen in Toronto. It’s a first step toward her long-term goal of becoming a lawyer.

“When we think about refugees, we have to think about their dreams too,” Ms. Biry said in an interview.

Ms. Biry is far from alone. As of May, there were more than 120 million people around the world who were forcibly displaced because of persecution, conflict, violence or human-rights violations, according to the United Nations. Of that total, 43.4 million are considered conventional refugees – with most originating from Afghanistan, Syria, Venezuela, Ukraine and Sudan.

As the global refugee crisis rages, so too does the social and political backlash against migrants in the West. The resentment is pronounced in the United States, Britain and European Union countries where migration has become a wedge issue at the polls.

Tensions are also flaring in Canada, which has traditionally taken a progressive approach to refugee resettlement. The affordable-housing crisis and climbing unemployment rate are fuelling this societal resistance toward bringing more migrants into the country.

Canada, though, cannot afford to be myopic about migration. Shutting our borders to newcomers would cause the national economy to collapse. A shortage of skilled labour is expected to worsen over the coming years. Credentialled refugees like Ms. Biry could help fill that talent gap.

That’s why it is up to our business leaders to set the record straight. Executives and corporate directors can succeed where governments have failed: dispelling myths and ensuring that migration policy is aligned with business needs.

“They benefit when migration is well managed,” Amy Pope, director-general of the International Organization for Migration (IOM), said in an interview. Geneva-based IOM is an intergovernmental organization that is part of the UN system. “They can make the case in ways that the UN or civil society can’t.”

Ms. Pope, who previously served as senior adviser on migration to U.S. President Joe Biden and as deputy homeland security adviser to former president Barack Obama, took the helm at IOM last October. Her mandate includes building more private-sector partnerships to better manage migration in countries around the world.

Her office already has buy-in from large multinational corporations. Some provide donor support. Airbnb ABNB-Q, for instance, offered housing for Ukrainian refugees fleeing the war. Others lend their expertise: Amazon AMZN-Q is supporting the prepositioning of supplies for humanitarian responses. Companies like Walmart WMT-N, meanwhile, focus on hiring displaced workers, she said.

IOM is also fielding hiring inquiries from businesses that operate in Canada. During a recent trip to Toronto, Ms. Pope participated in a corporate roundtable discussion that included representatives of more than 25 companies.

Some of those businesses, including Saint-Gobain, Colas, Purolator, Lafarge and Fragomen, are already participating in a new partnership launched by the France Canada Chamber of Commerce (Ontario), or FCCCO, this past February.

Project Starfish – the initiative’s name is a nod to returning stranded starfish to the sea – is working with the IOM to provide companies with access to globally displaced talent. Migrants, meanwhile, benefit from job opportunities that allow them to immediately contribute to the Canadian economy. The workers, who originally hail from Djibouti, Costa Rica and Mexico, only arrive in Canada after securing a job and a work permit.

“Virtual Interviews and recruitments are ongoing by companies,” said Riva Walia, founding managing director of FCCCO, adding that 52 candidates were being considered for various jobs as of last week.

Ms. Walia and Sanjay Tugnait, president and chief executive of Fairfax Digital Services, are also conducting a roadshow to solicit more corporate participation in Project Starfish.

“Canada is the best in class when it comes to matching work force needs with a migration policy,” Ms. Pope said. “And that gives Canada a competitive edge compared to other countries. That will become more and more relevant as we see these demographic trends become more and more acute.”

Still, Canada could do more to enhance protections for migrant workers who are vulnerable to exploitation and create additional employment programs in a variety of economic sectors.

“There’s a housing shortage, you need construction workers to build the houses. But the mechanisms for attracting that less skilled labour aren’t there in the same way that they are for agriculture,” she said.

Ms. Pope said politicians that focus too much on border enforcement are missing the bigger picture: “The danger of that is it could harm the economic development and prosperity of countries that need migration for their future.”

She added: “Half the world is voting this year. Migrants don’t vote. It’s very, very easy to lay all of the problems that a society has at the feet of migrants.”

It is a sentiment echoed by Ms. Biry, who rightly points out that refugees are often educated professionals with international work experience and language skills.

Frankly, after overcoming unimaginable hardships, many, including Ms. Biry, have an unmatched work ethic, too. Pigeonholing refugees as unskilled labour does a disservice to migrants and Canada alike.

“Sometimes refugees can do things even Canadians cannot do,” Ms. Biry said. “We can be mentors. We can learn something and teach something, too.”","A woman stands on a city sidewalk, wearing a blue t-shirt with the word 'love' partially visible, in front of a modern building with large windows.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x149 at 0x7D6BA22E22C0>,2024-07-12 11:00:00+00:00,https://www.theglobeandmail.com,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-business-acumen-is-the-antidote-to-the-political-backlash-against/,['Politics' 'Opinion/Editorial' 'Business and Finance'],[0.9 0.9 0.6],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/b22c0ebaf7.png
a499c7ea2b,Forbes,Presidential Odds Shakeup As Kamala Harris Now Leading Democratic Challenger To Donald Trump - Forbes,"It’s ‘game on’ in the U.S. presidential race with Vice President Kamala Harris the new leading challenger to Donald Trump after President Joe Biden dropped out on Sunday. But beyond the daily drama, conspiracy theories, chaos, controversies and continued chase to the White House and presidency, the betting markets are providing fascinating fodder and entertainment with millions of dollars wagered on the elections.

What To Know About Kamala Harris’ Record

While political fans and bettors are unable to place legal bets in the U.S. on the presidential election at the top online sportsbooks, offshore betting sites continue to take bets and brace for more massive wagering on the 2024 presidential election between Donald Trump and now likely Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.

U.S. President Odds

Political odds are subject to change and are updated in real-time by BetOnline for President and Democratic Vice President.

Donald Trump is currently a -200 favorite to be the next U.S. President with Kamala Harris a +200, or 2/1 underdog.

On June 26, just before the Trump-Biden presidential debate, Trump’s odds to become the 47th President of the United States were -120, and then bet up again to -150 as the “high level of interest and wagering” continued, said BetOnline.ag sportsbook manager Adam Burns.

This past Thursday, July 18, BetOnline sportsbook brand marketing manager Dave Mason appeared on the WagerTalk podcast. He provided the updated odds to win the presidential election along with adjustments from the day before. And they were significant on Harris and Biden, with pressure mounting for Joe Biden to pull out of the presidential race.

-250: Donald Trump (down from -300)

+280: Kamala Harris (down from +1200, or 12/1)

+850: Joe Biden (up from +325)

“I hate politics, but this is fascinating, and the betting makes it more entertaining and fun,” Mason said. “I’m paying attention to it non-stop.”

Kamala Harris And Running Mate Odds

“We’re getting just as much if not more action on the Democratic nominee the last few weeks than the presidential election,” Mason said.

Harris went from -110 to -170 favorite, and she was +800 the day before on July 17. Now Harris is the heavy -900 favorite (1/9 odds) with Biden’s announcement that he’s out of the presidential race and endorsing Harris to be the next Democratic nominee ahead of Michelle Obama (+1600), Gavin Newsom (+1800), Hillary Clinton (+2000) and Gretchen Whitmer (+2800).

“It’s a huge betting market, and we offer as much as possible,” Mason said on the various presidential and election markets.

The newest market is odds to be Kamala Harris’ running mate. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has emerged as the front-runner to join Harris on the Democratic ticket should she be the party's presidential nominee. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper is a leading candidate along with Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear.

The odds were released July 21 shortly after Biden withdrew.

Josh Shapiro (7/4)

Roy Cooper (3/1)

Andy Beshear (5/1)

Mark Kelly (8/1)

Pete Buttigieg (8/1)

Gretchen Whitmer (16/1)

Michelle Obama (20/1)

Others: Tim Walz (25/1), Gavin Newsom (28/1), Wes Moore (40/1), Hillary Clinton (50/1), Raphael Warnock (50/1), J.B. Pritzker (80/1). For additional entertainment, George Clooney (100/1), Nick Saban (250/1) and Oprah Winfrey (250/1) are listed as potential running mates.

“Harris is a big loss, and Biden a huge loss,” Mason said Thursday of the sportsbooks liability. “Trump is actually a huge win for us,” he added, “but I think that will change.”

Now with Biden out of the race, the betting market and interest will grow and reach a crescendo ahead of the next presidential debate scheduled for Sept. 10, and further leading into the Nov. 4 presidential election.

The interest in the presidential and related elections draws more eyeballs and media coverage when there is added controversy, trash talk and heated rivalries. Just like in sports with the Yankees-Red Sox, Ohio State-Michigan and biggest NFL rivalries and matchups taking bigger betting action.

How Kamala Harris Performs In Polls Against Trump

The political betting interest on the presidential election is massive, and it will be entertaining and engaging to watch the debates, polls and voting play out with so much at stake.

Kamala Harris released a statement following Biden's withdrawal and welcomed his endorsement, writing, ""I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party—and unite our nation—to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda. We have 107 days until Election Day. Together, we will fight. And together, we will win.""

Polls and money wagered thus far are not betting on it.

a36c2b44d1,Financial Times,"Boeing guilty plea to fraud unlikely to hit shares or credit rating, say analysts - Financial Times","Boeing’s guilty plea to a fraud charge is unlikely to affect the company’s stock price, credit rating or revenue from the US government, analysts have predicted.

The aerospace manufacturer said on Sunday it had reached an agreement in principle with the US Department of Justice to plead guilty to one count of defrauding the US government after it misled aviation regulators about flight control software that caused two fatal crashes of the 737 Max.

The plea deal fines Boeing about $487mn, of which it has already paid half. It also demands the company plough $455mn into safety and compliance programmes overseen by an independent monitor.

“The problem is this settlement gives you the idea that justice can be bought — and bought very cheaply,” said Pratap Chatterjee, executive director of watchdog group CorpWatch.

The agreement continues a justice department pattern of seeking increasingly aggressive financial penalties in corporate criminal cases over the past 15 years, yet underscores the difficulty of handing out meaningful consequences for companies that earn billions.

Boeing’s stock ended at $185.84 on Monday, up $1.01 from the close on Friday.

Boeing declined to comment.

Lawyers who specialise in government contracting also said Boeing was unlikely to lose its ability to supply the Pentagon, despite rules that can bar companies with criminal records from doing business with the US government.

Boeing supplies critical military aircraft, including the F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet, the AH-64 Apache helicopter and the KC-46 refuelling tanker, as well as its prestige project, the US president’s Air Force One. Though Boeing’s defence business has failed to turn a full-year profit since 2021, it remains a critical source of revenue.

The government can grant waivers to allow contractors with a record to continue as suppliers. Paul Seidman, a partner at the boutique government contracting law firm Seidman & Associates, said the rules demanded that a contractor showed they had taken steps to fix their problems.

“It would be unusual for a large firm like Boeing to be [suspended or disbarred] because they’re essential to the defence, and there’s a limited number of competitors,” he said.

The cost of the US Department of Defense finding another contractor seems “prohibitive”, said Moody’s credit rating analyst Jonathan Root. At the same time, the criminal penalty the justice department is levying is “very manageable for the company”.

All three credit rating agencies have rated Boeing one notch about junk, with a negative outlook. But the speed at which the manufacturer produces aeroplanes counts more towards whether Boeing maintains its investment-grade rating than other factors.

“The dollar amount of the fine is of a size that is not material to our view of the credit profile,” he said.

The justice department has been increasingly willing since the 2008 financial crisis to prosecute corporations, said Brandon Garrett, a professor at Duke University’s law school who established an online database tracking corporate prosecutions.

In 2012, BP pleaded guilty to manslaughter and environmental crimes following the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. Two years later prosecutors required BNP Paribas to plead guilty to violating sanctions against Iran, Sudan and Cuba, and in 2020, the Malaysian subsidiary to Goldman Sachs pleaded guilty to violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the 1MDB bribery scandal.

There is no guarantee that spending more on compliance will fix Boeing’s quality problems, Garrett said, or that the limited information the monitor will make public will be enough to understand what led to the company’s failures. Still, the plea deal represents a step up in enforcement, because prosecutors are forcing a plea rather than simply extending the deferred prosecution agreement.","A group of people are gathered around a pile of debris, which appears to be the wreckage of a plane, in a desert-like environment.

20185aa7e2,CBC.ca,Cleanup at former Vulcan Iron Works site begins after province lifts stop-work order - CBC.ca,"The cleanup of a burned-out Winnipeg industrial site has begun after the property owner agreed to a provincial order for a wet demolition following months of negotiations.

The massive Vulcan Iron Works warehouse on Sutherland Avenue in Point Douglas was destroyed in a fire last July, and there have been multiple fires at the property since then.

The City of Winnipeg ordered owner Sheldon Blank to clean up the property by Dec. 4, 2023, but he appealed that order.

He argued he couldn't proceed with the demolition because the provincial government had ordered a wet demolition, a process that involves soaking the debris in order to prevent the spread of asbestos, at a significant additional cost.

Blank said his testing had found no asbestos and a wet demolition couldn't be conducted in winter.

""We're trying to comply and of course for me personally, it's been very, very expensive, as I've had no insurance on the loss,"" Blank said in an interview.

""So [the loss is] mine to bear, as is the demolition cost … I have no insurance to assist me.""

Blank agreed to the wet demolition and crews began preparing the site for demolition last week, but provincial workplace health and safety officials again put a stop to the work on Tuesday.

Blank said paperwork had not been properly submitted, but workplace safety officials visited the site again on Thursday and gave him permission to resume the work.

An excavator moved debris into piles while workers in hazardous materials equipment hosed it down.

City council's property and development committee adjourned a hearing on Blank's appeal of the cleanup order, after he asked to amend the order to allow the eastern portion of the structure to remain.

The hearing was rescheduled to June 17.

Blank says he has confirmed with the city that he can keep part of the building.

Property and development chair Coun. Sherri Rollins (Fort Rouge-East Fort Garry) said she couldn't comment on the matter because the hearing is still open.

Mayor Scott Gillingham says the city and province need to work together to find ways of speeding up demolitions.

""I've talked consistently about the fact that we have too many derelict properties in the city of Winnipeg, we have too much neighbourhood blight,"" he told reporters at city hall on Thursday.

""We have too many piles of rubble still around the city of Winnipeg. Property owners are responsible for their property.""

He says he has had discussions with Premier Wab Kinew about ways the two levels of government can work together, but no concrete proposals have been made.

Blank says he wants the work done as soon as possible.

""It's quite a large building and it's not going to happen overnight. It's going to take some time. Of course the height makes it dangerous and that has to be done carefully.""

Blank says next week, cranes will be brought in to tear down the steel superstructure of the building.

He hopes to have the entire site cleaned up within 60 days.","A construction worker in a safety vest and hard hat is seen using a shovel at a demolition site, with a large orange excavator in the background and a 'KEEP OUT DEMOLITION AREA ANDERSON' sign in the foreground.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BDA793580>,2024-05-30 23:06:00+00:00,https://www.cbc.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/vulcan-iron-works-cleanup-begins-1.7220164,['Local/Regional' 'Weather and Environment'],[0.95 0.7 ],Unlikely,Unlikely,sample_review/images/20185aa7e2.png

Three years ago, authorities bin send Zuma to jail afta e dey found for contempt of court sake of e no gree give evidence and testify for one judicial investigation of corruption during im nine-year term as president.

Im arrest for July 2021 bin cause di deadliest riots since South Africa transition to democracy, e bin cause di deaths of more dan 300 pipo.

Celebrity status

Just few weeks ago, e be like Zuma once again dey down on im luck afta e dey legally barred from standing as member of parliament due sake of im criminal conviction.

However, dis setback no stop im party from ogbonge performance for polls. E be like say voters no dey put off as dem see Zuma face for di side symbol of im party for ballot papers.

Wit courage of dis performance, Zuma bin come out wit fight.

“Nobody must declare results, no provoke us, no start trouble,” Zuma bin tok for di eve of di final election result for wetin look like veiled threat wey dey target di kontri Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), afta MK and twenty-five oda opposition parties bin accuse di IEC of vote rigging.

Despite say MK receive di highest number of votes for Zuma home province of Kwa-Zulu Natal and come third nationally, di party claim say di elections no dey free or credible.

Di IEC don strongly deny dis allegations.

Zuma unexpected and dramatic arrival for di elections results centre for Johannesburg on Saturday night - for di eve of di announcement of di official results - bin bring di building to standstill, as if one Amapiano or Afropop Idol dey waka to di stage.

Im comeback don win respect from former allies and even current rivals from di ANC party.

“Jacob Zuma na one force to rate for di South African politics…we neva underestimate am,” ANC Secretary General Fikile Mbalula, as e reflect on im own party weak electoral performance.

ANC ties

Despite im suspension from di ANC, Zuma remain one member of di party wey bring end to apartheid for South Africa.

Wen e bin launch new MK party for December, Zuma declare say e go always be ANC member. But same time, e bin ask ANC supporters to turn away from di party.

Zuma popularity no doubt dey cause sleepless nights for di ANC.

Di ties between di party and Zuma go back to wen e bi one illegal organisation under di segregationist system. Wit no formal schooling and modest upbringing, Zuma anti-apartheid activism bin later see am to jail for ten years on Robben Island along wit Nelson Mandela.

Afta di ban against di ANC dey lifted by di apartheid goment for 1990, Zuma bin return from exile and rise through di political ranks. For 1999 dey appointed deputy president of di kontri.

Zuma ability to connect wit di poor and marginalised for South Africa society na wetin set am apart from most politicians. Im acquittal on rape charges bin lead to one of di most controversial leadership battles for di history of di ANC.

For 2005, one judge bin tok say corruption and racketeering charges against Zuma bin show proof of political influence by former president Thabo Mbeki or im supporters.

1e35a77798,Reuters,How Hezbollah is trying to counter Israel's high-tech surveillance - Reuters,"BEIRUT, July 9 (Reuters) - Coded messages. Landline phones. Pagers. Following the killing of senior commanders in targeted Israeli airstrikes, the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group, Hezbollah, has been using some low-tech strategies to try to evade its foe's sophisticated surveillance technology, informed sources told Reuters.

It has also been using its own tech – drones – to study and attack Israel's intelligence gathering capabilities in what Hezbollah's leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, has described as a strategy of ""blinding"" Israel.

The sides have been trading fire since Hezbollah's Palestinian ally in the Gaza Strip, Hamas, went to war with Israel in October. While the fighting on Lebanon's southern border has remained relatively contained, stepped-up attacks in recent weeks have intensified concern it could spiral into a full-scale war.

Tens of thousands of people have fled both sides of the border. Israeli strikes have killed more than 330 Hezbollah fighters and around 90 civilians in Lebanon, according to Reuters tallies. Israel says attacks from Lebanon have killed 21 soldiers and 10 civilians.

Many of Hezbollah's casualties were killed while participating in the near-daily hostilities, including launching rockets and explosive drones into northern Israel.

Hezbollah has also confirmed the deaths of more than 20 operatives - including three top commanders, members of its elite Radwan special forces unit and intelligence operatives - in targeted strikes away from the frontlines.

Israel's military said it was responding to an unprovoked attack from Hezbollah, which began firing at Israeli targets the day after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement to Reuters that they were striking military targets and taking ""feasible precautions in order to mitigate harm to civilians.""

""The success of these efforts hinges on the IDF's ability to gather thorough and precise intelligence on Hezbollah's forces, its leaders, the organization's terrorist infrastructure, their whereabouts and operations,"" the statement said.

The IDF did not answer questions about its intelligence gathering and Hezbollah's countermeasures, citing ""reasons of intelligence security"".

As domestic pressure builds in Israel over Hezbollah's barrages, the IDF has highlighted its ability to hit the group's operatives across the border.

On a tour of Israel’s Northern Command, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant pointed to pictures of what he said were slain Hezbollah commanders and said 320 “terrorists” had been killed as of May 29, including senior operatives.

Electronic surveillance technology plays a vital role in these strikes. The IDF has said it has security cameras and remote sensing systems trained on areas where Hezbollah operates, and it regularly sends surveillance drones over the border to spy on its adversary.

Israel's electronic eavesdropping - including hacking into cell phones and computers - is also widely regarded as among the world's most sophisticated.

Hezbollah has learned from its losses and adapted its tactics in response, six sources familiar with the group’s operations told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive security matters.

Cell phones, which can be used to track a user's location, have been banned from the battlefield in favour of more old-fashioned communication means, including pagers and couriers who deliver verbal messages in person, two of the sources said.

Hezbollah has also been using a private, fixed-line telecommunications network dating back to the early 2000s, three sources said.

In case conversations are overheard, code words are used for weapons and meeting sites, according to another source familiar with the group's logistics. These are updated nearly daily and delivered to units via couriers, the source said.

""We're facing a battle in which information and technology are essential parts,"" said Qassem Kassir, a Lebanese analyst close to Hezbollah. ""But when you face certain technological advances, you need to go back to the old methods - the phones, the in-person communications … whatever method allows you to circumvent the technology.""

Hezbollah's media office said it had no comment on the sources' assertions.

LOW-TECH COUNTERMEASURES

Security experts say some low-tech countermeasures can be quite effective against high-tech spying. One of the ways that al Qaeda's late leader, Osama bin Laden, evaded capture for nearly a decade was by disconnecting from the internet and phone services, and using couriers instead.

""The simple act of using a VPN (virtual private network), or better yet, not using a cell phone at all, can make it much harder to find and fix a target,"" said Emily Harding, a former CIA analyst now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington.

""But these countermeasures also make Hezbollah's leadership far less effective at communicating rapidly with their troops.""

Hezbollah and Lebanese security officials believe Israel has also been tapping local informants as it zeroes in on targets. Lebanon's economic crisis and rivalries between political factions have created opportunities for Israeli recruiters, but not all informants realize who they are speaking with, three sources said.

On Nov. 22, a woman from south Lebanon received a call on her cell phone from a person claiming to be a local official, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the incident. Speaking in flawless Arabic, the caller asked whether the family was home, the sources said. No, the woman replied, explaining they had travelled to eastern Lebanon.

Minutes later, a missile slammed into the woman's home in the village of Beit Yahoun, killing five Hezbollah fighters including Abbas Raad, the son of a senior Hezbollah lawmaker and a Radwan member, the sources said.

Hezbollah believes Israel had tracked the fighters to the location and placed the call to confirm whether there were civilians present before launching the strike, they told Reuters without disclosing further details.

Israel's military said at the time that it struck a number of Hezbollah targets that day, including a ""terrorist cell"".

Within weeks, Hezbollah was publicly warning supporters via the affiliated Al-Nour radio station not to trust cold callers claiming to be local officials or aid workers, saying Israelis were impersonating them to identify houses being used by Hezbollah.

It was the first of a series of strikes targetting key Hezbollah operatives in Lebanon. Others killed include Wissam al-Tawil, Taleb Abdallah and Mohammed Nasser, commanders who played leading roles directing Hezbollah's operations in the south. Saleh al-Arouri, deputy head of Hamas, was also killed while attending a meeting in the capital, Beirut.

Hezbollah began suspecting that Israel was targeting its fighters by tracking their cell phones and monitoring video feeds from security cameras installed on buildings in border communities, two sources familiar with the group's thinking and a Lebanese intelligence official told Reuters.

On Dec. 28, Hezbollah urged southern residents in a statement distributed via its Telegram channel to disconnect any security cameras they own from the internet.

By early February, another directive had been issued to Hezbollah's fighters: no mobile phones anywhere near the battlefield.

""Today, if anyone is found with their phone on the front, he is kicked out of Hezbollah,"" said a senior Lebanese source familiar with the group’s operations.

Three other sources confirmed the order. Fighters began leaving their phones behind when they carried out operations, one told Reuters. Another, the Lebanese intelligence official, said Hezbollah would sometimes perform surprise checks on field units to see if members had phones on them.

Even in Beirut, senior Hezbollah politicians avoid bringing phones with them to meetings, two other sources said.

In a televised speech on Feb. 13, Nasrallah warned supporters that their phones were more dangerous than Israeli spies, saying they should break, bury or lock them in an iron box.

Hezbollah has also taken steps to secure its private telephone network following a suspected breach by Israel, according to a former Lebanese security official and two other sources familiar with Hezbollah's operations.

The vast network, allegedly financed by Iran, was set up around two decades ago with fibre optic cables extending from Hezbollah's strongholds in Beirut's southern suburbs to towns in south Lebanon and east into the Bekaa Valley, according to government officials at the time.

The sources declined to say when or how it had been penetrated. But they said Hezbollah telecommunications specialists were breaking it into smaller networks to limit the damage if it is breached again.

""We often change our landline networks and switch them up, so that we can outrun the hacking and infiltration,"" the senior source told Reuters.

DRONE SURVEILLANCE

The group has also been touting its ability to collect its own intelligence on enemy targets and attack Israel's surveillance installations using its arsenal of small, homemade, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

On June 18, Hezbollah published a nine-minute excerpt of what it said was video gathered by its surveillance aircraft over the Israeli city of Haifa, including military installations and port facilities. The Israeli Air Force said air defense systems had detected the drone, but a decision was made not to intercept it because it had no offensive capabilities, and doing so could endanger residents.

Another video released by Hezbollah included aerial pictures it said it had collected of a massive Israeli observation balloon known as Sky Dew on the day before it was hit in a May 15 drone attack.

Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the images. But IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said at the time that the airship, used to detect incoming rockets, was hit while on the ground at a military base in northern Israel. He said there were no casualties and no impact on the military’s ""aerial situational awareness capability"" in the area.

Hezbollah says it has also shot down or taken control of half a dozen Israeli surveillance drones, including Hermes 450, Hermes 900 and SkyLark UAVs. Hezbollah operatives disassemble the drones to study their components, according to two of the sources.

Israel has confirmed that five air force drones were downed by surface-to-air missiles while operating over Lebanon.

However, the IDF said Hezbollah's declarations ""should be noted with reservation,"" saying the group aims to instil fear in Israelis.

Nicholas Blanford, a Beirut-based security consultant who has written a history of Hezbollah, said the group's ""awareness and wariness"" of security breaches was at an all-time high.

""Hezbollah has had to tighten up its security far more than it needed to do in earlier conflicts,"" he told Reuters.

Israel retains a technological advantage, however, Blanford said.

On the afternoon of July 3, a car driving through a Lebanese coastal village more than 20 km (12 miles) north of the Israeli border burst into flames, witnesses said.

The Israeli military said it had eliminated Nasser, who it said commanded a unit that is attacking Israel from southwestern Lebanon. His death came less than a month after the strike that killed Abdallah, who commanded operations in the central region of the southern border strip.

Hezbollah acknowledging both killings and in response launched some of its biggest barrages to date into northern Israel.

edbaaa72cc,The Guardian,Assisted dying bill to be introduced into House of Lords - The Guardian,"Keir Starmer is under pressure to fulfil a promise to allow a parliamentary vote on legalising assisted dying as a bill is to be introduced into the House of Lords on Friday.

Lord Falconer, who was lord chancellor in Tony Blair’s government, will propose a private member’s bill to allow assisted dying for terminally ill adults after coming second in a ballot of peers last week.

In March, Starmer said he was in favour of changing the law. He promised Esther Rantzen, the television presenter who has terminal cancer and is campaigning for assisted dying, that if he became prime minister he would ensure parliamentary time to debate the issue and allow a free vote. He repeated the pledge after winning the general election.

But some advocates for a change in the law fear that the prime minister may decide to wait for a private member’s bill to be introduced in the Commons. A ballot of MPs is due to be held in September.

Starmer was committed to ensuring parliamentary time for a bill on assisted dying, said Falconer. But a Commons bill was a “much more certain route” than a bill originating in the Lords.

There were “a number of MPs who are keen to take this issue forward” if they were successful in a ballot, he told the Guardian. “It’s a significant social reform and it has a really good chance of success. It would be a bill for which an MP would be remembered. It might not be my bill, but I just want to get this through. And there is a sense now that the stars are aligned and a bill will get through one way or another.”

Falconer’s bill would allow terminally ill, mentally competent adults to have the option of assisted dying alongside access to high-quality end-of-life care. The individual would need to meet strict eligibility criteria, be assessed by two independent doctors, and self-administer the medication if their request was approved.

Some campaigners have criticised the bill for limiting assisted dying to terminally ill patients rather than extending the option to people with incurable conditions such as multiple sclerosis or locked-in syndrome.

Falconer said: “My bill is designed for people who will die in the near future. I don’t think the state should be helping people who are not terminally ill to take their own lives.”

At the moment, assisting someone to end their life is a criminal offence in England and Wales, carrying a maximum prison sentence of up to 14 years.

Moves to legalise assisted dying are under way in Scotland, the Isle of Man and Jersey.

The issue was last put to a vote in the Commons in 2015, when a motion on legalisation was defeated by 330 votes to 118. However, there has been a marked shift in opinion among MPs since then, and the recent general election may have produced a Commons majority in favour of a change in the law.

Public opinion polls have consistently shown a majority of people in favour of legalising assisted dying. A survey of 10,000 people in March found 75% backed assisted dying, with 14% opposed.

Sarah Wootton, the chief executive of Dignity in Dying, said: “Assisted dying is a movement whose time has come. The prime minister has doubled down on his promise to make time for this debate and dying people will be holding him to account; they simply do not have time to wait. As reform grows closer in the Isle of Man, Jersey and Scotland, we are on the brink of historic change across the British Isles.”

A bill to allow assisted dying passed its third reading in the Isle of Man’s legislature, the House of Keys, this week. It will now move to the upper house, which cannot block the bill but may amend it.

The bill permits assisted dying for terminally ill, mentally competent people who have lived in the Isle of Man for at least five years.","An older man with a white beard and glasses is wearing a dark suit and a red tie with a pattern, standing in front of a blurred background that suggests a formal setting.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x118 at 0x7D6BA3A66740>,2024-07-26 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com,https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/26/assisted-dying-bill-to-be-introduced-into-house-of-lords,['Politics' 'National'],[0.9 0.7],Unlikely,Likely,sample_review/images/edbaaa72cc.png
9a29e6443b,ABC News,Multiple deaths reported as police clash with anti-tax protesters in Kenya - ABC News,"LONDON -- Police allegedly fired live ammunition at anti-government protesters in Kenya's capital on Tuesday, as thousands of people demonstrated against proposed tax hikes in the East African nation.

At least five people were shot dead during Tuesday's clashes between police and protesters in Nairobi, according to Amnesty International. Another 31 people were injured, the organization said. There were also 52 arrests, per Amnesty International.

Images and videos circulating online purportedly show several protesters with bullet wounds in the Kenyan capital.

Kenya announced the country's armed forces were responding ""in support of the National Police Service in response to the security emergency caused by the ongoing violent protests in various parts of the Republic of Kenya resulting in destruction and breaching of critical infrastructure.""

The Kenya Human Rights Commission posted video on the social media platform X showing police shooting at protesters as they marched near Nairobi City Hall. The watchdog body said its staff witnessed at least one protester die from the gunshots.

""We strongly condemn the police killing,"" the Kenya Human Rights Commission wrote in a post on X. ""Such actions are unacceptable and constitute a grave violation of human rights. Justice and accountability are imperative. We will vigorously push for police accountability.""

Scores of protesters were seen breaching the complex housing Kenya's Parliament, where lawmakers had just voted to approve a contentious finance bill that raises some taxes. A section of the building was set on fire, forcing lawmakers to evacuate.

In a joint statement from embassies of several countries, including the United States, Netherlands and Germany, they said, ""We are deeply concerned by the violence witnessed in many parts of the country during the recent protests, and are especially shocked by the scenes witnessed outside the Kenyan Parliament. We regret the tragic loss of life and injuries sustained including by the use of live fire.""

The Biden administration has cultivated a close relationship with Kenyan President William Ruto, naming the country a major non-NATO ally and honoring Ruto with a state visit just last month.

""We condemn the violence reported during protests in Nairobi and around Kenya,"" State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said, reading from a statement at a briefing Tuesday. ""We mourn the loss of life and injuries sustained and offer our condolences to the families who lost loved ones. We urge restraint to restore order and provide space for dialogue.""

The demonstrations have also been taking place nationwide, including in Ruto's hometown of Eldoret.

At least 12 people have been allegedly abducted or have forcibly disappeared in connection to the ongoing protests, according to Kenya's Police Reforms Working Group. The abductions reportedly occurred over the past five days, intensifying on Monday. In a statement posted on X, Kenyan Chief Justice Martha Koome said the reports of protesters being abducted are of ""deep concern"" and a ""direct assault on the rule of law.""

Several notable Kenyan figures have joined in the nationwide demonstrations, including former U.S. President Barack Obama's half-sister, Auma Obama, who was among those protesting in Nairobi on Tuesday. Auma Obama, 64, was with a group of protesters being interviewed by CNN on a live broadcast when they were apparently tear-gassed.

The controversial legislation in question is aimed at raising $2.7 billion in revenue to alleviate debt and reduce borrowing. But critics argue corruption and greed at the hands of Kenya's politicians have stolen money from the economy and that ordinary people should not be the ones to pay the price.

Following protests last Tuesday, Ruto's office announced they made amendments to the bill ""in account of the views of the people and other stakeholders during public participation sessions.""",A man holding a Kenyan flag is running away from tear gas while another man holds a flag.

a74a15d755,POLITICO,The ‘absolute explosion’ of foreign interference in U.S. politics - POLITICO,"UNDER THE TABLE — The trial of Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) includes all kinds of sordid details — with Menendez accused of taking a luxury car and gold, among other gifts, in return for allegedly divulging sensitive information about U.S. policy towards Egypt and U.S. diplomats in Cairo.

But New Jersey’s senior Senator is also only the latest in a growing number of lawmakers and government officials who have been accused of an illegal relationship with a foreign entity. Just this May, Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) was indicted for allegedly accepting $600,000 in bribes from an oil and gas company based in Azerbaijan and a bank in Mexico. In exchange, Cuellar allegedly agreed to influence U.S. policy in favor of Azerbaijan and pressure Executive Branch officials on measures that would be beneficial to the bank.

The FBI and Manhattan prosecutors are also probing whether a construction company with ties to the Turkish government improperly raised money for New York City Mayor Eric Adams’ 2021 mayoral campaign.

Dating back to the Trump administration, multiple officials were accused of improper relationships with foreign countries; former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort ultimately pled guilty to failing to register as a foreign agent of the government of Ukraine.

So what’s behind this surge of foreign cash allegedly influencing U.S. politics? Are public officials simply getting more brazen in their interactions with foreign governments? According to Casey Michel, author of the upcoming book Foreign Agents: How American Lobbyists and Lawmakers Threaten Democracy Around the World, illegal foreign influence has been entrenched in our political system for decades — but it’s happening now more than ever.

Foreign lobbying of all sorts is a big business in the U.S., with countries and other entities spending over $5 trillion since 2016 to influence U.S. policy and burnish their own images. And despite bipartisan interest, attempts at reform have largely stalled out thus far.

Now, though, a confluence of factors including the Justice Department getting more aggressive on the issue, have led to this recent series of high-profile indictments. To better understand how foreign actors influence our politics and what their own goals are, Nightly spoke with Michel. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Are we seeing an uptick in foreign interference in our politics through lobbying? And if so, why is that the case?

We have seen an absolute explosion in recent years in terms of the scope and the scale of both foreign lobbying as well as foreign interference — without any kind of precedent in American history itself. And that’s for a few reasons: You had folks in Washington asleep at the wheel as it pertained to both the regulations and even the potential threat to these kinds of unchecked foreign lobbying. On the ground, there was a proliferation of Americans willing to provide foreign lobbying services beyond just traditional lobbying to authoritarian regimes, who were realizing just how wide open Washington was. It was really in the mid-2010s when things began to shift. And finally, folks started paying attention and realizing what the cost of ignoring these networks for so many years truly was.

Foreign lobbyists and the industry itself had blossomed around Washington to no longer include even just traditional lobbyists themselves, but now include things like PR shops, consultancies and law firms.

In your book, you point to the Trump administration as a turning point for foreign lobbying. Why is that?

In American history, we’ve never seen a figure like Trump who had nearly as many foreign financial entanglements and relations with foreign governments — especially authoritarian governments — that have proven themselves more than willing to use that relationship for their own benefit. Russian interference in the 2016 campaign has seen plenty of ink spilled about it. But it was by no means limited to Russia. It’s Saudi financing of the Trump Organization, the Trump family, especially Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law. It is Emirati financing in similar networks. It is investment partnerships from figures in places like Azerbaijan or Kazakhstan. It is seeing officials from places like Nigeria or Malaysia directly patronizing Trump hotels. Again, all of this is helping to bankroll former President Donald Trump himself.

The other element is, ironically it was the Trump administration that didn’t focus necessarily on the traditional lobbying shops themselves, but actually turned its focus on American think tanks and American universities as these centers of foreign lobbying networks. It wasn’t until the Trump years and a congressional and then Department of Education investigation that there were billions of dollars — six and a half billion dollars — discovered in undisclosed donations. The credit goes not to Trump, the president, but to his administration.

Which countries have we seen ramping up their foreign lobbying to the U.S.?

In recent years Russia has gotten plenty of headlines. But this has been extending to authoritarian regime after authoritarian regime around the world. Certainly, China has some of the deepest pockets involved, and there are plenty of law firms and lobbying firms that have worked on behalf of the regime in Beijing. We’ve also seen that extending into large-scale donations to universities that can then transform into mouthpieces for Chinese talking points. But certainly in recent years, especially, we have seen an explosion in terms of total financing for foreign lobbyists from Gulf dictatorships — especially like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In the Emirati case, they’ve really pioneered the hiring of not only former elected officials but also military officials, to then act as lobbyists on their behalf.

What about Turkey, which has been making headlines because of its connection to Mayor Eric Adams and most recently Rep. Jamaal Bowman?

It does seem like they are ramping up. I think Turkey is an excellent case study in the fact that it’s not just these malign dictatorships in Moscow or Riyadh or Dubai that are using these networks. It’s also American allies. I mean, Turkey is obviously a NATO ally of the United States of America, but it is still engaging in these kinds of subterfuge, in terms of foreign lobbying and foreign interference. The Turkish government has been doing this for years and years. But it does seem like finally a lot of folks in Washington and elsewhere have woken up to the threats of and the realities of foreign lobbying.

I’m sure it is different by country, but what is the end game for many of these regimes? Influence? Reputation?

It is reputation laundering. It is whitewashing the images of these regimes themselves to try to transform them from being despotic, dictatorial governments that suppress basic freedoms and civil liberties for the population, and transforming them into benevolent autocracies that are transitioning into democracy and that are providing more and more rights for their citizens by the day.

It’s also gaining access to policymakers on the ground in places like Washington. Because at the end of the day, what is most important for these regimes is to make sure that American policy is implemented or is shifted for the benefit of those regimes themselves. These regimes want nothing more than to remain in power. They want nothing more than to continue enriching themselves and their inner circles and their family members.

This is why the case of Bob Menendez of New Jersey is so fascinating. He’s accused of conspiring to act as a foreign agent on behalf of the government in Cairo, Egypt. And that wasn’t just reputation laundering. That was directly accessing Bob Menendez, who has been the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to let the Egyptian government know what voting decisions were taking place, to pass along highly sensitive information, and to sway Menendez’s other colleagues in the Senate to make decisions that benefited the regime in Cairo.

What'd I Miss?

— FBI abruptly cancels Hill briefing on encryption: The FBI has abruptly canceled two large Hill briefings on encryption slated for this week, offering no explanation to the staffers invited, according to emails reviewed by POLITICO. Last week, the FBI invited congressional staff to two virtual briefings on “warrant-proof encryption,” slated for June 18 and June 20. Briefers would have discussed how encryption created challenges for the FBI’s work investigating “violent crimes against children and transnational organized crime,” according to the invitation. The briefings were the second in a series for all Hill staff on FBI “priority topics,” according to a copy of the invitation POLITICO reviewed. The first briefing in the series, held last month, focused on fentanyl.

— Education Department dings two schools for not protecting Jewish, Muslim students: The Education Department has determined that neither the University of Michigan nor the City University of New York properly responded or investigated certain reports of antisemitic and anti-Arab discrimination on their campuses after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel. Today’s “resolutions” are the first ones issued by the agency’s Office for Civil Rights in connection to incidents that occurred after the sweeping attacks by Hamas. But the Education Department avoided weighing in on specific protest rhetoric, including chants of “from the river to the sea” and “intifada,” that have been deemed antisemitic by Jewish groups and played a major role in congressional hearings about campus antisemitism.

— New Jersey AG charges Democratic power broker George Norcross in bombshell indictment: New Jersey’s attorney general today charged one of the state’s most powerful Democrats and his allies in a sweeping indictment alleging a long-running corruption scheme. The charges against businessperson and Democratic organizer George Norcross are groundbreaking. He has long been the subject of scrutiny by law enforcement and a political task force, but has never been charged. The indictment, brought by Attorney General Matt Platkin, portrays years of extortion and threats. According to the indictment, Norcross “led a criminal enterprise whose members and associates agreed the enterprise would extort others through threats and fear of economic and reputational harm and commit other criminal offenses to achieve the enterprise’s goals.”

Nightly Road to 2024

AD BLITZ — The Biden campaign announced today that they would be spending $50 million through the end of June on advertising, a significant blitz that includes their first ad that goes directly after former President Donald Trump’s felony conviction.

Biden’s campaign says it wants to more clearly define the choice between the candidates ahead of the first debate between them in Atlanta on June 27, reports The Associated Press.

ON THE SHORTLIST — Donald Trump Jr. is urging his dad to pick a “fighter” as his running mate, reports POLITICO. The elder Trump is locked in a general election that will be decided at the margins, where a candidate who could appeal to women or voters of color could boost his chances. And whomever he taps must muster the mettle to shine in a high-stakes vice presidential debate later this summer.

All of that is a tall order, but Trump has a long list of options. His campaign is vetting eight potential candidates: South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson.

Vance, Burgum and Rubio are in their own higher tier, according to multiple Trump allies granted anonymity to speak freely. But who’s up and who’s down seems to change by the week.

AROUND THE WORLD

CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC — A Russian court announced today it will hold the espionage trial of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich behind closed doors beginning in late June.

The 32-year-old American journalist has been detained in Russia for more than a year on allegations of spying for the CIA, a charge that the newspaper describes as “false and baseless.”

The Russian court detailed the charge in a statement today, saying that “Gershkovich, an American journalist for The Wall Street Journal, on the assignment of the CIA, collected secret information in the Sverdlovsk region on the activities of the defense enterprise JSC NPK Uralvagonzavod for the production and repair of military equipment.”

“The trial will be held behind closed doors. The first court hearing is scheduled for 26 June 2024,” the Sverdlovsk Regional Court said in the statement.

The Kremlin, meanwhile, said today that contacts had taken place with the United States over a possible prisoner exchange involving Gershkovich, Reuters reported.

TARGET PRACTICE — NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced today that more than 20 members of the transatlantic alliance will meet defense spending targets this year, a major issue as Republicans accuse European partners of not contributing their share to the common defense.

Speaking in Washington today, the Norwegian diplomat said he planned to inform President Joe Biden during their meeting later. The announcement comes four months after Stoltenberg projected 18 countries would meet the goal.

“This is good for Europe and good for America,” he said at an event hosted by the Wilson Center think tank.

RADAR SWEEP

BACK TO THE FUTURE — The writer John Ganz had grown up believing that his entire family had managed to escape the Holocaust. But in 2018, an old college professor of his discovered in a database that he had two relatives who did not make it out. One relative was jailed as a political prisoner in 1934 and then murdered at Auschwitz almost a decade later. This revelation set off a journey for Ganz — to acquire German citizenship and learn more about this side of his family’s history, which his older relatives never discussed. In Harper’s, he explores these topics and what it means to be connected to family.

e36194d687,Financial Times,Why Lithuania is considering sending soldiers to Ukraine - Financial Times,"Good morning.

Today, Lithuania’s prime minister tells my colleague why her country stands ready to put boots on the ground in Ukraine. And we have a dispatch from the student protests spreading across Europe and demanding that universities cut ties with Israel as it continues its attack on Gaza.

We’re taking a break until next week due to the Ascension bank holiday. Have a great (long) weekend.

At the ready

Lithuania is prepared to send its soldiers to Ukraine on a training mission, its prime minister told Andy Bounds.

Context: Lithuania, which declared independence from Moscow in 1990, wants to strengthen its military support for Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron has proposed sending European soldiers to Ukraine, though other countries have been wary of provoking a direct confrontation with Russia.

Ingrida Šimonytė told the FT she had parliamentary permission to send troops to Ukraine for training purposes — something her government has floated before — but that Kyiv had not yet asked for this.

Šimonytė acknowledged that Russia would consider it a provocation, but added: “If we just thought about the Russian response, then we could not send anything. Every second week you hear that somebody will be nuked.”

This week, Russia conducted drills with tactical nuclear weapons in response to Macron’s comments. Šimonytė doubted the weapons would be used, given the radioactive fallout would also hit Russia. “Most of the time the winds blow from west to east,” she noted drily.

According to Šimonytė, Russia has been intensifying attacks on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure such as power stations, schools and hospitals. “Russia is trying to provoke a new wave of people fleeing Ukraine because there are no basic utilities and no basic services,” the Lithuanian premier said.

The EU hosts more than 4.2mn refugees from Ukraine. But more than two years into the war, people in some European countries are growing critical of the support given to Ukrainians.

Šimonytė played down reports that Lithuania was helping return men of fighting age to Ukraine, which is desperately trying to recruit more soldiers. “We will not be arranging deportations, or looking for Ukrainian men in the country because this would not be legal,” Šimonytė said, adding that the EU has guaranteed them protection until March 2025.

However, those who Kyiv proves to have evaded military service might be denied permanent residence, Šimonytė said. She was “keen to help Ukraine, to ensure that it has the potential to renew its armed forces and to let people who have been fighting for a long time to rest”.

Chart du jour: Still hot

As we witness yet another spell of record temperatures — and unusually wet weather in parts of Europe — scientists warn of more extreme weather patterns globally, with heatwaves, droughts and flooding becoming more common.

Free universities

Student protests against Israel’s military operations in Gaza have spread to Europe, and as with every good occupation movement, the authorities are not exactly thrilled about the disruptions.

Context: The break-up of pro-Palestine protests at New York’s Columbia University that began last month has galvanised students across Europe, who are also calling for academic institutions to cut ties with Israel and take a stand in the ongoing conflict.

German police yesterday dispersed several dozen protesters who had set up camp at Berlin’s Freie Universität. The university filed charges for trespassing and vandalism, and Berlin’s higher education senator Ina Czyborra said that protests “which are aimed at confrontation” were not “legitimate”.

Next door in the Netherlands, police broke up a similar protest earlier that day at the University of Amsterdam, detaining several dozens of people. In Brussels, students have occupied a building of the French-speaking Free University, and police in France have repeatedly kicked out protesters from the famed Sciences Po Paris.

This has even drawn the attention of France’s upper echelons, with Prime Minister Gabriel Attal yesterday warning against “selective indignation” which “must stop on the part of those who always raise a voice against Israel, but who are voiceless in the face of Hamas and its abuses”.

In Ireland, students camping on the grounds of Trinity College Dublin have blocked access to the ancient Book of Kells manuscript stored there. Trinity said it is “in solidarity with the students in our horror at what is happening in Gaza” and was seeking to end investment in Israeli companies. But it has also fined the Trinity Students’ Union €214,000 for loss of revenue over the “disruptive” protests.

Camps and protests have also sprung up at universities in Austria, Finland, Denmark, Spain, Italy and the UK.

Lydia Polgreen: Kamala Harris ‘Does Very Well in Going Up Against Bullies’

I’m Lydia Polgreen, Opinion columnist for The New York Times. Like many of my colleagues, I think it’s time for Joe Biden to bow out. And I believe that the best person to replace him is Kamala Harris.

She didn’t make it that far in the primaries, and that might make you think: This is someone who has tried and failed to become president — why would she be good on the national stage? But I think it’s important to remember that running in the primaries and running for the general election are actually two very different things.

In the primaries, you’re essentially running against your peers — in many cases, your fellow politicians from your party — and you’re arguing with them over smaller differences than the big differences that separate our politics in this very polarized time. And where gender and race actually play a huge role in terms of how people are perceived and where the showing of emotion or anger or other feelings play very differently, depending on whether you’re a woman, depending on whether you’re a person of color — that primary environment, I think, is actually quite complicated.

Those same dynamics can be at play in a general election, as well, but they’re actually much different in this particular general election, because Donald Trump is a very particular kind of politician.

I think one of the things that makes Kamala Harris really compelling in this environment is that we’re dealing with a bully. And she is a person who does very well in going up against bullies. She has a demeanor, she has a way of speaking that very much comes from her experience as a prosecutor that plays very well when dealing with someone who really is kind of outside the bounds of the law.

One of the things that was most troubling about the debate between Biden and Trump was that, unsurprisingly, Trump just spouted lie after lie after lie, The thing that was so devastating was that Joe Biden just seemed completely unable to counter those lies. And it’s just impossible to imagine that Kamala Harris, who is really a very successful debater, wouldn’t be able to just methodically come in and counter, point for point, every single thing that came out of Donald Trump’s mouth.

The Biden administration has put Kamala Harris front and center on the messaging about abortion rights, and rightfully so. Everyone knows that Joe Biden is not a great messenger on this issue. He has had a long history of ambivalence about choice. He is a devout Catholic, and I think it’s fair to say he does not feel particularly comfortable speaking in strident terms about a woman’s right to choose.

That is not a problem for Kamala Harris. She is a lifelong believer and fighter for this cause and would be an eloquent and powerful spokesperson for the issue as the nominee, just as she has been on the campaign trail as part of the ticket.

I think there are really two separate questions we need to ask ourselves. One question is: Would Harris be a good nominee? I feel, based on what we’ve seen, that actually she could make a pretty compelling case for herself as a strong candidate. Then there’s another question, which is: Would she make a good president? And in an abstract world where we weren’t weighing her against Donald Trump, that’s an interesting conversation to have.

One of the criticisms of her when she was a primary candidate was that there wasn’t a clear and compelling reason that she could give for why she should be president. What was her vision? And I don’t think that she solved that problem. But I think it’s important to remember that circumstances dictate who the right person is at any given time.

What is the need of the hour? The need of the hour is to somehow find a way to ease Joe Biden out of the presidency, somehow find somebody to take on Donald Trump. And so for me, the case for Kamala Harris is that she is the right person for that first part of the job. Which is, frankly, the most important part of the job.

This is an existential crisis. We cannot survive another Trump administration. Preventing Trump from winning the presidency, I think, has to be the paramount goal. I’m not saying that I don’t think that Kamala Harris would be a good president. She might very well be a great president. I have no idea. But I don’t think that that’s a question that we, frankly, have the luxury to ask right now. Because we know that Donald Trump would be a catastrophic president.

In order to have a vacancy, in order to have an opportunity to run another candidate, President Biden has to decide not to run. And that, ultimately, is his decision to make. And it’s going to be an excruciating and very hard decision.

And to me, part of the reason that anointing Kamala Harris, who is his vice president, is an easier thing to do than simply throwing it open to a brokered convention is that this is a natural order of things. You choose a vice president because you might not live through your entire term. That’s true of any president. I think it would be easier and less damaging for the party for President Biden to simply say, “You know what? I think my time is up. It’s time for me to pass the baton to the person you, the voters, voted into office as part of my administration to carry us forward.”

Nicholas Kristof: ‘Gretchen Whitmer Is the Best Biden Alternative’

I’m Nicholas Kristof, and I’m here with a case for Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan.

I’m rooting for Whitmer because the job of the nominee — and especially at a time when the stakes are so high, when Donald Trump is the opposition — the job of the nominee is to win. I do think that Governor Whitmer is particularly well placed to get votes in the handful of states that are in play.

For starters, Michigan is an absolute must-win state for the Democrats, and Whitmer has won it handily in both her races for governor. That suggests that she will also do well in nearby states like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and I think her pragmatism will also play well with centrists in states like Arizona and Georgia.

I think a Michigan governor is well positioned to ride the anti-incumbent, anti-elitist mood that we see among voters in the U.S. and just to generate excitement as a fresh face on the national scene, somebody from a new generation. And boy, I would just relish seeing how a dynamic younger candidate can force Trump on his heels and make him defend himself as the old guy with dubious mental acuity left in the race.

I’ve been following Whitmer ever since she was a state senator, and in 2013 she gave just an extraordinary speech for abortion rights that put her on the national map.

Audio clip of Gretchen Whitmer: I rise for my “no” vote explanation, as the Republican male majority continues to ignorantly and unnecessarily weigh in on important women’s health issues that they know nothing about​.

Toward the end of that speech, she put down her notes and disclosed something that she had hidden from most people that was intensely personal.

Clip of Whitmer: Over 20 years ago, I was a victim of rape. And thank God, it didn’t result in a pregnancy, because I can’t imagine going through what I went through and then having to consider what to do about an unwanted pregnancy from an attacker.

She was emotional, raw, powerful and persuasive. And that speech marked her as a politician to watch.

Look, there are lots of uncertainties ahead. I have no idea what Whitmer’s foreign policy would be. But I do know that she’s a good speaker, that she has shown she can win over centrist voters and that she was only 1 year old when Biden was elected to the Senate. So in my view, Gretchen Whitmer is the best Biden alternative. Keep an eye on her.

Ross Douthat: Joe Manchin Would Be ‘the Most Moderate Candidate’

I’m Ross Douthat, and I’m a columnist for The New York Times. I’m here to make the case that the Democrats should nominate the senator from West Virginia Joe Manchin.

Much of the Democratic Party and many of my friends in the media are convinced that this election has almost existential stakes for the United States of America. And if that is the case, there is a reasonable argument for the Democratic Party to nominate someone who is as close to the center of American politics as you can get, with a long record of voting for Democratic causes. So, Manchin 2024.

I’ve thought Joe Manchin should run for president for a while. In 2023, I made the case that he should run as an independent. I thought, as a moderate Democrat, Manchin was well positioned to run basically, I argued, a kind of test-the-waters campaign.

But the reason to think of him as a plausible third-party candidate is also the reason to think of him as a plausible nominee for the Democrats — if their absolute goal is to defeat Donald Trump, no matter what.

Manchin is a guy who successfully managed to get elected to the Senate from West Virginia over the course of multiple election cycles where West Virginia was being transformed from a reliably Democratic state into a reliably Republican one. And his strategy always seemed to be: Pull a given piece of Democratic legislation more toward the middle (or toward the middle as he understood it), but be willing to vote for it when push came to shove.

He was more socially conservative in various ways on issues ranging from abortion to immigration. He tended to be more skeptical of large spending bills of all kinds, climate change legislation in particular. He did a lot of things, especially in the Biden era, that made more ideological Democrats incredibly frustrated with him. At the same time, he remained a pretty reliable vote for Democratic causes and programs and judicial nominations and everything else.

In imagining him as a Democratic nominee, you’re picking someone who in a different kind of era would have been the leader of probably a pretty big centrist faction in the Democratic Party. And so nominating him wouldn’t require the Democratic Party to radically shift its positions on almost any issue. It would be a unique signal to the country that the Democrats were willing to make a major ideological compromise, which is the kind of signal that, if you are determined to win the election at all costs, you want to be sending.

I think Manchin’s biggest challenge in the incredibly unlikely event that he was the Democratic nominee is that because he is a moderate who is despised by key activist groups in the Democratic coalition, most Democrats are just not going to turn out for someone who spent the Biden years trying to make Joe Biden’s agenda more moderate and sometimes contributing to derailing it.

That’s always the problem with trying to nominate the most moderate candidate: You risk alienating your own base. But I think in this scenario, given the lateness of the hour and Donald Trump as the presumptive Republican nominee, that what you would gain among swing voters would outweigh what you would lose in the party’s base.

Both political parties have nominated candidates for president who are broadly unacceptable to the middle 30 percent of Americans, and it would probably be useful for the country if one of the two parties tried to nominate someone who was much more acceptable to Americans in that middle ground.

Pamela Paul: Wes Moore Could ‘Energize the Electorate’

I’m Pamela Paul, an Opinion columnist for The New York Times, and I’m here to make the case for Wes Moore as the Democratic candidate for president.

Wes Moore is the first-term governor of the State of Maryland. So, relatively inexperienced in politics but with a broad range of experience before coming to politics. He has served in the military, including serving at war in Afghanistan. He’s worked in the private sector in investment banking. He has foreign policy experience and expertise, and he’s published five books, including books for young people.

As the former editor of The Book Review, I’ve been aware of Wes Moore for a long time as an author, and that’s how I often thought about him. I first met him out at Stanford University, where he was participating in a conference about revitalizing American institutions. He and Gov. Chris Sununu, Republican of New Hampshire, did a panel together in which they had a really lively, interesting conversation.

Audio clip of Chris Sununu: I’m absolutely honored to be here and to be with Wes who I consider a great friend. He’s a great governor.

And the thing that struck me most about their conversation is that they were friends, even though they are from very different sides of the political spectrum.

Chris Sununu, as the more experienced governor, has given advice to Wes Moore, and Wes Moore called him his best adviser as a governor.

Clip of Wes Moore: When I think about some of the governors who are the most helpful to me, as I made the transition, because I’d never run for office before I became governor. People can think about “It’s this governor, that governor, which political party.” The reality is, you’ve been one of the most helpful governors to me in this transition. And that’s a Republican governor.

And I thought that was remarkable because, as we all know, we live in a hyperpartisan time.

And something that really came out in their conversation was that, as governors, you need to get things done. You need to balance a budget. You cannot just not vote. You cannot just slide by. It’s not like the Senate. And one of the reasons I think that Governor Moore is one of the best-equipped people to assume the presidency is that as a governor, he has better experience than many people who have served in Washington for a long time.

I think his relative youth could shake up a campaign that no one is happy with between two geriatric candidates. He could energize the electorate. I think that he could win and govern well and he could really usher in a new era of leadership for Democrats. I mean, how have we gotten into a situation where we have an 81-year-old man who’s been in politics his entire life as being our candidate when it’s clear that Americans are not happy with how things are going and with the current direction of this country?

The No. 1 thing people will say about Wes Moore is that he doesn’t have the experience necessary, that it’s not his time yet. But first of all, I feel very frustrated with the “it’s his time” or “it’s not his time” thinking because when Biden was running, everyone thought, “Oh, it’s his time. He deserves it.” When Bob Dole was running: “Oh, it’s his turn. He deserves it.” This is a way to lose a campaign.

This is not about making someone feel better. This is about what’s doing right for the country. And Wes Moore, though he may not have a lot of governmental experience, he certainly has a lot more experience than Donald Trump did coming on.

And in fact, I think his relative inexperience would work in his favor because people are looking for someone to bring a new perspective who is not afraid of change, who can draw from a wide range of experience outside Washington and who’s shown that he knows how to solve problems and lead.

David French: Josh Shapiro Would Be a Choice Americans Can Feel ‘Unambiguously Good About’

I’m David French. And I’m here to make the case that Josh Shapiro should replace Joe Biden on the top of the Democratic ticket.

Until 2016, I was a Republican. I’m still conservative. I’m a conservative in the Reagan conservative mold. So it is very unusual for me to be giving any kind of advice to the Democratic Party. However, I am of the belief that Donald Trump needs to lose in 2024 for the health of the country, for the health of our Constitution and for the health, honestly, of the Republican Party and the conservative movement. And so I want to see the best possible Democrat face Donald Trump in 2024.

Josh Shapiro is the first-term governor of Pennsylvania, a former attorney general of Pennsylvania and a former member of the State House of Pennsylvania.

I think there are multiple reasons Josh Shapiro would be a very good pick. And we can start with ideology, we can go to temperament, and then we can end with location, location, location.

So, ideology. Josh Shapiro is a more moderate or centrist Democrat. There are a number of initiatives, for example, in the State of Pennsylvania, that he has broken with his party on, at least to some degree, to move toward the center. For example, he has advocated for lowering corporate tax rates in Pennsylvania, the kinds of things that Republican voters would either appreciate or at least see that this person is not an ideological extremist, but somebody who’s willing to reach out across the aisle.

He’s somebody who ideologically is much closer to the exact kinds of voters who helped give Joe Biden the presidency in 2020, a lot of these suburban voters and college-educated women and others, many of whom voted Republican in the past. He seems to be much more in line with the bulk of the American people than somebody who’s more on the left side of the Democratic Party.

And then let’s talk about the really important aspect of temperament. This is a guy who really, by and large, has a pretty measured tone, an ideal way of confronting someone like Donald Trump, who really needs to be meticulously rebutted in all of his falsehoods. Dismantling these wild statements that Donald Trump has made and doing so in a calm and measured way, I think, is exactly what the doctor ordered for the public square. It would, in many ways, be a restoration of the way we think about the presidency: that we’re not just electing a vehicle for an agenda but a human being who we could actually have a degree of trust in.

And then finally, he has the advantage of location, location, location — the three most important things in real estate. He’s a popular governor in a key swing state. This is perhaps the key swing state in the 2024 election. And this is something that’s really important not just for the sake of Pennsylvania but other swing states. I think there’s some real possibility there that he’s actually a good cultural fit for some of these swing states.

And there’s one other thing I didn’t mention: He’s relatively young. He was born in 1973. He’s a Gen X-er. And this contrast between a Gen X candidate who’s reasonable, who’s sober, who’s sharp as a tack, against a 78-year-old man who physically is able to sort of cover up his decline but cognitively is capable of the exact kinds of word salads that we saw come out of Joe Biden’s mouth in the debate — the contrast, I believe, would be very real and very obvious and exactly the kind of contrast that the American people are looking for.

And so these are all things that I think speak strongly in his favor, but I’m not going to pretend that it’s just a no-brainer of a decision. There are also some downsides that come with Josh Shapiro. Nothing major or glaring, but there’s two right away that you can think of. One, he’s a first-term governor. He’s not had a complete term as a governor, so there would be some questions about experience. It also has to be acknowledged that nobody knows who he is. If you’ve tuned into this and you knew who Josh Shapiro was before you tuned in, you’re either a Pennsylvanian or a political nerd. And nothing against political nerds — I’m one of you — but it’s just part of the challenge that you have when you’re trying to introduce yourself to the American people.

But on balance, when you’re talking about the identity of a candidate: Is he a man for the moment? It’s not simply the case that you can say people want anyone not named Donald Trump. That’s not where the American people are. They’re wanting a choice that they can feel unambiguously good about. And the debate performance, I think, robbed Biden of that message now and for the rest of the campaign.

Here is a different candidate people can be voting for, as opposed to purely voting against Donald Trump.

Charles M. Blow: ‘Joe Biden Should Not Be Forced Off the Ticket’

I’m Charles Blow, an Opinion columnist at The New York Times. And while a lot of my colleagues are making the case for replacements for Joe Biden, I’m making the case that Joe Biden should not be forced off the ticket.

I assume that most people who want to replace Joe Biden want the exact same thing that I want, which is to prevent Donald Trump from being re-elected as president of the United States.

If that is the goal, then you have to go with the person who has the best chance of defeating him. And I think that for right now, that person remains Joe Biden.

There is no evidence that any of the other candidates who have been proposed as possible replacements for Joe Biden would do better than Joe Biden. There is no F.D.R.-, Barack Obama-like candidate waiting in the wings whom everyone knows and who is going to galvanize the Democratic Party.

The people in Louisiana do not know the governor of Michigan. The people in North Carolina do not know the governor of California. And we are saying that somehow in a brokered convention at the end of the summer with only three months to go, you could put forth a virtually unknown person to the country and that somehow that would be better than sticking with a person whom we already know.

In addition to that, a brokered convention would mean that the voters would not have a say in who the candidate is. There would be no direct voting for the person the Democrats put forward. These would be delegates. Some of them are elected officials, and I guess you could say that elected officials are kind of secondhand representatives of the people. So people did vote for the elected officials, and if they vote for the candidate, maybe that makes you feel a little bit better.

But delegates are also party leaders. No one voted for these party leaders. These are just people who have participated and won favor and people like them. Those are the people who would pick the candidate? That is not democratic. That doesn’t feel like the business that the Democratic Party would want to be in, which is having the candidates produced not by the voice of the people but by the voice of the insiders.

This has become an election about people who are for democracy and those who are not for it. It has nothing to do with the individual people and the individual characters and their individual competency.

So I’m not trying to convince anyone that Biden is your best candidate, he’s a fantastic person, shooting on all cylinders and full of verve. I’m just saying that as it stands, he is likely your best option to prevent catastrophe. None of these candidates are people that I’m going to say, ‘Oh, I’m just jumping up and down because this person is so electric and magnetic.”

I’m simply saying, “Do you want to keep a country or not? Where’s your best chances of keeping the country that you know and you love and that will have a chance to fight again one day with different candidates who may be younger, may be more to your tastes?""","A black and white image of six individuals, presumably political figures, with their faces obscured, standing side by side.

c77923a73c,Forbes,What Is DevOps? Becoming A DevOps Engineer - Forbes,"DevOps (development and operations) is a popular set of practices, tools, philosophies and processes for streamlining and improving the software development lifecycle. DevOps engineers collaborate and communicate between development and operations teams and facilitate continuous improvement and technology automation in software development.

With strong demand for this skill set in the developer hiring market, learning DevOps can help you improve your career prospects. Popular DevOps career paths include software developer, security engineer and DevOps engineer.

But what is a DevOps engineer, and what do these professionals do? Responsibilities and job descriptions for this role vary, but DevOps engineers generally oversee and improve the software development lifecycle. They use coding, administrative, problem solving and interpersonal skills to connect development and operations teams and improve, speed up and automate parts of the software development process.

What Is DevOps?

DevOps is a strategic approach to planning, developing, deploying and administering software programs and applications.

Historically, software operations teams and development teams worked separately from each other. Starting around 2007, however, the DevOps model began to challenge this isolated approach to software development.

DevOps encourages software developers, IT operations, IT security and quality engineering professionals to collaborate throughout the software development lifecycle. This requires an organization-wide commitment to embrace a DevOps culture.

DevOps focuses on improving customer service by speeding up, automating and continually improving software planning, development, deployment and operations. Other DevOps goals include agility and adaptability, reliability and shorter recovery times following security breaches and failures.

Companies increasingly want professionals with DevOps skills. The 2022 State of Tech Hiring Report from CoderPad and CodinGame found that 25% of recruiters planned to hire DevOps engineers in the coming year, speaking to the high demand for this role.

How To Learn DevOps

DevOps professionals come from diverse tech backgrounds, and there isn’t one clear-cut path to launching a DevOps career. You can start learning DevOps by completing a relevant bootcamp or online course.

Complete a Coding Bootcamp

A coding bootcamp can help you quickly learn the programming skills needed for a DevOps career. Compared to traditional four-year college degrees, coding bootcamps take less time to complete and often require a smaller financial investment.

Coding bootcamps provide intensive hands-on training to help graduates build the skills for entry-level IT positions. A typical coding bootcamp covers computer science fundamentals, computer programming languages, web development and databases. Some bootcamps cover several coding languages; others focus on just one.

If you already have a good grasp on programming, you might consider a DevOps-focused coding bootcamp. DevOps bootcamps cover topics such as continuous delivery, configuration management, containerization and deployment automation. They provide hands-on training with popular DevOps tools like Kubernetes, Terraform and Ansible.

Take an Online Course

Online courses offer another excellent way to learn about DevOps and get a feel for the field. Usually offering a self-paced learning structure, online courses come with various levels of instructor engagement, career support, education and experience prerequisites and tuition prices.

What Is a DevOps Engineer?

A DevOps engineer leverages development, operations and administration skills and strategies to apply code and improve the overall software development process.

Because DevOps seeks to improve technology and culture, DevOps engineers need strong technical coding and interpersonal skills. Although DevOps skills are in demand, the DevOps engineering role is relatively new; responsibilities and job descriptions vary.

Typical DevOps work environments include the computer systems design industry, software publishing companies, and finance and insurance. DevOps engineers often work with software developers, system administrators and site reliability engineers.

DevOps engineers need communication skills. They must understand the goals of their organization’s development and operations teams. Interpersonal skills can help DevOps professionals facilitate better collaboration between teams, cutting down the time needed to develop and deploy a software product.

Typical responsibilities for a DevOps engineer may include building and deploying code, automating tasks, updating software and system administration. DevOps engineers also work on security issues, plan new code, test software reliability and troubleshoot problems.

How To Become a DevOps Engineer

DevOps engineers need expertise in coding and operating systems, and many hold bachelor’s degrees in computer science-related fields. Many employers prefer or require a DevOps certification and relevant professional experience. Learn more about what it takes to become a DevOps engineer below.

Learn Coding Languages

Coding, which involves using computer programming languages to create websites and applications, is a foundational skill for DevOps engineers. Popular coding languages for this role include Python, Java, JavaScript and HTML. DevOps engineers should also understand data structures and algorithms, web development, databases, and cloud computing.

Become Familiar With Operating Systems

DevOps engineers need a strong grasp on operating systems, which are the main computer programs enabling all other software and hardware programs to run.

Get exposure to several common operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, Google Android, Apple macOS and iOS, and Linux. Familiarize yourself with operating system issues like network management, security management and file management.

Get a Bachelor’s Degree

DevOps engineers typically need a bachelor’s degree in computer science, software development, information technology, computer programming or software engineering. Programs vary in focus and curricula but should include classes in computer programming languages, foundations of computer science and operating systems.

That said, many employers hire applicants without academic backgrounds in computer science for DevOps positions. While a degree helps your chances, you can still find work if you can demonstrate relevant skills learned through self-study or a bootcamp program.

Earn Professional Certification

Though not universally required by the industry, professional certification can help you launch a DevOps career. A DevOps certification can help you show potential employers you have the technical skills and knowledge to succeed.

The tech industry highly values certifications, with many employers preferring or requiring applicants to hold relevant professional credentials. You can use a professional certification to help yourself stand out from other DevOps job applicants or to ask for a higher starting salary or a raise.

00a54141b1,Financial Times,Can the Rolls-Royce rally continue? - Financial Times,"Four years ago, Rolls-Royce was forced to ask shareholders for money and cut 9,000 staff to weather the downturn brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Last week, Britain’s flagship engineer reported a 74 per cent jump in half-year profits, a resumption of dividend payments and a gift of 150 shares per employee, marking one of the most remarkable and rapid turnarounds in recent UK corporate history.

The sharp shift in its fortunes coincided with the arrival of Tufan Erginbilgiç, who took the controls in January 2023. Shares in Rolls-Royce have more than quadrupled over that time, outperforming most major indices.

The company’s turbocharged performance means that it is already more than halfway towards annual profit and cash flow targets set by Erginbilgiç for 2027; Rolls-Royce now expects to deliver more than 75 per cent of its target of up to £2.8bn in annual operating profit and more than 65 per cent of its goal of up to £3.1bn free cash flow by the end of this year.

Although his predecessor, Warren East, successfully steered the company through the depths of the pandemic, Erginbilgiç, who described Rolls-Royce as a “burning platform” when he joined, has moved quickly to shake up senior management, reduce duplication and cull middle managers.

The rapid transformation of the 118-year-old manufacturer, whose recent history has been marked by sharp swings in fortune, has raised questions over how long Rolls-Royce’s current winning streak can last. Can the former oil industry executive deliver on his promise to turn the company into a “high-performing, competitive and resilient business”?

Erginbilgiç admitted that the rate of recovery would not be linear but argued that the group’s midterm targets should be seen as a “milestone, not a destination”.

“There is a very exciting, more profitable growth story beyond the midterm,” he said.

He dismissed suggestions that part of the recent success was down to the return of international air traffic following the pandemic, which all but halted travel. Rolls-Royce’s biggest division builds engines for the world’s largest passenger aircraft but makes most of its money from servicing and maintaining these while they are in service.

“This is not a flying hours story, that question should disappear,” he said. The company, he argued, was instigating real change, reducing costs and expanding the “cash potential and quality of the civil business”.

Rolls-Royce has renegotiated lossmaking contracts with customers to lift profitability and will invest more than £1bn over the coming years to improve the durability and performance of its Trent family of engines which power long-haul passenger planes such as Boeing’s 787 and the Airbus A350.

Analysts said the performance of the civil business in the half-year stood out. Engine flying hours, a key metric given the company makes most of its money when its engines are in operation, were back to pre-pandemic levels while margins in the business had risen 18 per cent over the six months.

The new management had “squeezed more out of the upside than people expected . . .[they] got more out of it than the old Rolls-Royce would have done”, said Nick Cunningham, analyst at Agency Partners.

The “structural change”, he added, “is partly about the company being more tightly run with a clear set of guidelines as to what they are trying to achieve”.

Company insiders talk about the “pace and intensity” Erginbilgiç has brought to the business, much of it evident in the rigorous, regular reviews he holds with senior managers, where clear targets are set.

He had instilled a “sense of commercial-mindedness . . . not only through civil but throughout the entire organisation and [has] kept the costs out that the company had taken out during Covid”, said Harsh Jhaveri, investment analyst at Orbis Investments, which bought into Rolls-Royce in 2016 and owns 0.5 per cent of the company.

While much of the focus has been on the improvement in Rolls-Royce’s commercial aircraft division, its other businesses have also rebounded. The underperforming power systems unit — which makes diesel and gas engines for ships, as well as power generators for data centres — has recovered.

Last week’s half-year results showed that the division’s underlying operating profit grew by 56 per cent to £189mn. Its underlying operating margin rose to 10.3 per cent, with expectations of further improvement in the second half.

In the defence unit, Rolls-Royce has notched up some notable contract awards and should benefit from higher government spending, including on the Aukus submarine programme with Australia and the US.

In the medium term, the big challenge strategically will be how the company can re-enter the lucrative short-haul narrow-body aircraft market. Rolls-Royce left that sector over a decade ago when it pulled out of a joint venture with Pratt & Whitney of the US. The British company recently started work on a demonstrator of its Ultrafan engine, which would be specifically designed to power a next-generation narrow-body jet.

Erginbilgiç said he was talking to Airbus and Boeing about the engine. Rather than developing and building it alone, he would prefer a partnership with another company, he added.

Notwithstanding the company’s strong performance, there are some clouds on the horizon. Industry-wide supply chain challenges could persist for another two years. Rolls-Royce’s cash flow guidance for the year includes an impact of as much as £200mn from supply chain issues.

There are also some early signs of pressure on airline yields, a measure of average ticket prices that takes into account passenger numbers and distance flown. Most aerospace executives insist it is too early to talk about a fall in traffic growth and hence demand, but the biggest test of whether Erginbilgiç’s transformation has paid off will probably come with the industry’s next downturn — and whether he has made Rolls-Royce more resilient.

Most analysts reiterated their “buy” ratings on the company last week, arguing there was more to come despite the shares trading at a multiple of around 25 times next year’s earnings.

Philip Buller, analyst at Berenberg, who downgraded the stock to “sell” at the start of the year, admitted his call came to too early given the 50 per cent plus run-up in the shares since January.

He credited Erginbilgiç and his team for “over-delivering” on cost controls but argued that investors should look beyond 2027. “What happens to cash post-2027 . . . and is there anything else in the interim that could spoil the party, such as air traffic softening?”

The shares, he said, were now priced for “this very nice moment in all end markets to be a permanent feature”. However, “history tells us this is not normally the case”, he cautioned.",An older man in a suit stands in front of a Rolls-Royce logo on an orange background.,<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA2F6DDB0>,2024-08-04 04:00:42.627000+00:00,https://www.ft.com,https://www.ft.com/content/9ee9ba07-382a-4897-a7d7-7ec4207b256d,['Business and Finance'],[0.95],Unlikely,Likely,sample_review/images/00a54141b1.png
ffd854f60f,BBC.com,"Who is Tim Walz, Kamala Harris' pick for vice president? - BBC.com","Tim Walz: The ex-football coach and teacher who became Harris's VP pick

With one viral line on cable TV - ""these guys are just weird"" - Tim Walz vaulted into contention for the job of Kamala Harris's running mate.

The 60-year-old brings with him a folksy, plain-spoken and sharp-tongued approach to taking on the Republican opposition.

He also comes with a compelling resume - a public school teacher, football coach and National Guardsman before he entered politics.

His political experience, representing a Republican-leaning district in Congress and then later passing left-wing policies as Minnesota's governor, could have broad appeal at a time when American politics is so polarised.

Teacher, football coach, Congressman

A native of rural Nebraska, Mr Walz farmed and hunted in his summertimes and enlisted in the Army National Guard at 17. He would serve in the volunteer force for 24 years.

His father, a public school administrator, encouraged him to join the military before he died from lung cancer when Mr Walz was 19.

The Minnesota governor has spoken of how Social Security survivor benefits sustained his mother, and how the GI Bill paid for his college education.

Armed with teaching degrees, Mr Walz took on a one-year teaching post in China around the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre.

He later honeymooned in the country with wife Gwen Whipple and also organised summer educational trips to China for US students.

After returning home to Nebraska, Mr Walz became a teacher and American football coach until his wife - another teacher at the school - drew him back to her native Minnesota.

'He offers so much': Democrat voters on Walz

As a coach at Mankato West High School, Mr Walz helped build up an American football programme that led the school to its first state championship.

Former members of the team appeared on stage when Mr Walz addressed the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. He leant heavily into American football metaphors during his address to party faithful, saying: ""We're driving down the field, and boy, do we have the right team.""

During his teaching career, Mr Walz also earned plaudits for agreeing to be the faculty adviser for the school's gay-straight alliance at a time when homosexuality was largely frowned upon.

He first ran for office in a very agricultural district that spans across southern Minnesota, which is fairly rural and Republican-leaning.

But Mr Walz campaigned as a moderate who cared about public service and veterans' advocacy, leading to an election upset.

Views and beliefs

Over his 12 years in Congress, it was hard to label his ideology.

He voted in favour of the Affordable Care Act, co-sponsored pro-labour measures, including a bill to raise the minimum wage, and backed an unsuccessful cap-and-trade effort for reducing carbon emissions.

But he also found common cause with Republicans.

He voted to continue funding the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, supported tighter vetting of refugees entering the US, and tried to block the Obama-era bailout of banks and car companies after the 2008 financial crash.

Trump's life story, from real estate to politics

Once endorsed by the pro-gun National Rifle Association (NRA), which donated to his campaign, he spoke out in favour of an assault weapons ban after the Parkland school shooting and lost their backing.

Mr Walz won the 2018 Minnesota governor's race by more than 11 points but his first term was overshadowed by the Covid pandemic and the killing of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis.

Republicans heavily criticised Mr Walz for being slow to deploy the National Guard even as some protests grew violent.

But the governor won re-election and his second term has overseen a busy period with Democrats controlling the state legislature by a single seat.

Democrats have enshrined abortion rights, enacted paid family and sick leave, strengthened gun laws, funded universal free school meals and invested in affordable housing.

The frenetic activity caught the eye of former President Barack Obama who wrote: “If you need a reminder that elections have consequences, check out what’s happening in Minnesota.”

'These are weird people'

Largely unknown on the national scene, Mr Walz has quickly gathered buzz in recent weeks for his acerbic descriptions of Republicans.

""These are weird people on the other side,"" he recently told MSNBC, a label that has been widely repeated. ""They want to ban books. They want to be in your [doctor's] exam room.""

But Republicans have been quick to characterise what he has done in Minnesota as too radical for ordinary Americans.

Tom Emmer, the third-highest ranking Republican in the US House of Representatives, accused Mr Walz of trying ""to turn Minnesota into Kamala Harris’ home state of California"".

But allies, including labour leaders, believe Mr Walz can broaden Ms Harris's appeal to rural and working class voters.

Angie Craig, a House Democrat locked in a competitive race for re-election, praised Mr Walz as ""a battle-tested leader"".

As ""a proven winner who has never lost an election across many tough races"", she told the BBC she believed he would be the best possible addition to the Harris ticket.

a682d900d5,The Guardian,Inquiry to begin into DWP’s treatment of ill and disabled people on benefits - The Guardian,"The treatment of chronically ill and disabled people by welfare officials, including benefits decisions subsequently linked to the deaths of vulnerable claimants, is to be formally investigated by Britain’s human rights watchdog.

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said it would examine whether ministers at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had acted unlawfully by failing to protect claimants with learning disabilities or severe mental illness.

Labour MP Debbie Abrahams, a long-term campaigner on the issue, said: “I welcome the EHRC’s decision to use the full force of its powers and officially launch an investigation into the DWP and the tragic deaths of vulnerable welfare claimants.”

The focus of the inquiry will be on health checks that assess individuals’ eligibility for disability benefits such as personal independence payment and “fit for work” tests that qualify claimants for the disability elements of universal credit.

Kishwer Falkner, the chair of the EHRC, said: “We are extremely worried about the treatment of some disabled benefits claimants by the DWP. We suspect the department may have broken equality law. We have decided we need to take the strongest possible action and that’s why we’ve launched this investigation.”

Campaigners have for years argued that benefit assessments are poorly designed, punitive and degrading. As a result vulnerable claimants are at risk of unfairly losing benefit entitlements, causing hardship and in extreme cases with lethal consequences.

Flawed benefit assessments have been at the heart of a number of high-profile cases, including Errol Graham, a grandfather with mental illness who starved to death alone in his flat months after having his benefits stopped.

Last year the mother of Jodey Whiting, a seriously mentally ill mother who killed herself a fortnight after her benefits were wrongly cut off in 2017, won an appeal for a fresh inquest into her daughter’s death.

Government auditors identified at least 69 cases between 2014 and 2020 where suicides had been linked to problems with benefit claims. The DWP subsequently promised to overhaul its safeguarding guidance to provide support to vulnerable claimants rather than simply withdrawing their benefits.

The investigation marks a significant escalation in the EHRC’s interest in the DWP’s treatment of benefit claimants, which has been quietly under way since early 2021 after Abrahams and other MPs asked the watchdog to examine the “deaths of vulnerable claimants by suicide and other causes”.

It was initially expected that the watchdog and the DWP would sign a voluntary agreement to jointly address concerns over the fairness of benefits assessment processes but the EHRC appears to have lost patience with ministers and has opted to mount a full-scale inquiry.

Past and current welfare ministers as well as senior DWP officials may be called to give evidence to the investigation, which is also inviting submissions from whistleblowers who worked for the department or private contractors who carried out benefit assessments, such as Maximus, Atos and Capita.

The investigation will mainly cover the period from January 2021 to the present. During this period there have been three secretaries of state for work and pensions: the incumbent Mel Stride, Thérèse Coffey and Chloe Smith, who held the post for a few weeks in autumn 2022.

Abrahams said: “I am pleased that the EHRC have now said enough is enough and will be undertaking a formal investigation. I hope this can be done as a matter of urgency.”

James Taylor, executive director of strategy, impact and social change at disability charity Scope, said: “We know just how many disabled people have a poor and degrading experience when trying to make use of our benefit system. Our welfare system should be a safety net, built on kindness and trust, where disabled people can access support. Instead, many disabled people have to fight for even basic support.”

Megan Pennell, head of public affairs at the charity Mind, welcomed the investigation: “This is extremely concerning but sadly it echoes what we hear from people with mental health problems on a daily basis – that the DWP is failing to make assessments fair for people with mental health problems.”

Anna Morell of Disability Rights UK said: “There has been a systemic failure of disabled people, and a culture of distrust, disbelief and punishment exists when it comes to the DWP providing benefits and support for disabled people.”

A DWP spokesperson said: “The government is committed to improving the lives of disabled people and our recent disability action plan sets out 32 actions we are taking to make the UK the most accessible country in the world for disabled people to live, work and thrive.

“The DWP is committed to providing a compassionate service to all our customers. Benefits assessments are carried out by qualified health professionals with reasonable adjustments available to protect vulnerable claimants.

2c02425ec6,The Guardian,"Labour government would halt Rwanda deportations from day one, Starmer says - The Guardian","Labour will not allow any deportation flights to take off for Rwanda from the moment it wins an election, Keir Starmer has said.

After a speech in which he announced his plans to tackle illegal immigration, Starmer committed to scrapping the Rwanda scheme “absolutely, flights and all”.

Starmer told Sky News: “There will be no flights scheduled or taking off after the general election if Labour wins that general election.”

The Labour leader made the commitments in Deal, part of the constituency represented by Natalie Elphicke who defected to Labour this week from the Conservatives.

Elphicke introduced Starmer before his speech and said that under his leadership Labour “occupies the centre ground and looks to the future”. She added: “Nowhere is Rishi Sunak’s lack of delivery clearer than on the issue of small boats.”

James Cleverly, the home secretary, claimed it was “comic” for Labour to scrap the scheme when it was “demonstrably” working – despite no flights departing for Rwanda yet.

Starmer described it as a “gimmick” and a “waste of money”, and said he would replace it with a border security command.

He added: “Of course that means we won’t operate the scheme at all … I’m not going to flog a dead horse or waste my time with gimmicks.”

Starmer declined to promise to “stop the boats”, a catchphrase used by Sunak, or to set a target on reducing the number of people crossing the Channel, saying instead that it needed to be reduced “materially”.

He said he would “like it to come down completely” but would not put a “false number” on his plans.

Cleverly told LBC that the government’s plans were “still in early stages”. He acknowledged the initial numbers would be low but it was an “uncapped scheme”.

“To take that off the table just as we are starting to see an positive effect is a ridiculous notion by the Labour party,” Cleverly said.

Pressed on the more than 3,500 people identified for the first flights to Rwanda with whom contact has been lost by the authorities, Cleverly said some people “abscond, we find, them, we remove them … When people fail to report, the immigration enforcement do their work.”

On Thursday, 211 people were detected crossing the Channel, according to provisional figures from the Home Office. The provisional total of arrivals by small boats in 2024 is 9,037. This is 35% higher than the total at this time last year, which was 6,691.

Asked whether safe and legal routes for asylum seekers would play a role in stopping Channel crossings, Starmer said: “The most effective way to stop the crossings is to break gangs”. He said there were already safe and legal routes for asylum seekers from Afghanistan and Hong Kong.

In his speech, Starmer announced a plan to divert £75m to fund hundreds of specialist officer roles to tackle people-smuggling with new counter-terrorism powers.

He said the policy, which will appear in the Labour manifesto, would bring “an end to the fragmentation between policing, the border force and our intelligence agencies” and create a new “elite force” for border protection.

Starmer said he believed Sunak’s government would succeed in sending flights to Rwanda before the election, but that this would only result in a few hundred asylum seekers being deported when thousands had crossed the Channel already this year.

“£600m for a few hundred removed – that is gesture politics,” he said. “We will end this farce. We will restore serious government to our borders, tackle this problem at source, and replace the Rwanda policy – permanently.”

“Stopping the gangs getting people in boats is the most effective deterrent because you can’t actually make the crossing to get here,” he said. He blamed the government’s “botched Brexit deal” for hampering cooperation with European agencies on border security and illegal migration.

Starmer also promised to rebuild the “broken asylum system” and said Britain was seen as a “soft touch”. He said the current system, which removes less than 1% of arrivals from small boat crossings a year, was “like Hotel California, there is no prospect of ever leaving and no prospect of a decision for or against”.

He argued that rebuilding that system had “become a test of political strength” and “a trial of leadership”, which Sunak had failed.

Speaking more broadly, the Labour leader pledged to “turn the page on Westminster’s talk tough, do nothing culture”.

He said there was a problem with “our politics as a whole, a culture that is part of the water in Westminster that rewards the grand gesture, the big talk, while disregarding the detailed practical action that, over time, moves a nation forward, step by step”.

He said that since taking over the Labour leadership from Jeremy Corbyn he had “dragged my party away from the allure of gesture politics and I will do exactly the same to Westminster”.","A man in a dark suit and red tie stands at a podium with a microphone, gesturing with his right hand.

24efcbc768,CNN,Biden says antisemitism has no place in America in somber speech connecting the Holocaust to Hamas’ attack on Israel - CNN,"President Joe Biden on Tuesday issued a call to fight a “ferocious surge” of antisemitism, saying such hate has no place in America as he connected the horrors of the Holocaust to Hamas’ attack on Israel.

Biden’s speech was a somber – yet impassioned – moment of reflection amid a tense and pivotal time in his reelection push. The October 7 attack and the subsequent war in Gaza has proved to be one of the most politically fraught periods of Biden’s presidency, one that is particularly personal for the longtime supporter of Israel who views antisemitism as antithetical to American values.

“We must give hate no safe harbor against anyone,” Biden said.

But Biden’s staunch support for Israel’s war against Hamas, which has now led to the deaths of more than 34,000 Palestinians, has caused deep fractures in the coalition that sent him to the White House in 2020. Protests on college campuses over Israel’s campaign and the Biden administration’s support for it have spread across the nation, highlighting potential political problems that the president is facing with the younger voters he needs to win a second term.

On Tuesday, during his keynote address at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum’s annual Days of Remembrance ceremony at the US Capitol, Biden sought to draw direct links between the horrors experienced by Jews under the Nazi regime to what happened in Israel last year and rising antisemitism after Hamas’ attack.

“This ancient hatred of Jews didn’t begin with the Holocaust – it didn’t end with the Holocaust, either, or even after our victory in World War II. This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world and requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness,” Biden said.

He continued, “Now, here we are – not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later – and people are already forgetting. They’re already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror. … I have not forgotten, nor have you, and we will not forget.”

Biden pointed to a “ferocious surge” of antisemitism in the US in the aftermath of October 7, from propaganda on social media to Jewish students being harassed or attacked on campus.

“Too many people denying, downplaying, rationalizing and ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and October 7 – including Hamas’ appalling use of sexual violence to torture and terrorize. It’s absolutely despicable – and it must stop,” he said, raising his voice.

The president spoke out forcefully against intensifying antisemitism and Islamophobia in the days after Hamas’ attacks on Israel, saying in an October 19 Oval Office address that Americans “can’t stand by and stand silent.” Yet in the seven months since the war began, Islamophobic and antisemitic incidents have significantly increased.

The most recent data from the Anti-Defamation League, which has tracked antisemitic incidents in the US since 1979, found a 140% increase in incidents from 2022 to 2023, with a “dramatic” increase taking place after October 7. And an ADL report on antisemitic attitudes in America in 2024 found that younger Americans are “more likely to endorse anti-Jewish tropes.”

Biden offered a direct message to American Jews Tuesday.

“I see your fear, your hurt, and your pain. Let me reassure you as your president: You are not alone. You belong. You always have and you always will,” he said.

He recounted the story of Tom Lantos, who escaped a Nazi labor camp during the Holocaust with the help of Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who used his diplomatic cover to hide and rescue about 100,000 Jews. Lantos became a top adviser to Biden, then a first-term senator, and later became the only Holocaust survivor elected to Congress.

The president quoted Lantos, who warned, “The veneer of civilization is paper-thin. We are its guardians, and we can never rest.”

“My fellow Americans: We must be the guardians,” Biden added.

A sensitive spot for the president

While the president has been steadfast in his condemnations of antisemitism, the war in Gaza has made for a politically perilous topic for Biden and his White House as he tries to also show empathy with the conditions Palestinians now face in Gaza.

The president has faced protests at nearly every public event outside of the White House in recent months for his support of Israel’s war against Hamas, and his handling of the war has been under intense scrutiny since the days after the October 7 attacks.

The president and his administration now face another potential tipping point in the war. The speech came as Israel’s military has issued a call for residents of the eastern part of the Gazan city of Rafah to “evacuate immediately,” raising questions about whether Israel’s long-threatened assault on the city will soon be carried out – a move that the Biden administration has strongly cautioned against.

During nearly seven months of war, more than 1 million Palestinians have fled to Rafah, where Hamas is believed to have regrouped after Israel’s destruction of much of northern Gaza. Biden and his top lieutenants have repeatedly and emphatically made clear to their Israeli counterparts that they want to see a clear plan to protect civilians before any troops enter the area. While National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters Biden “again made this clear” in a Monday call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, it’s not clear such a plan has been presented to the US.

Biden on Tuesday reiterated his “ironclad” commitment to Israel’s right to exist as an independent Jewish state – “even when we disagree.”

Hamas announced Monday that it had agreed to a ceasefire proposal brokered by the Qatari and Egyptian governments, though the proposal appeared to have significant deviations from a proposal that had been formed with Israeli input. The Israeli government was reviewing the Hamas offer on Monday but continued operations in Rafah.

The speech also came as the administration is ramping up its response to pro-Palestinian protests over the war that have spread across the nation’s colleges and universities, with images of tension and some violence. More than 2,000 people have been arrested on college and university campuses since April 18.

On Tuesday, Biden reaffirmed the right to free speech, but roundly condemned antisemitism, hate speech and threats of violence “against Jews or anyone else.”

A shift in tone

Biden’s speech on the topic last week appeared to mark a shift in the administration’s response to the protests. A day later, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona sent a letter to college and university presidents condemning “abhorrent” incidents of antisemitism on campus and highlighting available resources – a move aimed at further bolstering the administration’s public-facing response to the protests.

He cited specific reports from Jewish students of being physically assaulted or harassed while walking on campus, antisemitic statements, including that Jewish students should “go back to Poland,” verbal abuse and swastikas found on dorm room doors.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, speaking earlier at the same event as Biden on Tuesday, compared the growing unrest at college campuses to German “elite centers of learning” in the 1930s and 40s “where anti-Jewish courses were introduced” and saying “today we are witnessing American universities quickly becoming hostile places for Jewish students and faculty.”

“The very campuses which were once the envy of the International Academy have succumbed to an antisemitic virus. Students who were known for producing academic papers are now known for stabbing their Jewish peers in the eyes with Palestinian flags. Faculty who once produced cutting-edge research are now linking arms with pro-Hamas protesters and calling for global intifada,” Johnson said.

On Monday, a day ahead of Biden’s speech, second gentleman Doug Emhoff hosted a number of Jewish students at the White House for a roundtable. Emhoff, who is the first Jewish spouse of a president or vice president and has been a key advocate on the issue, has made addressing antisemitism a cornerstone of his portfolio and has reached out to Jewish campus leaders.

Tuesday’s speech came alongside a series of new actions the Biden administration is taking to build on its national strategy to counter antisemitism, the White House announced in a fact sheet.

The Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights is sending a letter to every school district and college in the country with concrete examples of antisemitic discrimination that could be investigated under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. There are currently 141 open investigations with colleges and universities under Title VI, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.

The Department of Homeland Security is working to “build an online campus safety resource guide” to provide “financial, educational, and technical assistance” for campuses. DHS is also developing and sharing “best practices for community-based targeted violence and terrorism prevention,” the fact sheet said.

And the State Department’s Office of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism “will convene technology firms to identify best practices to address Antisemitic content online,” the fact sheet said.

Biden’s speech came one day after Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day. To mark the day, Biden’s campaign issued a lengthy list of former President Donald Trump’s antisemitic comments and behavior, including reports that Trump has allegedly said that Adolf Hitler “did some good things.” The speech was also not written to focus on drawing a political contrast with Trump, as so many of Biden’s speeches are these days, the senior administration official said.

Still, Biden’s steadfast support for Israel’s military offensive in Gaza has eroded some of his support among the young voters he needs months before the general election. A poll by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University’s Kennedy School found that only 18% of young voters approve of Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war.

‘An important moment’

Biden’s remarks linking the Holocaust and the October 7 attack were largely praised by pro-Israel groups.

Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of J Street – a liberal pro-Israel advocacy group – said in a statement he is grateful to Biden “for standing unequivocally against the sharp rise in antisemitism while also defending our First Amendment rights to speech and nonviolent protest.”

Adam Lehman, the president and CEO of Hillel International, a Jewish campus group, said in a statement Biden’s remarks “come at an important moment, as anti-Israel and anti-Jewish groups continue to pursue hateful, divisive and destructive actions that violate the civil rights of Jewish students and undermine campus safety for all students.”

However, leaders of two of the largest US Jewish groups that have been critical of Israel’s actions in its war with Hamas said Biden had missed the mark in his description of college protests.

Stefanie Fox, executive director of Jewish Voice for Peace, said Biden’s characterization of campus protests was “entirely inaccurate” and “a really intentional misrepresentation.” She said that “peaceful multiracial, multifaith student protesters are simply calling out the very clear complicity of their universities in the Israeli attack on Palestinians.”

Eva Borgwardt, a national spokesperson for IfNotNow, said Biden’s speech “was a misclassification of what’s happening on college campuses.”

“To respond to a few isolated incidents in what has been overwhelmingly nonviolent student protest with the use of police and state force that targets particularly Palestinian, black and brown students, Jewish students among them, is a completely irresponsible and dangerous approach to protest and does not at all advance any kind of Jewish safety,” Borgwardt said.

d62c1d0781,ABC News,Trump endorses GOP Rep. Bob Good's primary challenger -- a blow to the House Freedom Caucus chair - ABC News,"Rep. Bob Good is learning that lack of complete loyalty has consequences in Donald Trump's political world.

The former president on Tuesday endorsed the Virginia Republican's primary challenger, state legislator John McGuire, creating an uphill battle for the House Freedom Caucus chair who hopes to keep his seat.

""Bob Good is BAD FOR VIRGINIA, AND BAD FOR THE USA. He turned his back on our incredible movement, and was constantly attacking and fighting me until recently, when he gave a warm and 'loving' Endorsement - But really, it was too late,"" Trump posted on his social media platform.

During the 2024 GOP presidential primaries, Good endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, saying then that he wanted to back a candidate who had the ability to serve eight full years in the White House.

When DeSantis dropped out in Jan. 21, Good, on the same day, immediately endorsed Trump for president, calling him ""the greatest president of my lifetime"" as he worked to get back in the good graces of the former president who is known for holding grudges.

Before Trump made his official endorsement on Tuesday, Good was touting Trump's endorsement of him in 2022 on his campaign website. The website was then updated to reflect the caveat that Trump hadn't endorsed Good in his 2024 race.

Then, in order to further show his support for Trump, Good traveled to Manhattan less than two weeks ago to attend Trump's New York hush money trial. He was joined by a group of GOP lawmakers including Reps. Andy Biggs, Lauren Boebert, Michael Cloud, Eli Crane, Matt Gaetz, Diana Harshbarger, Anna Paulina Luna, Ralph Norman and Andy Ogles.

McGuire, Good's challenger, also attended court that same day.

""We are President Trump's voice. We have his back. He will ultimately be proven innocent,"" Good told reporters outside the courthouse on May 16.

However, Trump said ""the damage had been done.""

McGuire thanked the former president for his endorsement on X, writing ""We can do better than Good."" McGuire has sought to frame himself as an ""America First"" candidate, closely aligning himself with Trump as he slammed Good's loyalty to him.

In his endorsement message, Trump went on to praise McGuire's service as a Navy Seal, adding that he is ""strong on crime, will protect our great Military/Vets, and will always defend our under siege Second Amendment.""

However, Trump isn't the only high-profile Republican to back McGuire. Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy also threw his support behind McGuire, using his large political infrastructure to target Good, who was one of the eight Republican lawmakers who voted alongside Democrats to oust McCarthy from his speakership role last year.

Good and McGuire will face off in Virginia's 5th Congressional District GOP primary on June 18. The seat is solidly Republican and whichever candidate is successful in June is believed to have an easy path to victory during the general election cycle.","Two men are shown speaking at a podium with microphones, one with a blue tie and the other with a red tie, against a backdrop of a clear blue sky and a crowd of people.",<PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=224x126 at 0x7D6BA24D9DB0>,2024-05-28 17:16:11+00:00,https://abcnews.go.com,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-endorses-gop-rep-bob-goods-primary-challenger/story?id=110608064,['Politics' 'National'],[0.95 0.85],Likely,Likely,sample_review/images/d62c1d0781.png
